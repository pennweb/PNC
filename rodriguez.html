<p>
JOYCE APPLEBY:  It's certainly fitting that Richard Rodriguez should open
our third
section of the agenda because he has written so trenchantly about the
community of language and the language of community.  Yesterday
when we were talking with Chris Edley about how we
changed our minds and how perceptions and attitudes could be
modified, and in thinking about introducing Richard Rodriguez, I
thought that, for most of us, or for many of us, these changes have
come by reading a powerful book.  And that was certainly the case for
me, and I'm sure others, in reading Richard Rodriguez's autobiography,
"Hunger of Memory." Because, as you'll recall, it came out in '82 at
the very beginning of the period in which the country was engaging
formally and informally with issues of multiculturalism and identity
politics.  And he evoked, certainly, the issue of personal choice that
is involved in shaping one's identity and choosing one's
community.  So it's, as I said, entirely fitting that he should
develop these questions this morning around immigration and community
and the way in which immigration and concerns about immigration
force us to define our national community or even our local community,
as one of the greetings that we did indicates.
<p>
Richard Rodriguez is a Californian, through and through.  He was born
in San Francisco, grew up in Sacramento, got his degree at Stanford.
After his work at Stanford he studied at  Columbia and then at
UC Berkeley and also at the Warburg Institute in London.  His
prize-winning "Hunger of Memory" was followed by "Days of Obligation,"
which was also a contender for prizes.  He is now an editor with the
Pacific News Service, as we all know, a regular essayist on "The
MacNeil-Lehrer Hour" and writes frequently for The New York Times, for
Mother Jones, for The Wall Street Journal and The New Republic and
other publications.
<p>
It's with a great deal of pleasure that I introduce Richard Rodriguez
and sit down and look forward to what he's going to tell talk to us
about this morning.
<p>
RICHARD RODRIGUEZ:  Thank you very much.  I'm very
honored to be here in this room, particularly, and to be talking
to you today.  You know, parachuting into a meeting like
this, one feels ultimately awed by the company of this
commission, but also by the impossibility of knowing exactly how to be
useful, and I come first with the apology that my ambitions in
my working life are literary, and though I write about
social and political issues and cultural issues, the
intent always is for a kind of literary elegance.  I'm an essayist
and--at least in my own mind --that is of less and less significance
in the world of Border's Books.
<p>
But there I become a journalist and it is probably as a journalist
that I'm coming to you today, to talk about the world that
I'm beginning to see, the world of the United States of America.  I
hope these comments are useful, and if they're not, then, perhaps, in
the question-and-answer period, I can direct some of your
concerns more--or at least address some of your concerns more
directly.
<p>
I should say, secondly, as a preface, that the title of my
presentation, which is "Immigration and the Fracturing of Society," is
not my title.  It's not bad.  It's not a bad title, "Immigration and the
Fracturing of Society," but I'm very much interested in immigration, and
very much have been
seen as an apologist for immigration in recent years.  And
even though I'm not an apologist for illegal immigration, I have been
certainly one of the voices in California that have been urging a
kind of calm about the issue, because I think it has been a
problem overstated more than real.  Nonetheless, I want to
talk about illegal immigration in the course of these comments today.
<p>
The fracturing of society is an interesting way of thinking about
immigration because it seems to me that there is something profoundly
unsettling about immigration and the American experience.  Think of
Franklin's own wondering about whether Germans belong in this
country--German Catholics belong in this country.  I've always been
intrigued by the debate in the 1840s--the debate of nativists against
the Irish immigration, having to do more with religion than with
ethnicity or race, certainly; the argument being, as war was
brewing with Mexico, that if you allowed the Irish into the country,
you would jeopardize the Protestant states.  The--the--the Irish
would--would--would join with their Mexican brothers, fellow
Catholics, and challenge the Protestant primacy of the United States.
I've always thought that was a pretty good argument against Irish
immigration, except that it didn't take into account Pat Buchanan,
which is to say it didn't take into account the fact that maybe
Irish Catholics could become Protestant over time in their
culture. <p>

We use Canadian words like multiculturalism these days, but I'm
very much a believer that the United States of America exists and
that you swallowed me a long time ago.  It may be that I'm about to
swallow you, but that's yet to be seen.
<p>
The interesting thing about the Irish, of course, is that a
number of them did rebel against the United States--the San Patricios
in Mexico during the Mexican War.  There were a number of young Irish
recruits who fought on the American side for a time and then changed
sides.  About their story, you hear almost nothing in American history
books.  But I assure you that in Mexico they are very
well-known.  The St.  Patrick's Brigade, or the
San Patricios--changed sides and fought for Mexico against the United
States of America.  About half of them were apprehended by
US troops and were hung in the zocalo in Mexico City as an example.
About half of them escaped.  Some of them became members of great
Mexican families.  Werner Gorman, for example, the muralist, comes
from that Irish family.  There they were and the leader
of the pack, a man named Jack Ryan, whose
interest in Mexico may have had more to do with cantinas than with the
ideology, ends up disappearing in Mexico.  I'm very much interested in
Jack Ryan and what he represents. <p>

There is something unsettling about immigrants because they do
turn America--or they  undo America, it seems to me.
At the very point at which we think we have a communal
identity, at the very point at which we know who we are--Protestants,
united from Western Europe--suddenly the immigrants come from Southern
Europe or from Eastern Europe and suddenly we don't know exactly what they
mean to our community.  The great arguments of the natives against
immigrants
in the 19th century had more to do with religion than--than anything
else, the question of whether a Jew could be an American,
whether or not a Catholic could be an American.  And it suggests
to me that there really wasn't a 19th century in a way that we don't
quite understand now, a deeper appreciation of the theological basis
of this country, which was Low Church Protestant,
and remains so, in my opinion, as a good Irish Catholic today.
<p>
It is true that after a generation or two, usually by the
grandchildren of the immigrants, there is a tendency in
the United States to romanticize the immigrant, to see the immigrant
as precisely the meaning of America, to see the immigrant as the
figure who teaches us most about what it means to be an
American, the person who comes and remakes herself in this new land.
And the immigrant, in mythological terms, goes from being the
outsider to being at the very center of the mythology of the
country.  None of this, of course, do we say to the Vietnamese
immigrant who serves us our breakfast this morning at the hotel.  But
I think in about maybe another 40 years, we will be
prepared to say that about the Vietnamese immigrant, that
he, with his breakfast tray--he is the meaning of Philadelphia.
<p>
Before that, before romanticization, we are very much engaged in
issues of money and issues of labor.  My landlord in San
Francisco, who does not think we need more immigrants in this country
and certainly does not approve of illegal immigration,
nonetheless, when it came time to get a new roof for our very
lavish restored Victorian house, sought three bids.  It was rather
like a Shakespearean puzzle with these three different caskets--one of
silver, one of gold and one of lead.  The golden
casket was from the yuppie firm in San Francisco and the bid
was for $17,000 to reroof the building.  Lot of money.  The next bid,
the silver bid, came from a much less distinguished roofing company
and that was for $11,000.  And the third bid came from a group
of men who are Salvadorans, who do not speak English and who required
only that they be paid in cash, no questions asked.  And they
would reroof our Victorian house in beautiful San
Francisco, our charming Victorian house built in the 1860s--the house
that reminds us of what genteel San Francisco used to be like when
three generations lived behind one oak door.  They would reroof our
house for $7,000.  They were the ones that were hired.
<p>
I should tell you that I had the very, very strange impression
yesterday, flying out against the time of day, that
sitting on the airplane, reading a newspaper, I had the
strangest impression that I do not exist.  I was reading, I think it
was USA Today, and there was a report from Gallup.  The Gallup Poll
had conducted a survey on race relations on America.  And it
had found out that race relations in America are
very bad, especially, incuriously, as you go higher up on the economic
ladder.  For example, college-educated blacks were very, very
pessimistic about their relationships, their racial relationships.
But then it turned out as you read this article that it was only
concerned with white and black Americans.  There were no references to
the Vietnamese man who served me breakfast today.  There was certainly
no reference to the Chinese grocer at the corner.  There was no
reference to the Guatemalans in San Francisco or to the Salvadorans
who reroofed our Victorian house.  None at all.  And that was because
in the American conversation, when we talked about race, the conversation
has been conducted in white and black. <p>

What I represent, I would like to suggest to you this morning--I
represent a kind of rude intrusion into that conversation.  And in
that sense, I begin the task of unsettling the United States of
America.  I will undo your conversation.  Because it seems to me at
times, listening to this black-and-white conversation, as I have for
most of my life, a brown man in this country, that it had, ultimately,
nothing to do with me and that in various ways that I was supposed
to attach myself to one side or the other at will.  What was this
white-and-black dialectic?  Why does it admit so little
reference to anyone else? <p>

Listening last night, late at night, because I couldn't
go to sleep, the discussion of the O.J.  Simpson trial on one of these
remote channels that no one should watch--Bill Clinton, who strikes me
as the last black-and-white president of the United States, who,
nonetheless, in San Diego this weekend, will refer, and rather
dramatically in his strong terms, to the fact that now we are a
multiracial, multiethnic society, multicultural--Canadian language.
<p>
But Bill Clinton, in referring to the O.J.  Simpson trial,
referred to the fact that the O.J.
Simpson trial taught whites and blacks and others to look at
ourselves, he said.  It wasn't clear what we were supposed to see, but
it taught us to look at ourselves.  And I thought to myself, `There it
is:  "the others." I am the other at this conversation.'
<p>
I noticed that there are almost no Hispanics in this room, or I
suspect that there are very few Hispanics in this room, and 
I do not see very many Asian faces in this room.  And I wonder,
without intending any rudeness, what you make of that absence, how we
conduct an American conversation, in this day and age, in 1997,
without Hispanic and Asian faces.
<p>
I'm sounding more regressive than I mean to, but it's 6:00 in the
morning in California and perhaps that's my problem.  My broadness
represents something else, and it's that other thing that I would like
to stress this morning, and that's some notion of impurity into the
American conversation.  Against the notion of white and
black, the notion of brownness, I would like to suggest, does
not represent a third race, but rather some blurring of racial
distinction.  I ask you to look at me carefully and to listen to what
you are hearing.  I am speaking to you in American English
that was taught me by Irish immigrant women in California.  I've
always liked the Irish nuns.  They always liked the irony
of having been taught English --the Queen's English--by the
Irish.  I also carry this Indian face and a Spanish surname as well as
this California first name.
<p>
You might wonder about the complexity of historical factors, the
collision of centuries, that creates Richard Rodriguez.  Because my
brownness is a[n] exact result of that collision.  And I come to
you as an impurity.  There is no adjective that attaches to the
Mexican in the American lexicon more easily, more frequently, than the
dirt--than the adjective `dirty'--dirty Mexican.  In the 19th century,
the Texans used to say that the reason that Mexicans were so easy to
defeat in battle is because we had diluted the strength of
being either pure Indian or pure Conquistador, pure Spaniard, by
mixing.
<p>
We were race-mixers, and, as you know, in the American
experience, that is not a thing we
celebrate easily to this day.  We speak more easily
about our diversity than we do about the fact that I might become you
or that I might begin dating your daughter or that you might become my
next-door neighbor or that we might eat the same food or that we
might be the same people or that I might be in love with you.  We
settle more easily on the Canadian notion of diversity because I think
it keeps us intent on the notion that we are separate, that our elbows
do not have to touch, that I do not have to become you, that I can
remain Mexican, whatever that means, in the United States of America,
and Sacramento, California, with Irish nuns.
<p>
I was invented in 1973 by Richard Nixon.  Richard Nixon had
instructed the Department of Management and Budget to determine
the major racial and ethnic groups in this country,
and they came up with five.  You can imagine this
bureaucratic liberation over the phone books of America.  They came up
with five.  They are in no order of preference--white, black,
Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian and, last but not least,
ladies and gentlemen, the Hispanic.  I'm Hispanic.
<p>
The interesting thing about Hispanics, of course, is that you never
meet a Hispanic in Latin America.  I've yet to meet one in Latin
America.  You meet Chileans and Peruvians and Mexicans.  You do not
meet Hispanics.  If you ask them about Hispanics, they have heard that
there are Hispanics up in Dallas, but they themselves have never
met any.  `Hispanics' is rather one of those strange gringo
contrivances like flavorless salsa that you find only in Dallas,
Texas.  It is a strange new definition of the world that suggests that
I have more in common with Argentine-Italians than I have with
American Indians, that there is more uniting the white Cuban and
the mulatto Puerto-Rican than there is differentiating them.
<p>
Very interesting conclusion Richard Nixon reached, and 
those conclusions have been the basis for the way we organize our
society, the way we think about what the community of this room is.
As a Hispanic, I will tell you, and with some irony--I will tell you,
nonetheless, that two statistics recently from the Census Bureau
interest me very much.  The first statistic that was--this was
as recent as two--three--three weeks ago.  The Census Bureau told
us in Washington that by the year 2005--by the year 2005, which is not
so far away, Hispanics will outnumber blacks in the United States, to
become, as we have been ready to become for some time now, the largest
minority in the United States.  And I would like to suggest to you
that is a real issue that we face in this country--Hispanic and black.
<p>
The Rand Corporation published, about two weeks
ago, this study on immigration in which they concluded after
all immigration is a plus, economically, for the United States,
though they admitted that the competition at the bottom is where
the real action is, and that Karl Marx--though they did not say this,
I will say this--Karl Marx was wrong.  It was never rich against poor;
it was poor against near-poor.  If you want to see the competition
in Los Angeles today, between black and Hispanic, go to the
bottom.
<p>
I would remind you that the first suit brought in bilingual Miami,
brought against the necessity that I need to speak Spanish to
have this job, was brought by two black cleaning women who were
suddenly told by their Cuban employers that in order to push
that broom and mop that bathroom, they needed to speak the language of
Cortez.  And they brought suit.  I will tell you also that in the
famous black neighborhoods of Los Angeles today, this moment, at 6:15
in the morning in Los Angeles, the famous black neighborhoods of Los
Angeles--Compton, Watts, south central--are all becoming Hispanic.
Watts will become in its majority Hispanic within the next
three or four years.  There is a competition in Los
Angeles right now at City Hall between Hispanic and black that is real
and fierce, and the Hispanic backing of Richard Riordan against
the black backing of Tom Hayden will have real political
consequences for Los Angeles.
<p>

But while I want to say that, and I want to admit that this
competition exists, I also want to tell you that the comparison of
Hispanics to blacks--the comparison carried too far, I think, leads
ultimately to complete nonsense.  There is no such thing as a Hispanic
race.  There is no Hispanic race in the world.  You go to Latin
America, you see every race of the world.  You see white Hispanics,
you see black Hispanics, you see brown Hispanics who are Indians, many
of whom do not speak Spanish because they resisted.  You see
Asian-Hispanics; one of them runs one of the largest countries of
South America.  There is no Hispanic race, so to compare blacks and
Hispanics already risks comparing--well, I don't even want to say
apples and oranges.  I would say apples and kitty cats.  They're not
comparable, at some level.
<p>
We don't even know this about ourselves.  We've gotten so used to
impersonating a third race now, the great new third race in America.
I was at Yale University.  This tedious woman was chasing me all
afternoon, not with romantic intention, but rather to tell me how
wrong I was about some political opinions I have.  And I thought to
myself, you know, `How am I going to get rid of her?' She kept on
telling me that she was the first Hispanic at Yale to do this, the
first Hispanic to win this prize.  She now works at some law firm
in Park Avenue.  And so the day went and I thought to myself, `Well,
maybe she needs a cup of coffee.' And we sat down and she
turns out that she's a Cuban, a white Cuban.
Nothing wrong with being a white Cuban.  Ricky Ricardo was a white
Cuban.  But she started telling me about the fact that Hispanics are
at Yale University in this predicament or that.  And then
she said, you know, `We people of color,' and I thought to myself, you
know, `Maybe I'm traveling too much.  Maybe she didn't even know
what color she was.  So much for a Yale education.
<p>
The most interesting thing about Mexico, the country of my ancestry
is that Mexico may be in a calamity right now.  Mexico may be a
mess.  Mexico may be collapsing for various reasons and in various
ways.  But Mexico has one boast that I pass along
to you and that was that we joined the world in Mexico.  Jose
Vasconcelos, the great Mexican educator and philosopher, talks about
the Mexican as la raza cosmica, the cosmic race, that in Mexico
what one finds as early as the 18th century already is the
predominant population of mixed-race people.  The mestizo predominated
over the pure European or the pure Indian by the 18th century.  By the
18th century, the slave had been freed in Mexico and the intermarriage
rate between the Indian and the African in Mexico was greater than in
any other country in the Americas and has never been equal since.
<p>
Jose Vasconcelos calls us la raza cosmica, by which he means not
simply that we are Indian, not simply that we are Spanish, but that we
are Africans, homos negros, and that we are Asians, homos chinos.
There is no country in the Americas that speaks in such a way about
its mixture, speaks with such pride.  I would like to argue that
instead of thinking of the Canadian model of multiculturalism, you
might begin to think of the Mexican alternative of a mestizaje
society, away from the multicultural safety that Canada offers me.
<p>
Hispanic is not a racial term, as I say; it is an ethnic term.
It is a term of culture.  So when you hear the Census Bureau say
in the second place --that by the year 2050--by the year
2050, by midcentury, one-fourth of all Americans will identify
themselves as Hispanic, think about what you are hearing.  You are not
hearing that by the year 2050 one-fourth of all Americans will be
brown, you are hearing that by the year 2050 one-fourth of all
Americans will identify themselves culturally, which is to say, the
black Dominican today who identifies himself as Hispanic is
identifying himself by virtue of culture rather than by virtue of
race, and that is revolutionary--that in a country that
takes its understandings of community from race and color, to have
that large a group of Americans identify themselves by virtue of
language or the identification of culture, is an extraordinary
change and a revolutionary one and I--as I say, I come to this
conversation as a rude intrusion.
<p>
The only question I'd like to pose this morning is do we exist as a
culture?  Is there a Hispanic culture?  Do we mean something
culturally in the United States.  Henry Cisneros, a few years ago, in
a room very much like this, when he was the golden boy of
the Hispanic movement, gathered together a group of Hispanic
politicians to try to determine whether there was Hispanic politics in
America, a Hispanic political agenda, and, indeed, there is a Hispanic
caucus very much modeled on the African-American caucus in Washington.
You never hear much about it because after two weeks, the group
that Henry Cisneros convened could not come up with an
agenda.  There is no Hispanic politics.  What, after all, unites
the eighth-generation New Mexican, who considers himself a Spaniard,
with the white Republican Cuban with the black Puerto-Rican with the
Guatemalan Indian who has just arrived in San Diego yesterday with the
Mexican-American gang kids who speak neither English nor
Spanish in East LA?  What common interest unites these people?  Which
is another way of saying, `What culture is there in this company?'
<p>
Some Hispanics speak Spanish.  Some do not.  Some are Catholic.  Many
are becoming Evangelical Protestants.  Some are white.  Some are
brown.  Some are black.  The more I think about it, the more I think
that one of the few things that unites us--actually the only two
things that unite us--one is this business of impurity,
that we are making it--America--an impure place.  And the second thing
that unites us is that we look south when we think of the past.  That
is our revolutionary gift to you, our cultural inheritance that we
bring to this country.  We are changing the contour of this country
because we are north-south people.  And in a country that has always
written its history east to west, that has always begun its history in
places like this room, begins its history in New England and
writes the American story east to west across the page, ending up at
Venice Beach, in a country that has always understood itself in one
direction only--suddenly, you have millions of Americans who now see
themselves on a north-south trajectory.  That is revolutionary.
<p>
I'd like to propose to you that NAFTA is a new idea in the United
States, the notion of a North American Free Trade Agreement, the
notion of a North American, indeed--the notion that we are related
in any way to Canada, a country we barely notice, and Mexico, a
country we noticed only to take half of her territory in
the 19th century.  I remember when NAFTA was signed in I think it
was in Austin, Texas--San Antonio.  The dreary New York Times called
me up and they said, `Would you write something on NAFTA?' And I said,
`I can't write anything on NAFTA.  I've never met a North American.  
I think such a creature does not exist.'
<p>
And I thought to myself, `Well, actually, I do know one.  I do know
one North American.' In fact, I still know him to this day.  He is
a Mexican from the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico.  He
impersonates an Italian chef in an Italian restaurant at a
restaurant in the Napa Valley for about nine months of the year.
He is trilingual.  He is a Mixteco Indian.  The first language
that he speaks is Mixteco.  His second language is the language of his
Colonial oppressors, Spanish.  His third language is--he has a working
knowledge of English, because, after all, he works here.  He deals
with two currencies--dollars and pesos.
<p>
He knows thousands of miles of dirt roads and freeways.  He knows
where to hide because he is, after all, illegal.  On the United States
side he knows how to hide from the US Border Patrol; on the Mexican
side, he knows how to hide from the federal officers who are always
trying to steal his money.  He sends his money home in
Western Union `grams' and he hides the rest in his shoes.  He lives in
a 16th-century village in Mexico where the Virgen de Guadalupe floats
over his wife's bed.  In Napa Valley, where everybody's on
a diet, there is no Virgen de Guadalupe.  There is only Madonna, the
Material Girl.
<p>
He is the first North American.  He sees this hemisphere whole.  He is
a peasant.  And at Harvard, they are now--at the Harvard Business
School, they are now talking about this North American, this
global reality as through it is a new idea.  The peasant has known
about it from Mexico and Puerto Rico for about 80 years now.
<p>
There is a quarrel right now, the deepest struggle, I think, going
on in California about mythology.  Which myth applies?  What does
California mean?  What is California?  For a long time now, we have,
in the United States, been under the impression that California was
the Far West.  That was the conventional view of California.  `Go
West, young man.' `Go West, young man, and change the color of your
hair and go to Gold's Gym, get a new body, lose weight, become a
movie star, change your name, drop your embarrassing surname, become
Rock Hudson.' The meaning of the Far West, as early as the 1860s, the
American discovery in California was of finitude.  We had come to the
end of the road in California.  America was a finite idea.  So in
California, in the 1860s, with John Muir, already, the environmental
movement begins, the need to preserve the land, the need to take
caution.  It does not begin in these crowded brick
cities of the East Coast, this notion of a finite America.  It begins
at the end of the continent.
<p>
I've always thought that the innovation that comes in California
results from its being at that location, at the edge--the suicide
capital.  You know, we think about the Heaven's Gate suicides of
a few months ago--in the 1920s, Edmund Wilson talks about this in "The
Great Earthquake." In the 1920s, the suicide capital of the United
States was San Diego, which also had one of the highest
incidences of mental illness.  And Wilson concludes that this is
what happens when you come to the end of the road.  You have been told
that everything will be OK if you move West.  Having gotten there with
no place more to move, what do you do now?  You look to the sky.  I
think it's no coincidence that along that coast of California, in
1911, already, in San Diego and Point Loma, the first 
New Age religions begin to emerge.  Religious eccentricity
of various sorts flourish in California.  We have to reinvent
paradise.
<p>
We also, it seems to me, now have to reinvent the notion of infinity.
And I think it's no coincidence so much technological innovation is
happening along that strip of land that stretches from North County,
San Diego, all the way up now to Redmond, Washington.  Why there?  Why
are people entering cyberspace with such ease at that place
on the land?  I'd like to suggest that maybe it has to do with the
fact that what we know at the Far West is that the land has come to an
end.
<p>
But has it?  There is today, in about an hour, a procession of planes
coming to LAX from Asia, and the nativists keeps telling the
Asian, you know, that `We are sort of glad to see
you, but we don't have any more room in California.  We've come to the
end of things in California.' And the Asian says, `Well, you know,
I've always thought this was where America begins.  I thought this was
where the continent begins.' What will the history of America look
like if you write it in reverse, if you write it from west to east?
Have we even imagined such a history?
<p>
And then there was my father--I used to go to the cowboy movies and I
would always root for the cowboys against the Indians, but my
infuriating father, my Mexican father, who always was out there to
convince me I didn't live in the West at all, but in the el norte.
What was el norte, for God's sakes?  Were there any cowboys in el
norte?  People in Mexico go to el norte not because they want to find
a new future, they go to el Norte because they want a dreary job
working at a dry cleaner's in LA.  People go to el Norte without the
same sense of disconnection from the past that the Western traveler
had.  You travel east to west and follow the light of the day.  You leave
the past
behind.  You travel north and south and you begin to resemble a
monarch butterfly or a whale.  You move with the seasons.
<p>
The laborer who worked six months of the year in the North and
returned South every year, who infuriated Americans, because they
didn't understand what that north-south journey might mean.  And now
we are becoming north-south people.  All over this country you see it.
You see grandmothers in Minnesota who live not in some
east-west calendar, but by north-south calendar.  They
spend their warm months in Minneapolis and they spend the cold, cold
months in Florida.  And all over the country now I meet teen-agers who
are basically not between coast-to-coast, as we used to imagine this
country, but between hot and cold, between desert and tundra--the new
extremities of this country, the new way that America exists, a
north-south direction, solsticio, seasonal, pagan.
<p>
I think to myself, you know, of all the things that Bill Clinton
represents for me --that nothing he did compares to NAFTA, this
notion given to the United States that you are related to Canada and
you are related to Mexico.  You go to northern Mexico, and, god, it
looks like San Diego these days.  Northern Mexico's filled with Gold's
Gyms and Hard Rock Cafes.  Everybody wants to be an American in
northern Mexico.  Everybody in northern Mexico knows what it is like
to be a neighbor of the United States of America, the way you will
hear her music, the way you will taste her food, the ways she is
inevitable.
<p>
You go to south Texas, of course, and it's becoming very Mexican these
days.  And it surprises us because our notion of community never
extended beyond our borders and certainly never extended in those
directions.  If you look at the map now, the Hispanic map of the
United States of America, and one of the weirdest things that's going
on now is the reconquest of the Spanish Empire--Florida, Colorado, New
Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California, Nevada.  Hispanic--just as they
were in the early 18th century.
<p>
Los Angeles, the immigrant city, the immigrant capital,
the new Ellis Island.  Los Angeles--this morning in Los Angeles, the
Aztecs are playing Little League baseball and the Mayans are making
beds at the Holiday Inn.  We are under the conviction in Los Angeles,
of course, that the Indians died.  We wrote that in the movies we
made for a long time, but the Indians are everywhere in Los Angeles,
and one of these mornings in one of those dreary sort of side page
pieces, The New York Times is going to announce that the Indian did
not die.  The Indian is everywhere in Los Angeles.
<p>
I know that there are people in this room concerned by diminished
civility in the United States of America and especially in a city like
Los Angeles.  But may I suggest that there are uses of
incivility, too.  And I don't want to be casual about this, but I do
think that the formation of a society does not
happen easily--that does not happen with all of us feeling good
about each other, does not happen because we all sort of like each
other.
<p>
Coca-Cola has this dreary commercial that they pull out at
Christmastime where they have everybody come sing about Coca-Cola with
these ethnic costumes, and we all sing about this universal experience
of Coca-Cola as Poles or as Czechs or as Mexicans or as
Japanese--well, it doesn't happen that way.  Birth doesn't happen that
way with all of us feeling good about each other.  Sometimes birth
happens at Denny's when the red-headed waitress has to communicate
with the Mexican who's flipping the pancakes, and she doesn't
have the words and so it ends up with this compromise which
is--`Dos huevos, over easy!' she screams back to him.  `Dos
huevos over easy'--I thought to myself--well, that's sort of
interesting.
<p>
1992 we had in Los Angeles, one of the great
urban riots of American history, a terrible event that began as a
black-and-white event but within hours, ended up involving Korean
businessmen, and you ended up the next day with Salvadoran women
resting with Mexican women outside of Kmart for boxes of Pampers.  You
cannot have a black-and-white riot in a multiracial city.  We still
haven't learned that yet.
<p>
The most interesting thing about that riot for me was the way
the city got formed in the riot, from the terror of those evenings.
On the famous West Side--the famous West Side of the city--everyone
went to bed--I think it was that first Thursday--and you saw on
television neighborhoods that you never had to visit.  LA was famous,
after all, as the city of separate suburbs, separate freeway exits.
You never went to that other part of town, and there it was.  You saw
it on television.  But the interesting thing about that evening is the
way those neighborhoods got closer and closer and closer.  And by
about 4 in the morning, you began to hear fire sirens on the West Side
of town.  And you could begin to smell the smoke and for the first
time, I would like to argue--for the first time, Los Angeles realized
that it was one city.
<p>
And it didn't realize this out of some good feeling.  It realized this
in terror.  People went to their closets for guns and suddenly
realized that `This street, the street I live on, is, in fact,
connected to their street,' and that we do not live in separate parts
of town, after all.  We live in a single city.  We have still not
gotten over it.  We are still terrorized by that knowledge.  There are
people in Los Angeles who still will not drive downtown because of
what they know, that we are one.
<p>

I'm running out of time.  There's so much I need to tell you.  I
was standing recently in Tijuana, a city that interests me very much.
I think of it as the true capital of California, not
Sacramento--Tijuana, the city that Gramps used to go to at night.
Tijuana, where generations of American men went.  Whenever anything
was illegal in the United States you could get it in Tijuana, what was
Mexico, after all, but lawless.  When boxing was illegal in San Diego,
you went to see boxing in Tijuana.  When gambling was
illegal in San Diego, you got it in Tijuana.  When drugs,
women--women--women, booze--Tijuana.
<p>
I was doing a documentary for British television recently in Tijuana
on Avenida Revolucion, and on Saturday nights you can still see the
teen-agers come from San Diego into Tijuana and I asked these girls,
`Now why'--this is on a British television.  `Why, at a time in which
you can do anything in San Diego--you can change your sex, have an
abortion, take drugs--you can do anything in San Diego--why do you
come to Tijuana?' The girls said to the British audience--she said,
`Because it's cool to get drunk in Mexico.' Impure Mexico, lawless
Mexico, sinful Mexico--they're giving us our drugs, you know.  If we
could only stop them from producing drugs, we would not have a drug
problem in San Diego.
<p>
Sometimes I stand there on the line between San Diego and Tijuana and
I talk to those kids.  I do not talk to them about Benjamin Franklin
or Tom Paine.  They've never heard of the Bill of Rights.  They are
coming, they say--they are coming, many of them illegally--they are
waiting for dusk to make a run.  They are coming because there is
a job in Glendale waiting for them or they are picking peaches near
Tracy and they know somebody who can get them a job.  They are not
coming for welfare.  They're not coming for our famous freedoms.
<p>
There is no politician I know of who will tell you the truth, and that
is that we cannot stop them from coming.  The fact is that there is a
2,000 border than cannot be fully defended.  We insist
in this day and age of speaking of illegal immigration
and we talk of Mexicans or we talk of Albanians or we talk of Turks
and we talk of Nigerians.  All over the world, the illegal immigrant
has a nationality, but I tell you that the real interest
that I have in these kids is not so much that they are Mexican, but
that the poor cannot be stopped.  The poor are mobile all over the
world.  And we of the middle class--we do not know how to
stop them, how to keep them out of our society, and the truth is that
we don't want to keep them out of our society.  And these Mexican kids
know.  They know that you will hire them to wait with your dying
mother.  They know that you will hire them to do their gardening.
They know that you will hire them to make your pizzas.
<p>
In Mexico, there are two ways.  There is the
realm of the public in which the politician says one thing and
everyone knows the opposite is true.  The judge says, `Five years,'
and everyone knows, `Well, it could be five years or a year.' And the
price of the jar in the store says 50 pesos and it might be 50 pesos
and it might be 10.  Nothing is what it seems in the public realm.
And Mexicans hear Pete Wilson.  The Mexicans hear Bill Bennett or the
Mexicans hear Bill Clinton talk about illegal immigration and they
know that the public means one thing and the private means another.
There is work in San Diego if you can make it across.
<p>
There is something so innocent sometimes about that movement, so
innocent and so without ambition for ideology or nationality--simple
movement, adolescent movement, the journey north toward adventure.
There is something almost sexual about it sometimes.  You talk to
these kids in Los Angeles about how they come here at 14 and are
passing out leaflets on Broadway at 14.  It is like
asking a child to stay away from its mother's tit.  There is something
in the night that lures them.  And alternately, as we
realize that the gate will not hold, we are bringing them into our
house.
<p>
In the 1970s, I remember in Los Angeles at the very time when people
began to realize that LA might not be a West Coast city with palm
trees and beachfront, but might, in fact, be a desert city with
Indians.  At the very time when the very mythology of that city--from
blonde to brown--was changing, people began to romanticize
brownness on their terms.  They began to bring cactus into the house.
They took the curtains off the windows and brought the
desert light in.  And there was an aesthetic that attempted to deal
with something that was fearful, to make beautiful something that was
fearful. <p>

I tell you, the only way that fear is not only met
by withdrawal; sometimes fear is met by a kind of
seduction, that what you want to do when you fear the darkness, when
you fear the brown man in the dark, is that you look for brown men on
the soap opera that you can fall in love with.  There will be more
brown men on your soap opera, I tell you, as a fear of Mexico grows
deeper, not fewer.  We end up locking black males at an
extraordinary rate, I tell you, because we are afraid of black males
and we don't know what to do with black males, but we end up marrying
Chinese women because we don't know what to do with China either.
<p>
The great ancient societies--France would marry England--would give
her daughter to England as a way of placating England, as a way of
dealing with England, as a way of making England part of the family.
We are giving each other our daughters.  We are marrying each other as
much out of fear as out of some other yearning, I would
argue.
<p>
Meanwhile, at the Hollywood restaurant, which is smokeless, I was
talking to a Hollywood producer recently.  And he predicted that the
cowboy movie is about to make a resurgence.  We were surrounded by
these Indians, all of whom were serving us and cleaning our
plates.  And there was this Indian standing next to us as this
Hollywood producer said, `You know, I'll bet you, within 10 years,
that the Western is going to be the biggest genre in Hollywood films.'
And the Indian looked at us and said, `Decaf or regular?'
<p>
I have written against bilingual education, as some of you
know, and I'm skeptical of it because it does not work.  It does not
work.  And it is based upon a romantic pedagogy of using family
language in the classroom, which seems to betray both intimate
language and the proper purposes of classrooms, but no
further with that. <p>

People ask me all the time, `Do you envision another Quebec forming in
this country from all of this immigrant movement?  Do you see a
Quebec forming in the Southwest, for example?' And I say, `No, I don't
see that at all.' And, yes, Hispanics have the highest dropout rate of
any ethnic or racial group in this country from high school.  But, no,
I do not see Quebec forming.
<p>
I do see something different happening with the immigrant population
who are as much as 10 years younger than the national population, who
are more fertile than the national population.  I see their
movement as the movement of youth in a country that is growing
middle-aged.  We are now more than 33 years of age in a country that
is settling down more.  They are people of movement.  They are the
archetypal Americans at the time when we have become post-Americans.
<p>
And there is Shirley MacLaine, the actress, the
great-great-great-granddaughter of pioneers, who was under the
impression that she's a 14th-century Peruvian Indian at the very same
time that the Peruvian Indians in Los Angeles are converting to
Evangelical Protestantism.  And isn't that interesting, that the
granddaughters of pioneers are going to sit down and communicate with
the dead Indians while the live Indians are going to Los Angeles to
get jobs making beds at the Holiday Inn?  Evangelical
Protestantism at the rate at which Latin America's
converting now to Protestantism, the (unintelligible) suggested
that maybe by the year 2070, if this conversion continues in countries
as it is now, --Guatemala, Brazil--by the year 2070, Latin
America will be in its majority Protestant, and not simply Protestant
but Evangelical Low Church Protestant.  Praise the Lord.
<p>
I met three boys recently from a group called Victory Outreach,
[an] evangelical group which works along the border between the
United States and Mexico with kids who have serious drug or gang
problems, and here they were; 504 years after Columbus, here were
these three Indians who told me that they were coming to the United
States of America to convert the United States of America back to
Protestantism.  I thought to myself, `This doesn't seem like Quebec.
This seems like maybe the immigrants are bringing
America to us.' And one of the littlest ones said, you know, `Those
Americans,' he said, `are so sad.' `Well,' I thought to myself, `you
know, most Americans I know who are now Protestants are all becoming
Buddhists or animists or'--the only going religion in our public
school now is a kind of Native American animism where you separate
plastic from paper.
<p>
This year, Victory Outreach is sending
missionaries--504 years after Columbus, the Indian is going to Europe
to convert Europe to Christianity.  Victory Outreach is
sending missionaries to Paris, to London--where do you see this in
your New York Times?--to Frankfurt--where do you see this in your
Washington Post?  Victory Outreach is sending missionaries to
Amsterdam.  God bless them in Amsterdam.
<p>
I was at this small Apostolic assembly in East Palo Alto, oh, about
two years ago.  It's a mainly Spanish-speaking congregation.  It's
along 101, right near the heart of the Silicon Valley, just
across the freeway, from glamorous Palo Alto.  This is the other side.
It used to be black East Palo Alto.  It's quickly becoming
Asian and Hispanic Palo Alto, the same story.  There was a moment in
the service when newcomers to the
congregation were introduced to the entire group.  And they brought
letters of introduction from sister churches in Latin America.  And up
they came with their letters of introduction.  And the minister would
read the letter and would announce their name and their place of
origin to the entire community and everyone applauded.  And I thought
to myself, `It's over.  The border's over.'
<p>
These people were not being asked whether they had a green card.
They're not being asked whether they're legally here or illegally
here.  They are being welcomed within this community for reasons of
culture.  And there is now this north-south line that is theological
and it cannot be stopped by any Border Patrolmen.
<p>
By the year 2010, the Mormon Church, headquartered in Salt Lake City,
founded as the first great cowboy Christian church, the
Mormon church will be in its majority Spanish-speaking.  Most Mormons
will live in Latin America, at which time what will you make of Salt
Lake City?  You who worry about Quebec, what will you make when the
Mormons are in Mexico?  What do you know of Quebec?  
I would like to argue the deepest fear that we have of the
South right now is not of their separateness, but that they will
replace us, that they want us, that they want to be us, that they want
our food, that they want our culture.
<p>
Frank Gifford, when he was not otherwise engaged a few years ago, a
few months ago, "Monday Night Football" originated from
Monterrey, Mexico, a city in northern Mexico with all the charm of a
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the 1930s--Monterrey, Mexico, the city of
about four million people.  Monterrey, Mexico, was host that evening
on "Monday Night Football" to the Dallas Cowboys playing some other
team.  Dallas Cowboys--America's Team; wife-beaters and drug users.
And there at the beginning of the game was this serenade from a group
of mariachis in Spanish.  And you know what those
mariachis were singing in Spanish?  `The Dallas Cowboys are
our team.  They're Mexico's team.' And I thought to myself, `Does
anybody at ABC News know about this?  Do any of you realize that
you're about to be devoured?  Do you understand that people are
looking at you right now?' Monterrey, Mexico, has more
satellite dishes per capita than any other city in the
world, and they are pointed at you.
<p>
We keep looking to Canada.  We keep thinking multiculturalism is going
to make it all right.  It's not going to be all right.  You're going
to end up with Mexican grandchildren.
<p>
I was on the BBC recently, this dreary interview show, and this woman
introduced me as being in favor of assimilation. 
`Mr.  Rodriguez,' she said--`Mr.  Rodriguez is in favor of
assimilation.' I thought to myself, `I'm not in favor of assimilation
any more than I'm in favor of the Pacific Ocean.' If I had a bumper
sticker it would say something like `Assimilation happens.'
You don't sit there in the morning as an immigrant child and think to
yourself, `Well, how much American are you going to become today?' You
know, you're going to go down the street and you're going to be 40
percent Mexican and 60 percent American?  Isn't it a
concept?  You don't walk through life like a Canadian with
your elbows in, you know, trying to retain your identity.  Culture is
fluid.  It's in the air.  You breathe it.  You eat it.  You see it.
<p>
Elvis Presley goes in your ear and you cannot get Elvis Presley out.
He's in there.  I'm in favor of assimilation.  I'm not in favor of
assimilation.  I recognize that it exists.  LA has become Mexican,
which is what it always was.  Again.  LA has, right now--this city,
this monstrous city that we identify now as the immigrant capital of
America, has three times the miscegenation rate of any of the American
average.
<p>
And there I was in Merced, California, a few months
ago--Merced, California, which is this town in the central valley of
California, about 75,000 people, [in] which the two largest immigrant
groups now are Laotian Hmong and Mexicans.  And I
tell you, the Laotians have never in the history of the world, as far
as I know--no history book you ever gave me--the Laotian has never
lived next to the Mexican.  And there they are in Merced and they're
living next to the Mexican.  Mexican and Laotian--and they don't like
each other, which leads to commissions like this.  They don't like
each other.  And I was talking to these Laotian kids about why they
don't like Hispanic kids--or--I'm sorry, Mexican kids.  And they were
telling me this and they were telling me that and the Mexicans do this
and the Mexicans do that, and I thought to myself, you know,
`Something is not computing.' It was sort of like being in a jail
talking to my Hispanic prize winner.  Something's not computing.  And
I suddenly realized that these Laotian kids were speaking English with
a Spanish accent.
<p>
Thank you very much.
