A Brief Blurb about the PNC Resource Center.

</font> <P> 

This Resource Center organizes in one place all materials, original and
otherwise, of use to the PNC and its members, associated organizations,
and the general public. 
<p> 

You will find links to the Commission's transcripts, streaming video,
online journal, original research, associated organizations, and
bibliographic resources selected by the members. 
  <p> We have also collected here materials that are not otherwise published in 
    <a href=../publictalk2.html><i>Public Talk: The Online Journal of Discourse Leadership</i></a> 
    or that are of a sufficiently broad appeal to justify listing here as well 
    as in the journal. 
  <p> 

We have chosen several links to programs that are particularly important
to the Commission's work, both at the University of Pennsylvania and
elsewhere.  Additionally, the Commission has collected here all of the
"portals" developed to present the Commission's work to distinct
audiences, including Teachers, Major Professional Associations. 
<p>

Original materials produced by the Commission are available both as html
and in portable document format (PDF).  They are identified on our website
by this PDF icon:
