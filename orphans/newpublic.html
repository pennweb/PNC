From its inception in December 1996 to its concluding meeting in November
1999, the Penn National Commission on Society, Culture and Community
sought to understand the problems of contemporary public discussion and
behavior and to foster more engaged and thoughtful conversations about
contemporary social issues.


During the Commission's inaugural session, its chair and convenor,
University of Pennsylvania <a
href=http://www.upenn.edu/president/>President </a><a
href=http://www.upenn.edu/president/rodin/index.html> Dr. Judith
Rodin</a>, challenged <a href= ../members.html>48 scholars, political
leaders and shapers of public opinion </a> "to address the polarization,
oversimplification, and isolation from important cultural and intellectual
traditions that are increasingly characteristic of contemporary social and
political discourse."

<p>

With the 'study' phase of the Commission recently completed, the
Commission is now operating in its new 'programmatic' phase as the Penn <a
href=../ptsplash.html>Penn Public Talk Project </a>.  <a href=../sps.html>Dr.
Stephen Steinberg</a>, the Commission's executive director, and his staff
are spearheading a national effort to improve the practices of robust
discourse, or <i>public talk,</i> in ways that lead to stronger, more
inclusive
communities. <p>

<p>
The <a href=http://www.upenn.edu>University of Pennsylvania's</a>
educational philosophy, dating to the principles of its founder, Benjamin
Franklin, links the theoretical and the practical and makes the Penn
National Commission and its successor effort, the Penn Public Talk
Project, natural extensions of the University's core identity. The work of
the Commission and the Public Talk Project expresses Penn's fundamental
commitment to academic excellence, technological innovation in research
and communications, and the importance of bringing academic and
professional resources to bear on urgent social problems.

<p>
Between December 1996 and November 1999, Commission members deliberated
over the course of six thematically linked, semi-annual <a href=
../meetings.html>plenary meetings</a> that took place in Philadelphia,
Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.
<p>
Early in its discussions, the Commission identified three deficiences that
influence public behavior:  a<b> Failure of Leadership</b>, in the
continuing dialogue between and among leaders and constituencies; the<b>
Fragmentation of Communities</b>, in which race, class, ideology,
ethnicity, and special interests divide and sub-divide rather than unify
civic life; and a <b>Culture of Intolerance,</b> expressed in the
incivility, intolerance, and ideological polarization that dominate our
public discourse.
<p>
Commission members examined these problems through three working groups:
Culture and Public Behavior, Leadership in a Democratic Society, and 21st
Century Community.

<p>

Commission members' contributions at the plenary sessions and through the
working groups allowed the Penn National Commission to commission
research, papers and presentations that examined the current state of
discourse and its relationship to contemporary society and culture.  These
efforts allowed the Commission to:
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>
Document the Condition of Contemporary Public Discourse
</b>
<p>
What is the present state of public discourse?  In what specific respects
does it fail to approach the standard of "reasoned and reasonable"
discourse described by the commission?
<p>
<b>
Define Exemplary Public Discourse 
</b>
<p>
What is "reasoned and reasonable" discourse?  What are its component
elements?  How has it changed, if at all, over time?  How and why does it
work when it works well?
<p>
<b>
Identify the Principles and Conditions of Successful Discourse Leadership
</b>
</p>
What are the characteristics of effective discourse leadership on the part
of individuals?  What institutional practices promote communities that
foster strong and productive public discourse?  Is a strong community
associated with good discourse practices?  Can exemplary discourse
practices be used to reintegrate isolated subcommunities into a larger
society or bridge barriers of hostility between communities?
