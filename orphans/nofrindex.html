<p>
Forty-eight of the best minds from the United States and abroad have been
convened by University of Pennsylvania President Judith Rodin to take a
careful look at the contemporary explosion of intolerance, ideological
extremism, and incivility. Leading academics, writers, legal experts,
social scientists, politicians, and journalists, including several Penn
faculty, are working together over three years to understand the
origins of these phenomena and develop new ideas, approaches and
"ways of thinking differently" about contemporary issues that can reduce
the tendency to polarize every issue and demonize every opponent.
<p>
The Commission's general goal is to promote a robust and
diverse public culture  in which reasoned and reasonable discourse can
flourish.
<p>
The Commission arose out of a desire to demonstrate that the
knowledge and experience of our professional and scholarly communities,
both in and outside the academy, can be brought productively to bear on
major social and cultural problems as we begin to confront the complex
challenges of the next century.  Prominent among these problems is the
need, both in the U.S. and abroad, to create a more genuinely engaged and
productive public culture in which a reasoned and reasonable discourse
(though not necessarily a more "civil" one) is possible, despite
disruptive, market-driven, behavioral patterns.  In such a culture,
leadership and expertise would play a useful and appropriate role within
the context of democratic values, and a sense of shared community would
frame and facilitate energetic engagement about our real and valuable
disagreements over policies, politics, values, and other complex issues.
Rather than quashing debate or discord, the need is to foster a more
enthusiastic and substantive engagement across all kinds of differences.  
<p>
With this general framework in mind, the Commission is exploring and
addressing three major problem areas:  

<ul>
<li>The Culture of Intolerance 
<p><li>The Failure of Leadership
<p><li>The Fragmentation of Communities.  
<p></ul>

Each problem area is the focus of a working group of Commission members as
well as a future plenary meeting of the Commission.  From these activities
a variety of publications, research findings, initiatives, and other
materials will emerge.  Rather than issue a massive report and make
recommendations for others to act upon, the Commission hopes in this way
to generate and share broadly a body of ideas that will help to foster a
more reasoned and reasonable public discourse within a more robust and
diverse public culture.

<p>

The<a href=http://www.upenn.edu> University of Pennsylvania</a> is one of
the world's great international
research universities, with special strengths in the behavioral sciences,
American history and cultural studies, communications, law, business,
community service, and social policy.  Penn's historic and identifying
institutional characteristic has been its commitment to unifying <a
href=http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/v42/n26/presrpt.pdf>theory
and practice</a>, which dates back to the educational philosophy of its
founder, Benjamin Franklin, and led to many of the University's historic
"firsts" and its <a
href=http://www.upenn.edu/about>current
strengths</a> in professional education in medicine,
business, law, etc., as well as the arts and sciences.  These resources
make Penn a natural home for such a unique undertaking as the Penn
National Commission on Society, Culture and Community.  The Commission's
formation, under the leadership of <a
href=http://www.upenn.edu/president/rodin/index.html>Penn President Judith
Rodin</a>, expresses
the University's <a
href=http://www.upenn.edu/president/pennini.html#agendex>fundamental
commitments</a> to academic excellence, to the
betterment of our society, to technological innovation in research and
scholarly/professional communication, and to bringing the resources of our
international academic and professional communities to bear on urgent
social problems.
