<center> &quot;Report on Primary Tensions&quot;</center>
</font>
<br>
<center><font size=4>Robert Wiebe, Northwestern University and 
</center><center>Member, Penn National Commission</font></center><br><br>
<p>This report has two objectives:  to identify important tensions in
contemporary American public life that relate specifically to the Penn
Commission's work; and to state these tensions in a way that stresses the
necessity of choice.  By this I don't mean that the Commission or even our
working group must agree on a single choice, only that each of these
tensions by its nature should oblige anyone who addresses it seriously to
take a position.  The purpose of the report's back-and-forth format is to
express unresolved debates that might have continued indefinitely.
</p>
<br>

<b>1.  Setting the rules in public life.</b>
</center>
<br>
<p>Thoughtful, knowledgeable people, one argument goes, have the
ability and hence the obligation to define what constitutes a healthy
public life.  The Penn Commission is ideally constituted to try its hand.
Without rules on civility and the resolution of conflicts, public life
deteriorates into a jungle of passions.  Without a focus on the common
good
as Amy Gutmann has explained it, public exchanges are merely expressive,
not deliberative.  To be effective, democracy requires a rational
structure.
</p>
<p>        No rules are neutral, the response goes, and invoking code
words
like rationality won't make them so.  Rules on civility and deliberation
that suit one group--the comfortable, educated elite on the Penn
Commission, for example--block access for those who bring a different
style
and intelligence to public life.  By the same token, the keepers of the
rules, especially the agencies of the state, only serve the interests of
those powerful enough to reach them.  Hence rules in a genuine democracy
must be negotiated among all participants.  If there is such a thing as
the
common good, it needs to emerge out of the democratic process itself.  A
certain messiness, a certain risk, is a small price to pay for an
inclusive
public life.
</p><p>        An invitation to chaos, the first side replies.  Democratic
deliberation requires restraint: it is not therapy for everybody's
frustration.  Without some enforced rules, public exchange becomes a dog
chasing its tail: deliberation can't even begin.  Moreover, study matters.
Trained minds do see more and understand better than untrained ones, and
their very training protects against most of those hypothetical biases.

</p><p>        Of course public exchanges must begin somewhere, the second 
side responds.  What really matters is recognizing the exclusionary 
tendency in any set of <i>a priori</i> rules:  all rules must always be 
open for
renegotiation.  As for those superior minds, the public in a democracy
says: don't call me, I'll call you.  People won't be shy to ask for help
if
what they get really is help.
</p>

<b>2.  Informing citizens about public life.</b></center>

<p>        The guiding principle is simple, one argument goes.  Come as
close
as possible to making all information available to the public.  Though all
is obviously a fiction, it's serious fiction.  Don't withhold information
about public figures and public affairs because somehow it seems
irrelevant
to genuine public concerns.  A public figure's reputation is never an
excuse to suppress information.  Make it a cardinal rule of news media to
resolve all matters of doubt in favor of providing, not withholding
information.  Store government records in ways that allow them to be
retrieved as citizens request them.  Narrow the concept of national
security so drastically that only the most self-evident cases qualify as
confidential--and then for the least number of years.
</p><p>
On three grounds, all is an unacceptable guide, another 
argument goes.  First, long before something resembling it is reached, 
the public will have drowned in information.  All means dump all 
available junk on people who have neither the time nor the skill to sort 
amongst it for useful information.  If an informed public is the goal, 
all guarantees failure.  Second, an absence of filters for the flow of 
information is equivalent to an absence of public values.  We needn't 
pretend that relevance and rationality are mysteries: there are 
principles governing both.  And we shouldn't pretend there is no such 
thing as public decency. An overwhelming majority of the public knows 
better.  We should explore its boundaries, not ignore them.  Third, 
informing the public requires correcting for the bias of wealth.  An 
unmodified all surrenders the public to the rich and the powerful.  We 
need go no further than the error of Buckley v. Valeo and the advertising 
leverage of big business.  Together they translate into all the 
information privilege can buy.
</p><p>
        In reverse order, the first side responds, Buckley is not a
mistake; it is only incomplete.  Obsessing about money actually distracts
from the real issue: diversity.  Let money buy what it can, but open more
and more outlets for competing voices so that all sides are heard.
Second,
the history of free speech is strewn with obsolete standards of decency
and
discarded assumptions of relevance that at one time suppressed what we
would now consider essential to the public agenda.  Finally, remember the
principle of the garage sale: one person's junk is another's treasure.
Yes, do develop processing tools that would enable citizens to sort and
sift quantities of data, but never narrow the range of data.
</p><p>
        Processing tools are a euphemism for limitations, the other side
replies.  Don't pretend they are something else; simply be self-conscious
about the most sensible limitations for an informed public deliberation.
And don't invoke the history of free speech as if it were necessarily a
straight line, forever allowing more and more with fewer and fewer
restraints.  Certain kinds of speech may deserve levels of protection that
others do not--the Cass Sunstein proposition.  Finally, until those
hypothetical outlets for public expression come into existence, money
dominates and Buckley must go.
</p>

<b>3.  Mapping American society.</b></center>

<p> America's dearest tradition, one argument goes, is the equality of
individuals in public affairs and before the law.  Construing America in
any other terms violates the essential meaning of its democracy.  For
various purposes--countries of origin for immigrants, age levels for
social
services, and the like--categories of convenience make sense.  All of them
are mutable and none interferes with the individuality of each person in
the group.  Where, on the other hand, culturally constructed
categories--of
race in particular--take priority over individuals, we establish our
reality by fiat: "I was created by Richard Nixon in 1971," Richard
Rodriguez told us.  Assigning rights and rewards on those terms not only
diminishes the humanity of winners and losers alike; it also distorts
public policy by turning faddish categories of the moment into its
building
blocks.  It is one thing to punish tobacco manufacturers as knowing
poisoners; it is an entirely different thing to create a category of
nicotine addicts and compensate them for inhaling.
</p><p>
        No one lives outside a context, an alternative argument begins.
Everything we are, everything we know, is mediated by cultural contexts.
Even in a democracy, individuals are the supreme category of convenience.
Hence, as Robert Putnam has recently argued, we measure democracy's
strength not by the state of its citizen atoms but by the health of its
groups--its social capital.  Public policy always involves a search for
the
best groupings.  In fact, that is how justice is meted to individuals:
by not treating them individually.  Some contexts we choose;
many--probably
the most important--we do not.  Those, in effect, we inherit.  In the
United States, race and gender define the inherited categories with the
most profound consequences.  Fairness in contemporary policy depends on a
concentrated effort to redress these group legacies.
</p><p>
        Groups matter because they sustain individuals, the first case
replies.  Putnam doesn't expect everybody in a bowling league to emerge
with the same democratic stamp: individuals take it from there.  The law
may categorize, but individuals go to jail.  By the same token,
individuals
live out the consequences of group compensation.  How is it possible to
factor the significance--historical, contemporary, or otherwise--of race,
class, and gender in the cases of a penniless 19-year-old white woman from
the West Virginia mountains and a penniless 19-year-old black man from
Cabrini-Green in Chicago?  New arbitrary categories cannot overcome the
sins of earlier arbitrary categories; they simply generate new inequities
requiring ever newer corrections.  If we believe in a society of free
individuals, let's free individuals.
</p><p>
        The fact that individuals live, breathe, and die falls somewhere
between the solipsistic and the ho-hum, the alternative case responds.
What is unacceptable is the translation of this routine truth into a
glorification of a quite recent cultural phenomenon, which Michael Sandel
has called "the unencumbered individual" and which in his own way Robert
Bellah has also publicized.  By ignoring the context for our lives, these
writers explain, we impoverish it.  In the same fashion, by ignoring the
group basis for injustice, we cripple our capacity to correct it.  Most
Americans most of the time have understood that Jim Crow, restrictive
covenants, and union exclusions did not operate by forming a long line and
giving each person in it a fresh appraisal.  Groups have created other
groups who as groups have suffered grievances that now demand group
redress.  Public policy must reflect this historical reality.

Working Group</center>
<p> Bob -
</p>
<p>        I apologize for the long delay in sending you a few responses
on
your very interesting e-mail on primary tensions. My only excuse is the
usual one of being snowed under with daily demands and duties.  I don't
know what kinds of responses you have got from our colleagues, but I
would venture to guess that there have been few.  Welcome to the club of 
those whose brilliant e-mails sink in a sea of non-response.
</p><p>
        "Setting the rules in public life," I believe, is a variant of the
Hobbes-Burke political philosophy on the one side and the
Enlightenment-French Revolution ideal of democracy on the other. Never
resolvable if one argues the extremes of this dichotomy, and all of
political life in this country (and any other one that seriously aspires
to
be a democracy) is a constant, ever-renewed and never-stable compromise
between the two extremes.  That seems to be it. One of the interesting
social-science research questions which has always intrigued me, but which
I have never tackled myself, is to identify the conditions in which the
one legitimizing principle wins out (more or less) and the conditions in
which the other one wins out (more or less).  Analytic histories of the
court decisions  and of legislative acts, written from the perspective of
this struggle, would be most valuable.
</p><p>
        "Informing the citizens about public life" is a different sort of
tension, because, in my reading, those who argue the "all" pespective
generally tend to command more legitimacy than those who argue for
secrecy.  Think of the immediate suspicion that surrounds the idea of
executive privilege.  So this is a kind of "tilted" tension, with the
greater burden of proof resting on those who would withhold. But maybe
this is only the more recent version of the tension, and a longer-term
view would reveal a more balanced tension, or some kind of pendulum or
cyclical effect.  I am not certain that the "information" issue you lay
out in the first two paragraphs is to be mixed up with the "diversity"
issues, which falls more in the area of inequality and whose voice
should be heard (not just known) in the political process.  But maybe I
didn't get your point exactly right.
</p><p>
        I liked very much your third tension of equality before the law
(or social arrangements generally) and categorically-based constraints,
and agree that it is pervasive.  The ultimate test of this one (and the
most vexing for those who would argue for full equality) is the category
of 
age at
both ends of the life-cycle.  Despite the presence of vigorous social
movements on behalf of children and the elderly, it is always difficult to
mount a case that infants should be treated like everybody else, or that
the same consideration be given to those who are not capable of work or
social interaction on account of physical and mental deterioration. Maybe
you have a different kind of "equality" in mind.  The other interesting
case is that of criminals (a category imposed by society) whose equality
before the law has been temporarily (and presumably legitimately)
suspended.
</p><p>
        Idle thoughts, these, but since they occurred to me, I thought I
would pass them along.
</p><p>
