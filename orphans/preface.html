The Penn National Commission on Society, Culture and Community originated
out of a concern for the declining quality and effectiveness of public
discourse, the coarseness of so much of our public culture, and the
increasing separation and isolation of groups and individuals.
<p>
We believed that academic and professional leaders from a broad spectrum
of fields have a responsibility to bring their expertise and insights to
bear on such a situation.
<p>
As we discussed these problems during the Commissionï¿½s first meeting in
December 1996, we quickly came to a consensus that the surface
manifestations of incivility are certainly not a new phenomenon in
American history, and we concluded that they are, in fact, probably less
worrisome than the absence of a rich, more engaged, more honest, public
dialogue.
<p>
In the past, such an energetic discussion surrounded and contextualized
the same kinds of incivility and intolerance that now seem so dramatic.
So, in contrast to some of the other groups concerned with civility and
civic renewal, we have articulated our broadest objective as one of
creating <i>"a robust and diverse public culture in which reasoned and
reasonable discourse can flourish."</i>
<p>
That means we want to help stimulate an energetic and constructive public
discourse -- not throw a wet blanket on public expression in any of its
forms.
<p>
From that perspective, we quickly concluded that the incivility and
polarization of our contemporary public discourse are largely a symptom of
deeper social, economic, and political dynamics.  We recognized that,
among other factors, powerful market forces and governmental policies are
playing a significant role in shaping our public discourse and
interactions, often in quite negative ways.
<p>
At the Commission's second meeting in June 1997 in Philadelphia, we
examined these impacts and the ways in which they distort and polarize the
discussion of "hot-button" policy issues, such as affirmative action,
campaign reform, and immigration policy.
<p>

We identified three major factors that shape the context in which these
mass market and governmental forces operate.
<p>
We called these problems:  
<ul>
<li>	<b>The Culture of Intolerance, </b>referring to the pattern of
coarse and intolerant behavior that from time to time seems to dominate
every form of public interaction and behavior, from the floor of the House
of Representatives to talk radio or the behaviors of sports figures, or
corporate America.
<P>
<li>	<b>The Failure of Leadership,</b> alluding to the decline of
energetic public leadership in all walks of life, the tendency of leaders
to play it safe and follow their constituencies rather than offer them a
vision of alternative possibilities.
<P>
	<li><b>The Fragmenting of Communities, </b>the endless
sub-dividing and isolating of groups and individuals that seems intent on
making each person an island nation unto him or herself and destroying the
sense of shared community that we must have if we are to live together
happily and productively.
</ul>
<p>
As we discussed these problems in the context of real "hot-button" issues,
several themes emerged:
<p>
First, we concluded that it is possible and necessary to be proactive
about repairing our political and social systems -- to improve individual
behavior, to strengthen leadership, and to re-build communities.
<p>
Second, doing so requires a two-tiered approach:  on one level is the
conceptual and leadership task of articulating a vision of the "good
society" that has the power to engage citizens in the common effort to "do
better."
<p>
But while it is important to address the national -- and even
international -- dimensions of this problem and to envisage the good
society writ large, we must also address our efforts to local needs and
concerns. 
<p>
That is where some of the most important changes can occur.   We need to
"demonstrate" self-consciously, to "model" and "map," the ways of doing
better in order to show people what really is possible. 
<p>
To pursue these tasks, we established three working groups -- Culture and
Public Behavior, Leadership in a Democratic Society, and 21st Century
Community.  Each group is focused on one of these fundamental social
problems.  Each is charged with analyzing it and offering, for
consideration by the whole Commission, ideas that may help us all to think
and act differently about the important issues and choices we face every
day.
<p>
At its third meeting in December 1997 in Washington, DC, the Commission
continued with this essential task.  With the help of our keynote
speakers, we focused on ways in which major institutions in our society --
professional sports, colleges and universities, government, and the
military services -- can exert a more positive influence on public
behavior and the tenor of public discourse and culture.
<p>
In the electronic "pages" that follow, you have their reflections on the
important roles that professional sports, government, the military, and
universities can play in shaping the character of our public discourse and
public behavior.
<p>
Running throughout the Commission's discussions of Public Behavior,
Leadership and Community, is a central concern for the character of the
public conversation that binds us together.
<p>
Major institutions in our society play a powerful role in shaping that
conversation.  Among these, though often over-looked, is the modern
business corporation.  One of our originally scheduled speakers for the
Washington meeting was to have been the late CEO of Coca-Cola, Roberto
Goizueta.
<p>
Roberto -- whom I was proud to call a friend -- was one of those rare
corporate leaders who understood the capacity of leaders to change
institutional cultures.  His personal characteristics -- his warmth,
openness, and unfailing civility; his willingness to accept responsibility
for monumental blunders as well as enviable successes -- these deeply
influenced the corporate culture at Coca-Cola, an international network of
69,000 employees and 2.2 billion customers.
<p>
When he accepted public responsibility for the marketing fiasco caused by
modifying Coke's secret taste formula, Roberto Goizueta also seized upon
the opportunity to overcome the catastrophe by marketing Coke Classic.
Roberto set an example of creativity, courage, and civility that became
the model for his corporate employees.
<p>
"Selling flavored water?" I hear you thinking.  "Strange talk for a
university president."  But it is precisely thousands of such examples
that profoundly influence the tenor of our public culture.  Roberto
Goizueta understood this.  In a commencement address last spring at Loyola
University in Chicago, he spoke of the erosion of our society's civic
infrastructure.
<p>
More important, he recognized that businesses -- like other institutions
-- have a real stake in the issues we have convened to consider.  To those
with doubts, he pointed out that it was a reputation for poor customer
relations and lousy service that spawned the competition that toppled the
telephone monopoly.  The same thing is now happening in the cable
television industry.
<p>
Roberto saw clearly that "managing a business requires maximizing the
value of the company's assets, and a corporate culture of incivility and
intolerance thwarts the development of a company's most important asset,
its people."
<p>
He saw, too, that much as in academe, where our international disciplinary
communities may be our most important source of self-definition,
companionship, and communication, so too in the business world.  "Today,
for many of us," he wrote, "our company is the institution that most
defines our sense of community.  We may know the colleague we work with
side by side or one we E-mail in Europe, better than we know our neighbor
down the street."
<p>
The internal civility and robust discourse of the modern multi-national
corporation can contribute as much to the formation of a tolerant and
vibrant community for its employees and our society as the free-wheeling
exchanges on our campuses and disciplinary communities.  And creating such
a robust conversation is in no way incompatible with success in the
competitive world of business.  Under Goizueta's leadership, Coca-Cola was
transformed from a slow-footed, bureaucratic, conservatively managed U.S.
company into one of the greatest generators of shareholder wealth in
international corporate history.
<p>
Corporations are but one of the major institutions that have this power to
shape public culture and behavior.  I hope you will read and consider the
reflections below -- and use the online "conference" facility to share
your reactions. <p>
