Ms. CAROLYN LUKENSMEYER:  So the premise that we're taking is in all
of American history, one of the extraordinary foundations of our
democracy is small, face-to-face, authentic dialogue, the original New
England town hall meeting.  It has resonance.  It touches people's
spirit.  They have pride in it.  But the question becomes--or the
challenge becomes you can't just replicate that in communities all
over the country and hit the time cycle that the media demands or the
time cycle that a congressional process demands.
<p>
So how do you take that nugget, that learning that is done so well by many
different groups, and take what we have now been gifted with in the
information age, all kinds of technologies that the premise was could take
this to scale?  So this is the imagination.  Think of a map of the United
States, 10 cities--Boston, Winston-Salem, Tallahassee; Lexington, Kentucky;
Detroit, Minneapolis, St. Paul; Boise, Idaho; San Francisco; Albuquerque;
Denver.  In each of those cities, 200 demographically representative groups of
citizens recruited by ch--their choice, but held to the--keep--keep the
diversity that the community actually represents; the issue's Social Security,
so the diversity is age, income, gender and ethnicity.  Those of you know who
know Social Security policy, those are very, very critical questions.
<p>
Citizens meet on Friday night in their communities for two hours.  They are
highly facilitated--this is a primary lesson.  There has to be professional
facilitation skills available.  That's part of your chart.  We need an
enormous, massive influx of the capacity to do neutrally based, open-hearted,
open-minded dialogue.  That is not how we're taught to discourse, even in
schools these days.
<p>
So citizens develop their position on Social Security or the issue they most
care about having their national leaders hear about.  They reconvene on
Saturday for five hours, start with the president of the United States,
Republican leadership available to them all on interactive, two-way satellite
teleconferencing.  Start with--and your image of the hourglass is wonderful.
Part of where we are in this nation is people want that hourglass up-ended.
People want that hourglass for the people to be on the top and the politics to
be on the bottom.
<p>
In designing good citizen dialogue, you can do little bits of that, and you
can do it in a way that's totally respectful of the politicians.  The best
ones get it and want more of it.  It's part of how Bradley started trying to
run his campaign.  It's part of Hillary's listening process.  Some politicians
are getting:  `We should stop broadcasting.  We should listen.'
<p>
So the program was all 10 cities speak to the president and the Republican
leadership.  They have about a 20-minute dialogue.  Leaders gone.  We then
open up, via two-way satellite television, a two-hour and 45-minute
unscripted, spontaneous dialogue from citizens across these 10 cities.  I look
at Neal.  One of the biggest learnings I had was how bloody hard it is to find
an executive producer in television that will touch live television in 1999.
Thank God we found some.  But--so that--that took it to scale.  That was 2,000
citizens demographically representative.  We replicated this three times.  In
15 months, we did almost 50,000 Americans, every walk of life, that dedicated
six to eight hours of dialogue on Social Security.  We--I haven't told you
this story about how we did media and how we did polling.  We built up real
credibility in Congress.
<p>
So I know Mike will ask me this question if I don't say it at the front end:
What difference did all of this make?  There are four demonstrable outcomes in
the work we did that if the--you could take the advocates--the special
interest advocates, and if you have them on a panel, they would say exactly
what I'm about to say.  That could be Cato Institute.  That could be
Brookings, in terms of taking the liberal conservative.  Americans discussed
Social Security, and the way we did citizen engagement and did our polling
changed the debate on the revenue side of the options in Social Security.
Before we started in '98, there was no proposal on the table that had any
revenue enhancements in it--none.  Democrats wouldn't touch it because of the
way Republicans own tax cuts.
<p>
By the time we finished our work--and very quickly, about 11 weeks in, we had
an insight.  Almost 70 percent of the American public supports raising the cap
on the taxable wage base, and that is as true of Americans over $100,000 as it
is--conventional wisdom in Washington.  I was naive.  When I first went to
present this to Senate Finance and House and Ways, I got my head handed to me.
They, `Oh, right, that's a soak the witch--rich strategy.  Poor people want
rich people to do that.'  Not true.  It is across the board in income.
<p>
Second impact we had was we set a different standard for the kind of polling
that was done.  We all know the game in Washington.  News media are some of
the worst offenders of this.  They ask s--really, really irresponsible
questions to get a quick read.  We set a standard of push questions that were
asked on Social Security, and frankly, some of the advocacy groups just
stopped doing polling and used our question--used our polls, because people
understood they were neutral.
<p>
I should--one of the most important lessons out of this, if we're going to do
this on a national level, is whoever sponsors these dialogues, both from the
citizens' point of view and from the Congress' point of view, has to be an
honest neutral broker.  There probably was a day in American democracy when
government was the honest neutral broker who could pull all the parties to the
table, but that day is gone.
<p>
So wh--whether it was Congress or citizens, one of the lessons out of this is
absolute neutrality.  ADSS said from the beginning, `We will never take a
position on this issue.'  It was a huge risk on our part.  Didn't know if
anyone in Congress would listen.  Turned out to be our largest asset.
<p>
The other impact I want to describe that's like M--Mary was just saying,
because we often use the wrong standards to evaluate this.  One of the impacts
that will probably get no visibility, but I personally think is the most
imp--one of the most important things we did, 22 members of Congress took what
we did seriously enough that they will never run a town hall meeting again the
way they had been trained to run them.  The way they'd been trained to run
them is all experts up front, auditorium style, two mics; just like we're
going to do to you today, panel takes 80 percent of the time, audience gets 20
percent of the time, and at best, what they get is a little Q&A.
<p>
Again, we upended the design, the architecture, room level playing field,
round tables, citizens; congressman travels from table to table, has trained
facilitators, listens to the input and then gives his or her summary and
reaction rather than broadcasting at citizens.  I think that's an incredibly
important outcome.
<p>
JAY:  You have to wind it up.
<p>
Ms. LUKENSMEYER:  There's some others if they come up in questions.  The key
learnings, beyond the couple that I said.  A couple myths that I think ca--can
just so easily have been exploded, and if you listened carefully, Martha and
Mary both said this already, but I'll say it again.  It is nonsense that
American citizens are apathy--apathetic about the policy issues that impact
their daily lives.  They're not invited in, in a way that means anything in
their judgment.  We did 50,000 people.  I mean, think about that.  And it was
just a broad outreach to communities, and it wasn't busloads of people from
AARP or busloads of people from labor.  It was average Americans who cared
about the issue.  So it is--we are--any time we excuse ourselves by saying,
`This isn't happening in America because Americans are apathetic,' we're
putting the challenge on the wrong side of the agenda.  We are not designing,
we are not structuring, and we are not linking to the institutional fabric
that makes the decision.
<p>
I've segued into second:  Don't start these dialogues unless they have respect
and link to the people who make the decisions at the front end.  We've gone so
far in America around the cynicism and skepticism that we do people a
disservice to once more invite them to the table to talk unless there's a link
to people who can do something about it.  So one of the huge challenges
here--and I hope this becomes part of the public talk--is increasing the
readiness in our institutional fabric--its universities, its corporations, its
the--institutional church--to take seriously citizen voice.  And that is as
much true as it is government and the media.
<p>
I look at Kathleen.  A real surprising learning to me out of this process of
listening to literally tens of thousands of citizens for 18 months, citizens
at this moment in time in this country feel more disempowered about the media
than they feel disempowered about government.  And that--there's a depth to
that.  When you listen to them carefully, that is very important to help
retrain them; that you can call your local television station, you can put
demands on a--the way the newspaper covers school issues.  They do not believe
that, and they do not believe that even more than they believe it about
government.
<p>
JAY:  OK.
<p>
Ms. LUKENSMEYER:  One other lesson and then I know I have to...
<p>
JAY:  You have to wind it up.
<p>
Ms. LUKENSMEYER:  O--one other lesson.  Another what I would call myth is that
good dialogue does not make good television.  It doesn't make plot.  It'll
never be commercial.  It'll never be entertainment.  But I can give you the
case studies in at least five states that have sophisticated television
networks.  Wash--WTV in the state of Washington's the most impressive.  They
did our 750-person event, six hours live, all day long.  In our e-mail and
voice-mail, we had 1,000 requests for information as a result of people who
watched television that day.  There is a way to do it.  It takes a real
combination of excellent live work that has a human element to it and good
produced television in coordination, but it can be done.  Thank you.
<p>
JAY:  Thank you, Carolyn.  Bob McKenzie.
<p>
Mr. ROBERT McKENZIE:  Thank you, Jay.  I want to say amen, amen, amen.  There
are some differences of emphasis in our work, some points where one of us is a
little ahead of the other, perhaps, i--in what we're thinking about along the
same scheme, but basically everything's been said, I have nothing to say but
amen.
<p>
Let me say some things that maybe take a little bit different--give u--give us
something else to think about.  I need to say this about the Kettering
Foundation that I work for.  We are a research foundation, and our single
research question is:  What does it take to make democracy work?  All of our
effort is engaged on that.
<p>
Let me say just a little bit about what deliberation is.  We talk generally
about political discourse, but I use the term's in--specific meaning.
Deliberation is a mode of discourse that is necessary to deal with differences
of conviction, not mere differences of interest.  It is a mode of discourse
for making a decision together.  I use the word `dialogue' to mean a mode of
discourse for increasing understanding, but not necessarily making a decision,
and I think that's a point you need to catch.  And the difference between what
Jane was talking about and what Martha and Carolyn and I a--tend to talk
about, most of our research is focused on deliberation, although we're
learning more and more that there are areas where dialogue is what you really
need to--to be aimed at, and--and the principle that Jane enunciated needs to
be kept in mind.
<p>
I am going to, as I go through these quick remarks, give you the download
links to the material at the back.  I'll just hold up something that you can
go back there and get and get more information, but you can get this for more
information about the Kettering Foundation; this, too, for more information
about the Kettering Foundation.  For NIF, there's a little-bitty pamphlet.
There are some examples of issue books for display only if you want to look at
those.
<p>
Now let me say a word about the public policy institutes, because we--we think
that is our effort to address a concern the PNC had in the advance reading
material about the need for aggressive development of convenient moderating
skills.  And the points that Carolyn, Jane and Martha made are absolutely
right on about ne--neutrality and structure and--and all of that and the
context and the architecture of the room and all of that kind of thing.  If
you want to know more about the public policy institutes, pick up this
publication.  Most of the tw--current 27 are on campuses of institutions of
higher education, but not all of them.  One of them is right across the
street, Harris Sokoloff at UPenn doing some amazing work.  I was over there
talking with him this morning about the next step in their Citizens Agenda
work with The Inquirer and framing of issues.
<p>
OK.  What did we learn?  There are some things that--that we just have to keep
reminding ourselves.  These are not new learnings, but they're important to
keep in your mind as you do this work.  What does it take to make democracy
work as it should?  It takes citizens who know how to make hard choices
together.  That's mo--mostly what we've been talking about here.  It takes a
strong civil society.  It takes, within that civil society, institutions that
have the trust and respect of the citizens, and--and that's a real work
problem.  That's where Jay and I have come together i--our acquaintance has
been around that question as it relates to the--to the journalism profession.
<p>
We have to recognize and keep reminding ourselves in our work that
deliberative democracy is a recessive gene in the political makeup.  It is
easily overpowered by other ways of thinking about politics.  But it's vital
to our overall enduring political health, and those of us who are in this work
stay at it even though we know we're swimming upstream.
<p>
Citizens--another thing we have to remember is that citizens, as a public in a
democracy, have responsibilities that can be delegated to no one else.  Y'all
all recognize that as political science theory, but it's important to remember
democracy requires citizens, and we have to build citizens.  We also need to
remember that deliberation is a natural act.  We do it all the time, to make
decisions as individuals and in small groups about choices.  If we all decided
we want to go out to eat together to--this afternoon--this evening, we would
work through the pulls and tugs among things we value in life:  cost, access
and quality, which happen to be the same things you have to struggle with on
health care.  So it's--it's there, it's natural, we can do it, but we tend to
forget that we know how to do that when we get into--into what we think is
politics.
<p>
Now what have we learned?  Anyone can deliberate.  It doesn't depend upon
level of factual expertise, which is something we academics need to remember.
We're talking about facts, plus knowledge here; the--the meaning of facts in
the context of what people hold valuable, and people are experts on what they
hold valuable.  Part of the framing is getting into that and tapping
into--into that connection.  Deliberation can occur at multiple scales.  Most
of the forums and study circles that--that I know of are less than 50 people,
as David points out in his research, but I've been in a number of forums up
into the hundreds.  And communities can have numerous overlapping forums that
involve larger numbers of the population, so it's not just a small group
dynamic.
<p>
And the only distinction between what Martha and--not the only, but probably
the major distinction between what Martha and I do is that she's emphasizing
study circles, repetitive getting together.  When I use the word `forums,'
we're talking about one-time events, but we also have people who...
(technical difficulties) ...agree with one another.  Unless you work hard at
what Martha works hard at, it's keeping that open and keeping it connected.
Forums, if--if developed well, can have an impressive demographic range in
people coming together, and--and you were giving examples of that.  Of course,
y'all di--y'all structured that somewhat.
<p>
And--OK, deliberation builds an engaged public, and there are kinds of issues
that require an engaged pudgic--public.  The issues that bedevil us--poverty,
racism, educational failure, crime, the wad of concerns around environment
land use, economic development, health in its broadest context--issues of that
sort are systemic.  They are not one time.  They are not one jurisdiction.
They are multiple locusts of--of--of--of trying to deal with them.  Some of
the literature in t--in--refers to them as wicked problems, not in the moral
sense, but in the sense that y--that you can't know when you solve that.  I
mean, getting to the moon is a complex problem, but we know when we got there.
Poverty, racism and crime are different, and--and they are different in that
the very definition of the problem is part of the problem.  Is poverty, for
example, caused by failure of moral character, or is it h--environmental
factors or what is it?  It's--it's the assumption you make about the problem
going in that's part of the problem to be discussed.
<p>
There is a logic of deliberative democracy can--that can address these kinds
of issues.  That is laid out in--in this publication.  Very simply, it's:  In
order to act together, people have to choose together.  There are powerful
educational implications in that--in that simple sentence.  In order to choose
together, they have to think together.  In order to think together, they have
to talk together.  And in order to talk together about differences of
conviction, they have to deliberate.  In order to deliberate, we've learned
that they have to have certain things, and I may throw in a couple of things
that have already been said.  But they have to have public space, not only
physical space but emotional and intellectual space to do their work.  They
have to have issues framed in terms relative to what they consider valuable,
and that's the point Carolyn made.
<p>
And I think in our work, that may be where we're a little ahead of some of the
other efforts in this, because we've put a lot of thought into what--how do
you frame the issue?  That's the quintessential political act, and that's what
Harris is working on across the street.  That's what a lot of our public
policy institutes work with.  It means framing issues in terms relative to
what the people consider valuable, and that's not in a polarized fashion, and
it's not in an ideological fashion.  We think that is addressing the point
that was brought up yesterday morning about the hole in framing the middle
ground.  Jay made that point, but we are doing more and more work in that
area.
<p>
And they need guidelines for deliberation that allow people to learn together
about all perspectives on a problem so that they can weigh strengths,
weaknesses, cost and tradeoffs, and--and there's an art and a science to that.
Here's a publication on convening and moderating, emphasizing neutrality and
the other things.
<p>
Another thing we've learned is that deliberation produces public knowledge
that can be obtained in no other way.  I'm going to use our language here, and
maybe we'll have time to develop it, but it--it reveals what people are
thinking, not just what they think.  It reveals the struggle among the
tradeoffs, not just where I am on this question, that question, this question.
And we've learned that public knowledge of that sort is particularly valuable
to officeholders at critical points.  And we're on--on the--in a nationwide
search for officeholders who have some way of seeing the public a little
differently than most do to see whether there's some connection there that we
can work on.
<p>
At its best--I'm not saying the NIF does this all the time or that every forum
or study circle does this, but at its best, NIF makes--and I'm quoting
you--"national conversation localized, less abstract and more relevant.  NIF
makes service learning, both academic and civic."  I could tell you s--stories
about that.  "NIF opens up a classroom and makes it a discourse community."  I
can tell you a lot of stories about that from my teaching days.  Now we're
exploring:  What can it do for a campus?  And here's a publication you might
want to look at.  Here's another publication you might want to look at back
there.
<p>
What difference does it make?  The--the summaries of the--what we've learned
each year go into something called NIF Reports, which is a publication that
tries to pull it together.  We, too, are invited up to the Hill and--and
to--to comment on--on what we're seeing about what the public is thinking.
NIF makes relationship building part of decision-making.  Those are not a step
one, step two kind of thing.  If you could experience the dynamics of what
goes on in a forum or a good study circle or in the work Jane, Carolyn and I
do, I think you can see both of those things happening.  As people work toward
a decision, they are building relationships with one another.  And our
moderators are taught to move the conversation toward a decision, and that is
the common task concern that y'all had.
<p>
JAY:  Bob, we have to wind it up.
<p>
Mr. McKENZIE:  OK.  I've got one last point.  And--and I want to make it last
because I want you to remember it.  You know, the mind is a wonderful thing.
It can be anywhere, but I'm hoping our minds and bodies are in the same place
at this point.  It's the political assumption you make about the work, and
I've learned to ask people--they probably won't answer me honestly, but I say,
`How do you view the public?  Do you view the public as something that has to
be educated or, even with the best of intentions, manipulated?  Or do you see
the public as a source of vital information for addressing an issue that
requires public engagement, and do you see them as the primary actors in how
that's going to be done?'  I mean, who's going to solve poverty, racism and
educational failure, crime and so forth?  Thank you, Jay.
<p>
JAY:  Thank you, Bob.  Well, there you have it, the base of the triangle;
meaning people, while working on the ground with citizens, trying to create
better public discourse, and then somehow they are moving not only in their
programs, but in their thought upward toward the general claim for
deliberation and citizen engagement that we can make as philosophers and
writers and academics.
<p>
So the heart of what we heard in their lessons are certain midrange principles
that get you from a generalized desire for better public discourse down to
what actually happens at communities and in real live citizen conversations?
They have a set of midrange principles for us from that work, and I think
they're extremely important for that reason.
<p>
David, on the far right of--of the table, looked at what they did in the
context of the commission's work overall, which is what his 1999 paper is
about and why it's been referred to so often here.  So I want to just ask him
to reflect on what he heard for the work of the commission based on the
attempt to sketch an architecture d--in your paper.
<p>
Mr. DAVID RYFE:  Thank you.  I'll just take a very few minutes because these
people are the experts.  They've been doing this for a very long time, and you
should have an opportunity to have a conversation with them.  So I'll just
take a--a couple of minutes.
<p>
But one thing I would say at the outset, in response, again, to Steve's
presentation yesterday, is that the commission doesn't have to create a
movement.  A movement already exists.  It exists in Jay's public journalism
initiative.  It exists in Fishkin's deliberative polling.  It exists in all
the range of activities that the panel is participating in.  It's happening
already.  Perhaps the commission might be better served, instead of trying to
create a movement, to facilitate one that's already being developed, to
catalyze, perhaps provide some structure to what is often--may w--several of
these people, all of whom have been doing the same kinds of work, haven't met
one another before--bringing people together.
<p>
And I would also--i--i--if the commission's work is going to be rooted in the
university, you might think about what kinds of unique resources a university
has, particularly the research of its faculty, which, after all, a research
one university--that's what it does.  It produces research--what kinds of
resources it has to add value to what these individuals are doing.  So
that--that's an initial comment.
<p>
One of the things I heard here and I hope that you heard is a kind of
commonsense convin--common sense about public discourse that we often ignore,
at least academics who study public discourse ignore, and that is different
kinds of discourse will be effective in different contexts.  Now, of course,
that implies that we know something about what kinds of discourse will work in
what contexts, and, unfortunately, we don't know much about that because there
hasn't been a rigorous evaluation of these efforts.
<p>
The NIF's, as far as I know, are one of the oldest continuing discourse
programs in the country.  They've been going on since 1982.  Most of these
other initiatives have been going on only since the 1990s.  So there really
hasn't been--and they've become very successful in that time period, but there
really hasn't been a movement, especially within the academy, to take a look
at these programs and to see what they're actually doing.
<p>
There has been a few studies, and most of those studies are attitudinal
studies.  They give a survey at the beginning of a conversation.  What do you
think about these issues?  And then they give a survey of the participants at
the end of this conversation.  What do you think of these issues?  And if they
can measure some change, they publicize that.  The conversation must have had
some effect in their attitudes.  And that's certainly one issue that we'd like
to think about, but I think that there are a lot of other issues that can be
investigated, and this--in some ways, I hesitate to broadcast this, but this
is a wide-open field, and I kind of want to keep it to myself now that I've
discovered it.  But--but, really, evaluation is a re--a wide-open field.
There hasn't been a lot of work in this area, and--and there needs to be.
<p>
Now let me continue on with that thought by thinking through one hypothesis
that might be--that might be investigated.  One of the things I noticed in my
observations about these programs, in relation to the principles of public
discourse that I outlined in--in the literary review that you read last
year, was that relational sorts of public discourse principles--by that, I
mean things like moderation, reciprocity, speaking from one's own individual
experience--these kinds of principles seem to be most appropriate or most used
in smaller groups--sometimes very small groups, five people--and also groups
that tend to be interested in the goal of educating their members or resolving
some conflict, in Mary's case.  They don't tend to be used so much or at least
tend to be stressed so much in groups that are larger and in groups that
are--that tend to be oriented to taking some action.
<p>
And, of course, the group that best epitomizes that is Congress.  Congress is
a very large group.  It's dedicated to taking action.  That's the one place in
this country where you will not find good principles of public discourse.  On
the other hand, larger groups and groups oriented to action tend to express
rational kinds of principles.  They want reasoned arguments.  They want policy
statements.  They want substantive kinds of deliberations.  There's an
assumption in these groups that pe--participants share enough already among
themselves as a kind of community that they can skip over or go lightly over
that aspect of community building or relationship building.  So there's not
much effort in these kinds of groups to do that kind of thing.
<p>
Now there seems to be an implicit assumption among these groups that larger
groups tend to have faci--promote these kind of pri--principles and smaller
groups tend to have these kinds of principles attached to them.  And my
question is:  Is that true?  Is it true that larger groups couldn't be better
served by doing some very intensive relationship-building exercises?  Is it
true that smaller groups couldn't be served by providing more of a substantive
rationally-oriented or reason-oriented kind of engagement?
<p>
One of the ironies here I hope you catch or at least that I caught is that the
more people are required to take action, the less they tend to embrace the
kinds of principles of good public discourse currently being promoted in the
scholarly literature.  Right?  So the kinds of principles scholars are
promoting are not the kinds of principles which appear to be used most by
groups oriented to taking some kind of action.
<p>
So I can imagine an evaluative study, for instance--and these kinds of
distinctions can't be grasped, I think, in a--in a--in a survey kind of study,
but I could see a comparative ethnography, for instance, where we go into a
study circle's resource center and live there for a while, and we go into a
National Issues Forum and live there for a while and see not only what people
think, i--in your terms, Bob, but how they're thinking.  You know, that kind
of subtlety requires that kind of detailed field work.  Of course, we don't
have anything like that.  And, in fact, I think the study circles is doing
something like that right now, the fi--the only program that I found that's
doing something like that.  But something like that could be done.
<p>
We could do discursive analyses of interactions to find out, well, you know,
our goals are these.  Are those goals being fostered within the structure of
the forum itself?  That kind of research could be done.  So that's all I'll
say about evaluation.  It needs to be done, and there are lots of different
ways of doing it.
<p>
Let me just make a couple of other points for you to think about.  One is one
of the things that I also learned in studying these groups is that, by and
large--and this is something that came up in our last conversation in
December--most of these groups do not reach that--and you can choose your
number--20 percent to 40 percent of the population which are very apathetic
toward public life, which simply refuse to participate in public life, refuse
to vote, refuse to go to libraries or public institutions; really have no
access to the institutions of public life.
<p>
What they are included--generally they're included in the form of a
representative sample.  You have to physically go out there and find these
people.  And Fishkin has a great story in his book where he describes having
to take someone from their home, drive them to the airport, fly them to Texas
to be involved in this forum because, otherwise, she would never have gone to
this deliberative poll because she'd never been on an airplane.
<p>
Unfortunately, most of this quarter of the population which is apathetic tends
to be working class, tends to be poor.  A heavy proportion of these people are
people of color.  And it's a problem.  If we think deliberation is--at least
one aspect of deliberation is inclusion, we're not including a quarter of the
population, even with these heroic efforts that are being done in this--in
this field.
<p>
JAY:  Give us one more point, David, and we'll try and talk a little.
<p>
Mr. RYFE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  OK.  And--and one thing--one final thing is don't
underestimate the problem of reconciling deliberation with the
represen--representative system.  I think that there's actually two different
logics at work there.  Deliberation assumes that people will come together in
a reasoned conversation or at least a conversation and come to some judgment
about an issue and that action will be taken on that issue.
Representational--representational politics is not deliberative politics.
It's coalitional politics.  It's group building.  People get elected in
national politics by cobbling together different constituencies and serving
those constituencies when they get into office.  They don't get into office by
being able to deliberate very well, right?
<p>
So Social Security reform--and so likely what happens on Social Security is
going to be an outcome of group politics, not deliberative politics.  So
there's a real big disconnect between the two kinds of logics, and i--I--I
don't for a minute want to--want you to think that that disconnect can't be
overcome, but I--I do want you to be aware that it is a problem.  And I think
they've all addressed this problem in various ways, and it's something the
commission should think about in trying to formulate new kinds of forums or
new expressions of this linkage between the two logics.  OK.  I'll end there.
Thank you.
<p>
JAY:  Thank you.  Just one second.  Here's what I think we heard.  Our
question is:  How do you create more robust public discourse?  Their answer
is, create counterfactual conditions for public discourse:  a study circle, a
common ground forum, a National Issues Forum, an America speaks forum; create
counterfactical--factual conditions for public discourse and draw people to
them.  Draw people to them.  Whatever it takes to hold those people and give
them an authentic democratic experience is what you need to create more robust
public discourse.  That's how they operate.  It's pragmatism, classic
pragmatism, and the learning involved in creating better public discourse.
That's why what--their experience matters.
<p>
Now you have questions about why it matters.  Kathleen, why don't we start
with you?
<p>
Ms. KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON:  I just wanted to add something to--to Robert's
discussion of the Philadelphia compact process that Harra So--Harris Sokoloff
worked with that was called Citizen Voices, because we--we did do an
evaluation of that process, and I think it was instructive.  That process had
The Inquirer drawing in an elite population through its op-ed page.  We drew
together a random sample of Philadelphians to deliberate with the elite
population.  We measured their capacity to deliberate across three different
deliberative moments.  In the first moment, we noticed--we noticed s--really
serious differences between what the two groups were doing, and the
first--the--the elite group was giving arguments with evidence, was
acknowledging the other side, was counterarguing.
<p>
By the third meeting in which these groups are deliberating, there is no
difference on those three measures between the two groups.  You cannot
distinguish the elites from the random sample controlling for education and
controlling for income.  And what we saw that at--as was evidence that the
norm of deliberation is strong enough that, given the opportunity to be part
of it, people, regardless of their educational capacity, educational
backgrounds, have the capacity to deliberate, and I think Robert's making a
very important point when he makes that point.
<p>
Secondly, when--when we talk about Congress as not an institution that has
strong deliberative norms, I worry that what we are doing is, in fact,
representing our view of Congress as we see it through the press instead of
Congress as we would see it if we watched Congress.  I think that what
Congress has done is put in place, largely because of Thomas Jefferson's
manuals, almost a--an ideal set of rules that we could all use in
deliberating.  I mean, they--they are rules that are set up to minimize the
likelihood that you engage in what they call personalities, what we would call
attacking the person instead of attacking the position.
<p>
There's almost a ballet that--that is the institutional structure for the
taking-down process, which is a s--a set of strategic moves designed to
de-escalate and to move toward conciliation.  And the rules over time have
developed very clear standards that say that you may not impugn the integrity
of another person.  Indeed, it yields an automatic taking-down process.  And I
think if--if we took those rules, what we would find is that all of these
groups have basically reproduced those rules.  But Congress reproduced them
earlier because Congress has been around longer.
<p>
JAY:  Thank you for that, Kathleen.  Bob.
<p>
Mr. ROBERT WIEBE:  Although I--I may not be talking to Mary's point, I think,
even implicitly, what I have to say deals with her also.  But, otherwise, all
the participants, it seems to me, are working with a need that nobody
expresses, and that is a radical--and I mean radical--decentralization of
decision-making.  Until it is that need for the people entering political
life, to know that what they do has some bearing on an outcome, that is that
critical first step.  They won't come in if there isn't a payoff in outcome.
<p>
Well, for most of the issues that we deal with, the outcome is determined, or
the framework within which that outcome can be made, is so tightly constrained
well beyond where they're operating that unless you--and I mean
radically--unless you radically decentralize decisions, I'm not quite sure
h--what--you know, I g--yes, I--I want to hear from--from you because I
believe what you say, but I also believe in that radical decentralization of
institutions other than the governing institutions, and that's where it seems
to me what Mary says applies, too; that organizations operate in that same
fashion.  And without that decentralization, then the participants won't feel
they can even affect their organizations.
<p>
JAY:  All right.  Let me ask you, Carolyn, how much decentralization of
decision-making and power is involved for the model of the bottom-up
conversation to work?
<p>
Ms. LUKENSMEYER:  I want to do two tracks.  I--this was a--it's very
interesting to me.  Most times in sessions like this when I present, people
jump to a conclusion that, therefore, this work all will let--lead toward
direct democracy.  And, therefore, a version of that is radical
decentralization.
<p>
In my experience of listening carefully in this process for five years now,
most Americans still fundamentally believe in our system enough that they're
not demanding a total change in structure in order to participate, but they
have to see an impact or an influence of their work.  So--and I agree with you
wholeheartedly that many, many public policy issues you can't make that
connection, which is why I said if you're going to do this nationally, you
should be very careful which issues you pick.
<p>
But I don't--I think this connecting Citizen Voice from the bottom up to the
way Congress--because that's the venue we're in in this conversation--works,
people will suspend their disbelief if they see that Bill Archer, the chairman
of House Ways and Means, is gonna actually take in this data and use it; if
they see that the same is gonna happen to the Senate Finance Committee.  So
there's still that much--it's a leap of faith they make past a certain point.
<p>
But there's a second track and I--this comes back to something Tom Luce said
this morning; it comes back to something Mary said and, Judith, you expressed
a great interest in.  When we started our work, we actually did worldwide
research in terms of what our new mediating mechanisms that have come on the
scene in the last decades that will deal with decision-making made at a
different level.  And there are two I want to share the story with, and then
I'll quit.
<p>
I found only one in the United States.  It's called the North Dakota Consensus
Council.  It's now being repre--rep--replicated in Montana, and a couple of
other states are looking at it.  The governor of North Dakota, at a certain
point, recognized that in the tough land-use environmental water-rights
issues, there was no way the government leadership could come to a
meaningful--whether it was coalition politics, consensus--they just couldn't
do it.  He convinced the speaker and the Senate leaders to create this other
standing entity, which they have a formula then for how you are pointed to
this, and that body now stands that any entity--a citizen, a corporation, a
government agency--can bring the issue to the Consensus Council.  They're
using all range of deliberative techniques:  alternative dispute resolution,
consensus deliberation.  And the parties that bring it sign a contract when
they bring it that they will fully participate in the designed process and
they will abide by the outcome.
<p>
Now--and I--I--I'm right where Tom Luce is.  This country--I believe
nationally that we're going to have to find some other mechanisms like this
that create an intervening level of where decisions get made.
<p>
The other one, I'll just say it briefly, but this body should know about it,
is something called the Danish Technology Board.  It's a very oddly named
entity.  But the Danish Parliament actually has given this body a role, and
the method they use is like citizen juries that Ned Crosby established in this
country at the Jefferson Center in Minnesota.  The one I observed closely,
personally was biogenetic engineering.  So this is not--this is not taking on
a small issues.  The parliament had done some deliberation about it.  They'd
had all kinds of expert panel input into committees.  They then did one of
these citizen panels, and the parliament commits that when they ask a panel to
operate--and it's just ordinary citizens picked to represent the Danish
population--when it deliberates, the answer that comes out is then taken into
the Danish Parliament for another round of open public deliberation in the
parliament.
<p>
Now that--we're not--we don't have any mechanism like that.  What I've heard
citizens ask for--that I think gets at your question--is:  Why couldn't we--to
me this is one very practical suggestion--why we couldn't take on a four-year
presidential election cycle, let the public select the issue, whatever it
might be?  In 1992, it definitely would have been health care, OK?  I don't
know what it would be in 2000.  Let the public pick one issue that they want
Congress and the executive branch to work on, but they want an ahead-of-time
agreement that it's not done in the bipartisan committee structure; that it is
in some way done on a track that is a collaborative effort between both
parties and a collaborative effort between the executive branch and the
Congress differently than we've come to lose confidence in the rancor that now
does exist in Congress despite their civil rules.
<p>
JAY:  Well, we have to go on...
<p>
Ms. LUKENSMEYER:  Sorry.
<p>
JAY:  ...but that is a fairly utopian idea that would be interesting to
develop.  Edna.
<p>
Unidentified Man:  Martha was...
<p>
JAY:  Oh, I'm sorry, Martha.
<p>
MARTHA:  Yeah.  I just want to add one thing to that.  I think that, Bob, part
of what we're dealing with here is the--the assessment that people know that
they can really make some change at the local level.  And even that can be
very radical when there's bias, as Carolyn sug--suggested, from local
leadership in the very beginning in sponsoring this in a commitment to living
up to what people deliberate on at the local level.  It can make a real
difference.  And it's not to suggest that national policy doesn't set a lot of
constraints on that, but I think it's a beginning.  And I also think it's a
connection between the volunteerism that people have been talking about and
the strengthening of represent--representative institutions people have been
trying to do.  This is a sort of medium ground of trying to strengthen
deliberative democracy at the local level as a step toward strengthening
national deliberative democracy.
<p>
JAY:  I think we have time for one more question.  Edna.
<p>
EDNA:  Yeah.  Let--let me first preface by saying that while the morning
session was fascinating, this I find really gratifying.  And I'm very thankful
to--to all the members, panelists, who--who--who described their work to us.
I'm really--I'm very impressed and--and touched by a lot of what I hear.
<p>
I want to focus on Mary's work because she deals with a divisive issue and
maybe the most divisive issue in this country.  And I come from a society
which is extremely divided; I come from Israel.  And we've had for at least 30
years now a--one big divisive issue that just tears the country apart.  And
problems of bridging that or dealing with that are very much a daily problem
for every citizen in this country.
<p>
Now I f--I have for a while thought:  Why is American politics different, and
is there anything comparable to our problem about the territories?  And the
only one I could come up with was this abortion debate that maybe comes
closest to being as divisive.  Now there is this book by Dworkin that you may
be familiar with, "Life's Dominion," where he actually tackles that.  And
he--his solution there or the way he sees it is we have two opposing positions
and maybe there is a middle ground, and he finds the middle ground in the
concept that he calls sanctity of life.  And he wants to say each side of the
divide believes in the sanctity of life, but interprets it differently.  Once
people see that there is some principle that they both adhere to, maybe the
division will grow--will dissipate or grow less.
<p>
And I d--don't think it works.  I think maybe it's a--it's a very interesting
theoretical book and theoretical work.  I doubt that it has any kind of
practical working.  And I can find, frankly, a kind of common principle that
both those--that the people who wants to return territories, those on the left
in Israel, and those who want to retain the territories, those on the right,
can agree that they both are thinking in terms of the--securing the future of
Israeli or something like, you know, Israel's future existence.  Both of them
are concerned with that, and each side to the divide believes that their way
of doing it is the only way to secure that principle.  So having a common
principle that both sides can agree to sounds nice, but it doesn't solve the
problem of the division.
<p>
And, frankly, I--I want to draw you out to a little bit more about the point
of your dialogue, because I wasn't sure I was getting it.  Is it that people
come to your table, that they change their view?  Is it the idea that they
will change their initial view on abortion?  Is it only that they will learn
not to demonize the other side, just to recognize that there is this other
position and it's really people who are holding it and we don't want
necessarily to kill them for that?  Or what is it that--when you are dealing
with these dialogues, what is the end result, and--and can you try to draw
some kind of an analogy or a lesson to, you know, a society like ours w--with
such a divisive issue?
<p>
Ms. JACKSTEIT:  The fir--the part that's easy to answer is, no, it isn't about
changing your position on abortion.  I think the qu--the easiest way to answer
it is that what it's about is building--is community building or community
sustaining or community resurrecting, in a sense.  How do you live in
community which may be your town, your state or your nation in the presence of
an irresolvable conflict?  That's really what it's about, if you ask me,
because at the core of the issue is an irresolvable conflict.
<p>
Now around it are many things that are resolvable.  How do you reduce the
incident?  How do you reduce the--the--the situations that call for abortion?
How do you reduce teen-age pregnancy?  How do you reduce the tension between
work and family?  And there's all kinds of things around that you can parse
out that are things that can be worked on and solved and deliberated and
problem solved around.  But at the core, there's an irreduc--ducible core of
conflict.
<p>
How do you live together with that?  I mean, that--that--essentially, it's to
enable people to--to see a way of living with that conflict.  That does not
mean they never talk about anything.  They never work o--with each other about
anything.  They disrupt each other's deliberative processes.  You hold things
hostage, like in Congress where you attach abortion, you know, provisions to
unrelated bills that might be important, like the UN dues or whatever.  You
know, how do you--how do you co-exist with this conflict?  How do you not
dehumanize people?  How do you--which can lead to violence, but then also lead
to election cycles where the abortion issue is used as a club?
<p>
I mean, it--the discussion about how Governor Bush de--de--in a sense, defused
the abortion issue by co--by acknowledging the complexity of it instead of
treating it simplistically.  It's how do you live with an--with an irreducible
conflict in--in your society where to polarize--to allow it to polarize
and--and, in a sense, warp your democratic process?  You may feel that's
unacceptable.
<p>
The fact that the activity about it is in local communities more than
nationally is for a very good reason.  In local communities, people live with
their adversaries.  I mean, two famous Common Grounders had their children on
the same soccer team.  She ran a big clinic.  He was a big pro-life lawyer.
But they saw each other.  They were much more aware of the actual cost of
their being e--being enemies.  They can't work together on, you know, another
job.  They couldn't work together on refugees because, you know, they hate
each other about abortion.  So it's how you live with an irreducible conflict,
how do you build sustained community in a democratic process when you can't
resolve one key part of it.
<p>
Now how you extrapolate that to--to Israel, I don't know, though Search for
Common Ground is one of the few organizations where, you know, the abortion
r--the--the abortion conflict project is right next to the Middle East
project, so we talk about that.  But part of it is co-existence, and there's a
part of the Middle East project that is called Images of the Other, which has
to do with breaking down the--the polarized and stereotype images between
Palestinians and Israelis.  So the similar--there are similarities about just
the--here's the reality, folks.  You live in the same place.  That's what I
say to pro-life people.  Yeah.
<p>
JAY:  Unfortunately, we're out of time.
<p>
Ms. JACKSTEIT:  I'm sorry.
<p>
JAY:  Thank you, Mary.  Well, I think we saw that the upside-down triangle
worked.  We provided a very different perspective from the ground up toward
better public discourse.  There's no way to understand what our participants
have said to us if we think of it as a solution to the problem.  It could only
be understood if--if we're willing to call it an experiment, which is a
different way of thinking and a different way of knowing.
<p>
Similarly, there's no way of understanding what they're trying to do within
the tradition of realism and political science and social thought that's come
down to us in the university in the 20th century.  It's not an exercise in
that discourse.  It's pragmatic.  It's pragmatic.  It's about experimenting
with different solutions to an endemic and long-term problem and trying to
learn from there, some of which involve creating ideal conditions for
discourse in order to learn how to make them real.  That's not realism.  It's
a different intellectual impulse.  Or the realism comes second, right?
<p>
Unidentified Man:  It's a...
<p>
JAY:  What you experiment with.  So that--to me as a scholar, that's what's
exciting about this.  For me, as somebody in the civic renewal movement
myself, it's great 'cause I know these people--I--I just met Mary.  I--I've
known the others for many years, and I see them in many different settings
talking about their work.  And I know how important it is.
<p>
In fact, just last summer Martha and Carolyn and I were together at Aspen at a
very similar conference talking about similar issues.  And while, Judith,
Philadelphia is wonderful, it--it's not Aspen.  So if there's a renewal of
this great group after we've created more robust public discourse, it ought to
be at Aspen.
<p>
Thank you very much for your attention.
<p>
Unidentified Man:  Thank you.  Thank you, Jay.  I--I think the combination of
scholarship and pragmatism there is the appropriate note for the commission's
formal session to end on as we transition from scholarship to pragmatism.  And
I invite you all to join us for a very pragmatic lunch in the Regents Room
where we'll have one or two...
<p>
Unidentified Woman:  A brief one, right?
<p>
Unidentified Man:  ...and a brief one, for a final repast.
<p>
JAY:  Oh, I'm sorry, Joyce...
