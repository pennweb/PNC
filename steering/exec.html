<p>
	The first plenary meeting of the Penn National Commission on
Society, Culture and Community was held December 9-10, 1996 at the
University of Pennsylvania.  The <a href=agenda.html>meeting sessions</a>
were intended primarily to trigger vigorous roundtable discussion among
members of the Commission, and two days of thoughtful and stimulating
discussion ensued.  <p>

Interest seemed to coalesce around three closely-related issues,
which were summarized by Dr. Rodin in her closing charge to the Commission
and further developed by Commission members in their comments on her
presentation:

<ul>
<li>the potential for mass participation in reasonable and reasoned
discourse about complex social issues, <br>

<li>the role and meaning of leadership, authority and expertise in our
society, and <br>

<li>the conditions for building and sustaining community.  
</ul>

<p>
<b>Towards a "Reasonable and Reasoned" Discourse</b>
<p>
Defining "reasonable and reasoned discourse" occupied much of the
first day of the proceedings.  A perceived decline in the civility of
social and political discourse was described by Dr. Rodin <a
href=keynote.html>(e.g., see her
keynote address "An Urgent Task")</a> and other members of the Commission.
Several possible explanations for this phenomenon were offered, including
the presence of new, powerless, or formerly unrepresented voices; the
impact of the mass media on our culture and the primacy of entertainment
values; the new dominance of marketplace values in politics and other
areas from which they were once absent; the end of post-World War II
prosperity and clarity of national purpose; and the general decline in
faith in important civic institutions.
<p>
Obstacles to reasonable and reasoned discourse were also
discussed.  The omnipresence and oppressiveness of market forces on all
forms of communication and interaction was frequently identified as a
significant barrier.  Mass media acculturated to a delegitimizing role and
the rise of "politics as entertainment" have left little room for
substantive debate on public issues -- particularly debate in which
changing one's mind is a real, possible outcome.  A perceived blurring of
the line between the public and the private was noted.  The emergence of a
culture of immediacy and a spreading "winner-take-all" ethic were also
described as obstacles to productive discourse.

<p>
Access to the discourse was identified as an important issue for
future examination.  How can a democratic society facilitate the inclusion
of all legitimate voices?  How can mutual trust and respect be encouraged?
How can the competing imperatives of empowerment through access to the
discourse, on the one hand, and the civility and rationality of that
discourse (a place for "reason-giving"), on the other, be balanced?  The
study of "hot button issues" will offer opportunities for the Commission
to explore how new participants and social movements assert their rights
to be heard and to challenge existing social and political norms.

<p>
<b>Leadership in a Mass Society</b>
<p>
The importance of leadership, authority and expertise -- in the
context of democratic values, mass markets, and a culture emphasizing
simplicity and immediacy -- was a second overarching theme of the two-day
meeting.  A perceived decline in the quality and significance of leaders
was noted.  However, students of history cautioned that this perception
may be an ever-present part of democratic societies.  Among important
questions raised by Commission members were:  What is the desirable
balance between authority and constituency, expertise and mass democracy,
leadership and market values?  Has the relationship between leaders and
their publics been inverted?  Have we lost an appropriate role for
empirical data and hard-won expertise on complex problems?  Can effective
leadership be reestablished given the intrusion of the marketplace into
politics?  Might it be possible to for the Commission to play a catalytic
role and work closely with professional organizations in reconceptualizing
professional norms to address some of these concerns? 


<p>
<b>Building Community in an Period of Fragmentation</b>
<p>

The loss of community was hypothesized as both a cause of and a
reflection of the decline of civil discourse.  Many members felt that
efforts to assess and assist in  community building activities should play
an important role in the Commission's work.  The continuous deepening of
social, economic, and cultural divisions within society clearly plays a
role in disrupting effective social interactions and productive discourse.
Determining realistic and appropriate boundaries of "community" and how
best to subvert the development of narrower artificial boundaries which
subdivide communities was identified as an important area for exploration
by the Commission.  Members were strongly engaged by presentations that
focused on "real world" examples of community building efforts and
expressed interest in exploring such efforts (as well as numerous projects
and commissions paralleling or complementing the Penn National Commission)
on a more systematic basis.
<p>


<b>The Commission's Work</b>
<p>
One common thread which ran through the rich tapestry of the
Commission's discussion was the role of the university.  It emerged as a
central institution in discussion of each of the three themes:
universities have a unique role to play in facilitating reasoned and
reasonable discourse, in providing leadership and expertise, and in
building community, both within academic institutions and disciplines and
beyond.  As many members of the Commission are academicians, universities
offer both a challenge and an opportunity for the Commission:  If the
Commission wants to impact the broader social and political world, we must
first try to put our own house in order or face the charge of "that's easy
for you to say."  At the same time, colleges and universities, both in the
U.S. and abroad, offer an environment in which to test hypotheses and
develop a discourse more independent of mass market forces and less
susceptible to media over-simplification.  Finally, the creation of
parallel or related activities on a large number of college and university
campuses might provide an effective and appropriate way of expanding the
Commissions impact and participation in its work.
<p>
As the Commission's work unfolds over the next three years, it
will remain focused on understanding and enhancing the role of "reasoned
and reasonable discourse" in contemporary life.  It will address the
questions of how the Commission can best encourage such discourse, engage
future leaders, and facilitate a sense of community in a period of social
fragmentation.  It will sponsor experiments, commission scholarly
research, make creative use of emerging communication technologies, and
form member task forces to work on specific problems, in a spirit of
innovative scholarship and practical application. 
<p>

The meeting concluded with the promise of a more detailed plan for
the Commission's work, incorporating many of the ideas and suggestions
described above.  This is currently in preparation by the Commission
staff, in consultation  with the Steering Committee.  The Commission will
meet again on June 11-12, 1996.
