<br><br>
The June 1997 meeting of the Penn National Commission on Society, Culture
and Community builds on our December discussions by focusing on the
impact of market and state forces on the dynamics and content of public
culture.  
<p>
Our keynote speaker will be Kevin Phillips, editor and publisher
of <u>The American Political Report</u>, columnist for the <i>L.A.
Times,</i> and author
of The Politics of <u>Rich and Poor, The Emerging Republican Majority</u>,
and
most recently, <u>Arrogant Capital:  Washington, Wall Street, and the
Frustration of American Politics</U>.  
<p>
We will then examine three "hot-button"
issues (affirmative action, campaign reform, and immigration) that
exemplify the impact of these forces on three areas of concern that
emerged
most clearly from our December discussions:  the Culture of Intolerance,
the Failure of Leadership, and the Fragmentation of Communities.   

<p>These
sessions will be led by
<ul>
<li><a
href=http://www.law.harvard.edu/Academic_Affairs/Faculty_Directory/e.html>
Christopher
Edley, Jr.,</a> of the Harvard Law School
and author, most recently, of <u>Not All Black and White: Affirmative
Action
and American Values</u>, who led the Clinton administration's review of
affirmative action. <p>

<li>Paul Taylor, who left his editorship at the
<i>Washington Post </i>  during the 1996 campaign to create the campaign
reform
organization Free Time for Straight Talk.
<p>
<li><a href=http://web-cr01.pbs.org/newshour/ww/rodriguez.html>Richard
Rodriquez,</a> the noted author of <u>Hunger of Memory</u> and
<u>Days of Obligation: An Argument with My Mexican Father</u></a>
and commentator for <i>The News Hour on PBS,</i>
<u>Harpers</u>, the <i>
L.A. Times,</i>  and <u>U.S. News</u>. 
</ul>

Their presentations and our plenary
discussions will in turn set the stage for the initial meetings of three
Commission working groups in the areas of behavior, leadership, and
community.
