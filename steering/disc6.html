<p>
MARTIN MARTY:  I, for one, wish we had an hour for each of you.
Bill Rauch, you were complimenting your colleagues who left you a little
overcome and you've been a third one to overcome us.  We've got a lot of
rich
stuff here to work on.  I see a plot of kind of creative subversion of
boundary in all three of these.  We're supposed to be looking for some
synthetic elements just as we did this morning when Joel Fleishman, the
other person that had to force sound bites out of people instead of
letting
them talk at leisure, asked for that.  So we want syntheses; I think we're
still on the issue of what is it, and we don't want to leave this
afternoon without a little more precision in the concept of what is the
'it'
that we're beginning to pursue here.  So I'm ready to take hands and your
comment.  Yes, Joel?
<p>
JOEL FLEISHMAN:  Well, I think the 'it' is community.  I think the 'it'
is community and the subcommunities that make it up.  I think
at least that's the way it seems to me, and these
three presentations really provoke me in that direction, because thinking
about the question of what constitutes community, what about the
subcommunities within the community and how do they relate to one another
and
how do the subcommunities relate to the community as a whole?  And then
the
question really is:  What kind of dialogue can go on within a society that
permits the continuation of the society?  And, obviously,
there are gray areas.  And so that's the `it,' at least it seems to me
in terms of this discussion.
<p>
And you know, I don't know whether that's helpful or not.  But the
three presentations today certainly do fit together, it seems to me, in
that way and particularly the last thing that Bill said, because
subcommunities can be defined in a lot of different ways
as community can.  And I think we need to think
about that because I think what we're sensing is that
there are divisions within the society that make community
difficult, if not impossible.  We hear a presentation from Mary
about a society that may or may not have a community.  Although across the
group, I think most people think they do, but they're
divisive.  There's divisive fragmentation there that makes
community difficult or impossible.  And I think what we're sensing is
that the same kind of situation in the United States.  So I
that's what I think we're talking about.
<p>
MARTY:  Calvin Trillin, did you have your hand up?
<p>
CALVIN TRILLIN:  No.
<p>
MARTY:  No.  Yes, one, two, three.  Edna.
<p>
EDNA ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  I'm very deeply grateful for these presentations.
They were wonderful. I share so much with Mary, and there's very little I
can do across this
floor about the sharing.  One thing that is known to be shared between our
two
countries is that everyone--anyone who thinks they have a solution to the
Irish problem or anyone who thinks they have a solution to the
Israeli-Arab
problem doesn't under[stand] -- anyone who offers a solution doesn't
understand the problem.  I have a question for you.  I'm intrigued by the
fact that you said 70 percent of parents are interested in shared
communities;
and you had other statistics like that.  How come?  What brought them to
be
interested in coming together?
<p>
FITZDUFF:  There are two levels at which you're functioning in Northern
Ireland, and I was just talking to someone the other day past a very
difficult
summer who was saying that some of the ongoing social issues work where
people
looking at social issues together in a very deeply divided country area
where
Protestants and Catholics had been coming together for a period of six
months
to look at issues.  And it came to pass the facilitator was told in
confidence
by both sides that they were being threatened by the fundamentalists
within
their own community for fraternizing with the enemy.  Nevertheless,
despite
the awful summer, people were continuing to come together.
<p>
So I think at one level, although loyalties may call people onto the
streets
and in the past called people to murder, at another level there is an
acknowledgment that, you know, the future is about a shared community.
There is an area in north Belfast where 600 people
have been murdered, one square mile.  But you would not be able to tell
when
you were moving from a Catholic to a Protestant street.  So we are so
integrated in some of our tiny areas that we know there actually is no
division. <p>

Other areas, we also know that many of our incapacities are being
developed in
terms of work increasing the integration there.  So there is an
underlying desire to try and make it work.  One of the consistent
surprises
has been that this figure has actually grown and grown, particularly over
the
last 10 years.  It has grown from 80 percent to 90 percent in
some cases in terms of desire for work and living pattern.  So it is about
the
best of us and the worst of us.  And when it comes to the crunch time when
fear prevails, then we will actually withdraw into our communities.
<p>
ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  So it's really recognition of reality?  That's what's
behind it and not...
<p>
FITZDUFF:  It is a recognition of reality...
<p>
ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  Yeah?
<p>
FITZDUFF:  ...for us.  And it's about us giving options and choices
so that that reality--we can have other realities.  And I think that it's
tremendously hopeful...
<p>
ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  It's optimistic.
<p>
FITZDUFF:  ...that there is this kind of sort of deep desire, as it were,
to provide for our children and, indeed, for ourselves opportunities that
we ourselves did not have. <p>

MARTY:  Our sequence will be Thomas, Joyce, Michael and Judith.
Thomas? <p>

THOMAS BENDER:  Yes, one of the ways--and I think most of us in the room
agree as
an antidote to our fractured, fragmented society is the creation of
community.  The problem is that in the past, the creation of community has
very often been a process of drawing boundaries, of deciding who's in and
who's out and of excluding.
<p>
And what I found so promising about the three approaches that we
just heard was that you're talking about creating communities that break
down
the traditional divisions and traditional barriers, that create inclusive
communities that don't simply reinforce traditional identities and
traditional
divisions but instead recognize that those divisions exist and work to
somehow
creatively engage them and get people to begin talking about their
common ground and their differences.  And this I find to be an
extraordinarily
heartening way of thinking about the question of recreating civil
institutions, but without falling into the trap of creating communal
institutions that simply continue to foster division and exclusion.
<p>
JOYCE APPLEBY:  I think the 'it' is purposive action.  Every one of these
examples--there was a group that defined either a need or a problem or a
valuable human experience, and then mobilized the talent and the will and
the
resources necessary to bring it about.  And this is what we
need demonstrated more than anything else, a kind of a collective mastery
against social drifts that we are all uneasy about.
<p>
MARTY:  Michael? <p>

MICHAEL PIORE:  These presentations also raise, for me, an interesting
problem about
the relation of scale and community.  And I remind me [of] the
phrase about 'sinking globally, acting locally.'  I mean, it's
mind-boggling
to think about the United States--it's probably mind-boggling to think
about
Northern Ireland, for that matter, as one community.  But certainly with
the kind of scale and diverity here, it's very difficult.  So Jim's
experiment is extremely intriguing because it makes an effort to
establish something like a local community, however transient that
represents
the whole thing.  I mean, it's quite novel and intriguing.  I
still don't know what to make of it.  I mean, it's intriguing.
<p>
And the response Bill got at the end, I mean, it's June 30th, a
community.  There's something similar to Jim's in that there's
something random about it.  And yet it produces something very
interesting,
too--I mean, some sense of community.  But I don't have a question here.
I
think it's just an observation about how [I] remember visiting Sweden a
year ago
and realizing it was slightly smaller in population than LA County and
thinking that this whole level of discussion, what's the way in which
the size relates to this possibility of establishing community is the
issue.
<p>
MARTY:  Bill, do you want to say just something?  It's interesting to
me that it worked for you in a town of 160 people and it worked in Watts.
I
think that relates to our scale question, doesn't it?  What's it
like?
<p>
RAUCH:  The difference between the work in a town of 190 and the
community of Watts is that everybody in that town of 190 knew we were
there,
and we were major celebrities.  In Watts, I would like to think that a lot
of
people knew about us, but I knew for a fact a lot of people didn't.  And
as
big an impact as we had on that community, we didn't make--in terms of
percentage of the population of the community, it was a smaller dent; and
yet, you know, it's always about individual people.  And we've been
reaching
as many people in the urban communities as the rural communities.
<p>
MARTY:  Yes, please?
<p>
FITZDUFF:  Can I just say--and, I mean, I am transfixed by the
experiences on both sides of me.  And I am very aware that what is common
between them is that they did create an experience in which people
mattered,
and they gave a meaning to people's experience.  Can I say one of the
frightening statistics is since the cease-fires were called and our war
finished in Northern Ireland, several things have risen.  Racism has
risen.
Drug addiction has risen.  We had the lowest ordinary decent crime rate,
as we
called it, in Western Europe; it has risen.  And depression has risen.  So
we
are having a huge problems coming to terms with the fact we are no longer
involved in warfare.  And what that says to me is that people were living
at a
heightened level of meaning that I think is provided by these kinds of
experiences; and I think that is something that actually you can
transpose it right across many of the issues that we've been talking
about.
And I think these provided a meaning[ful] experience to actually address
so many of
these issues that they did carry people through, and I did mean it when I
said
it was these kinds of experiences that are transformative.  That has
certainly
been our experience.
<p>
MARTY:  And by the way, since you're the timekeeper of the timekeepers,
you've mentioned some adjustment of the schedule.  When should this
session
end?  Five minutes?  I see a hand behind you.
<p>
RODIN:  Yeah.  A few more minutes.
<p>
MARTY:  All right, we have you, Neil and Joel.
<p>
RODIN:  We won't take the next break.
<p>
MARTY:  Right.
<p>
RODIN:  We'll have people wander out if they need it and go right on to
the
next session.  A comment and a question.  First of all, your examples are
wonderful and really profound, but I want to provoke you a bit.  There's a
fairly substantial
social-psychological literature begun, actually, in the early '50s that
demonstrates a lot of support for the old adage that 'familiarity breeds
contempt,' and that the notion of getting people together and having them
interact, although there was a sort of mythic appeal to that when, in
fact, it
happened particularly in living arrangements but also in a variety of
other
circumstances, people came to like each other less because they had
instances
that confirmed some of their negative stereotypes.
<p>
So one question that I have is, is your effect due to the fact that it is
short term, that the consequences for then being together--except in
your case, Marie, where I really think--but even so, if you're not
drawing people from the same community, what are the long-term
consequences, and
would that alter the benefits of their short-term experience?
<p>
And then secondly, do any of you have data on longer-term impact of this
short-term experience?  Because I would find that convincing as a
counterweight to this data set that I'm familiar with.
<p>
FISHKIN:  Well, with the deliberative poll on the first British
one, as I said, we went back nine months later, and NORC has just gone
back
recently to the American participants who wanted to go back after the
election
in order to see their view of the election and how they voted.  So
we'll have that data soon. <p>

There was, in attitudes, if you take the baseline poll as time one, the
after
poll as time two and then many months later as time three, on every
attitudinal item, time three was somewhere between time one and time two.
There was some backsliding as they went into their normal environment, but
there was also some considerable staying power for the particular
attitudes.
And on issues about civic engagement and knowledge there was incredible
staying power.  And on issues that tried to get a tolerance, also, there
was a lot of staying power, too.  So we think it led to some mutual
understanding.  Now I don't know about this familiarity breeding contempt,
except I would say that our task was to put people in a context of a kind
of equality where we had trained moderators; nobody dominated the
discussion;
everybody got to talk and there was an atmosphere of mutual respect which
was informed by the public character of the proceedings.
The norms were one of mutual respect and engagement.  And in that context,
people really had every incentive to behave more like ideal
citizens, and they did.  And they found it satisfying, I think satisfying
because of the diversity.
<p>
But just say one other thing:  I got drawn into doing three of
these on another set of issues with regulated public utilities, who said,
'We
have to consult the public.  We'd like to do your process, because if we
do a
poll, the public has no information; if we do focus groups, it's not
representative, or we can't prove it's representative; and if we do
town meetings, we just get organized interest groups and the rest.'
So I pondered this and I said, 'All right.  You can do this, but all the
stakeholders have to participate--the environmental groups, the consumer
groups--and pass on the briefing materials, the questionnaire, the rest.
The
decision makers for you are the Public Utility Commission of the state.
They
have to participate in the dialogue and answer questions from the sample.
It
needs to be televised and the data has to be publicly available.  If you
satisfy all those conditions, I'll help you do it.'
<p>
I thought they would go away.  In fact, they came back and did it under
those
conditions.  The Public Utility Commission was so amazed at what it was
like
to see ordinary people grappling with a complex problem that--and how
they were different from lobbyists that they changed the rules of the
state to
require that the citizens be consulted only after they've been informed.
So
three public utilities have now done this now because the rules have
changed.
<p>
Now we asked the people what they thought of the experience, to rate it
on a one-to-10 scale.  And in the national issues convention and in the
public
utility cases--in all of the cases, they rated it--about 75 percent gave
it a
perfect 10.  Now this astonished me, because the national issues
convention
had sexy issues, had presidential candidates and was on national
television.
The public utility things were about what kind of power plant to build and
the environmental trade-offs and the rest.
<p>
These were boring, I thought, boring issues.  But, in fact, people got
such
satisfaction out of being empowered and knowing that their voice would
matter.
And once the commissioner said, `We're going to make the company do
whatever
you say,' they felt tremendously empowered, and they also got tremendous
satisfaction out of talking to people who were so different from
themselves,
because we had all strata of the service areas, and these were fairly
large
service areas all strata of those societies represented and
crossed all the racial, ethnic class boundaries.  And, in fact, we had a
very complicated issue about Spanish speaking, and one part of Texas
sat down in Corpus Christie, where we did it.  But we handled that,
I think, well.
<p>
Well, the other thing is, by doing three in a row with different panelists
in
slightly different social contexts, we got the same results all
three times.  So the process was replicated.  But I think it has a lot
of robustness and power and, as we can see from going back to the
people, the persistence of the opinions, the satisfaction they get--and
they
get the satisfaction not from the substance of what the subject is, but
from
the process of talking to people across all social strata under conditions
where they're convinced that their voice matters.  I think that's the key
to
it--that is, it's a form of empowerment that overcomes rational
ignorance because we were able to convince them that their voice would
matter.
<p>
FITZDUFF:  Just to take up the argument, Judy, I'm very
conscious one of the best books I've read is by a man called Donald Kagan
on the origins of war.  And you remember it.
<p>
FISHKIN:  An old friend of mine.  Go ahead.
<p>
FITZDUFF:  Well, he makes a point that one of the mistakes we make is to
think that peace is the norm and war is the abnormal.  In fact, what we
are
learning is that living with difference takes an extraordinary amount of
work.
And he reckons that we should really reverse the amount of work we put
into
peacekeeping, as opposed to warmaking.
<p>
And the point I want to make [is] you're quite right, it is not enough
just
to have people live together.  They also have to have spaces where they
can
talk through the problematic issues as they arise so that they do not
become
contentious and do not retreat back into their ghettos.  So you have a
conscious living that actually manages division within an area or within a
unit.  And we've been doing some work on this.
<p>
The other thing is, the evidence is that people will retreat from
inclusiveness if they have not got a continuing group to belong to that
encourages that sort of inclusiveness.  And this is one of the mistakes
that I
think many of us have made, that we actually have not provided, within our
communities, enough opportunities to continue inclusive behavior at a
social,
leisure, work or other.  And without that, you're actually in very
difficult
waters, because it is likely, in a time of tension, that people will go
back
into their ghettoization.  But the evidence is fairly clear that it takes
a
lot of conscious work and it takes the creation of alternative groups that
provide a sense of belonging that actually competes and wins over, as it
were, the belonging that is exclusive as opposed to inclusive.
<p>
MARTY:  We're over time. I'll take Neil and Joel and
we'll close the session.  Oh, excuse me.  Bill, I'm sorry.
<p>
RAUCH:  I just have a quick anecdote that I think gets right to the
heart of that, which is the community in Mississippi that we worked
with--I
don't think I told this story during the slide show, stop me if I did.  I
always carried it as kind of a little secret shame that there wasn't
interracial adult theater that kept happening after we left.  In the vast
majority of the communities it has, and it didn't happen in Mississippi.
So
for about four years, I carried that with me and because we got a
lot of publicity off that and I felt like, 'Oh, we did well, but the
community
didn't, somehow.' I went back and visited the community and I was pulled
aside
by a good 20, 25 separate individuals who told me the exact same story,
which
is that Port Gibson had become a Main Street USA organization, federally
funded program to revitalize small town main streets, and that they had
been awarded recently as having the most racially integrated board of all
400
Main Street USA organizations and they said, `It's all because of the
play.
It's all because of the play.  It's all "Romeo and Juliet."  We all talk
about
that.'  And that really taught me to get my blinders off and to recognize
what
the effects of our work--we'll never know the full effects and that they
go
well beyond theater. <p>

NEIL SMELSER:  Quick observation on your deliberative polling.  Would
suggest possibly three variables that might account, in part, for why it
was so special.  One might be called the stranger effect, that these
people were not invested in one another and, therefore, they become more
involved with one another.  Second is the odyssey effect, namely, it was
a short journey that had a beginning and a known end, and this also
permitted much deeper engagement because they knew it wasn't going to have
any
consequences for their lives.  And third might be called a Hawthorne
effect.
They were very special because of this experiment.  And they were flown in
and
there were a lot of reporters there.  And I think all three of those
things
might have contributed.  And raise caution about generalizing it to
how it might work in a fixed community where people have knowledge and
prejudices and stakeholders and so on.
<p>
MARTY:  I think what's emerging here is the double problem of space, how
big
the scale and time-- how long.  I think we have to keep both these very
vivid.  Joel, will you close the session?
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  Well, I don't know that I deserve the dignity of closing
the session or just by sheer chance.  But in any event, I will say this,
that
what Judith said about familiarity breeding contempt reminds me of what
of what Noel Coward said.  It may well be true that familiarity
breeds contempt, but the truth is that without a little familiarity, you
can't
breed anything. <p>

And that brings me to my second point, and my second point is this, that,
you
know, what we are seeing here is the creation--and it's highlighted in--I
think -- in what everybody said here, that by essentially trying to
create a new kind of community that overcomes the
divisiveness of the older kinds of communities.  I mean, that's really
what's
at stake, and that's, really, in many ways, what the task of
this commission is, at least, as I see it as one of them.
<p>
Think about the question, how to teach us how to think about
that question.  I mean, what's really lacking in discourse today is a
framework for thinking about how communities and subcommunities can live
together in a very, very heterogeneous society--an increasingly
heterogeneous
society, where there are imbalances in terms of rights over periods of
time.  And yet the issue is how do we, as communities, think about those
things?  How do the subcommunities think about those things?  And then, if
there were an action component, how do you use community
building as a strategy to overcome those divisive aspects of the
pre-existing
communities?  That's my point.
<p>
MARTY:  On familiarity, when John Paul II, a Pole, was elected pope, NBC
asked me for a sound bite, as a Protestant--what did we think would happen
to
ecumenical relations?  Because he'd never met a Protestant.  And I told
him,
`Not to know us is to love us.' And we've got a little bit familiar
since then.  Those of us who teach dread the 1:30 hour, when the eyelids
are
heavy, and there were no heavy eyelids today.  Our three on this panel
have
really quickened this session this afternoon.  Thank you very much.
