<p>
JOEL FLEISHMAN:  Thank you very much, John.  Our second presenter will be
Leonard Eron, a student of television and its impact on our
children.  He is the chair of the American Psychological Association's
Commission on Violence and Youth.  Leonard has spent four decades
researching
the learning of aggression in children and the effects of violence in the
media.  He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1992 after
teaching at
Yale, Iowa and the University of Illinois at Chicago.  He is the recipient
of
numerous honors, has testified frequently in Washington on the effects of
violence in the media and has edited the Journal of Abnormal Psychology.
Television has certainly been one of the most profound changes in our
society over the past half-century, and there's no one better qualified
than
Leonard Eron to help us understand its impact.  Leonard.
<p>
LEONARD ERON: Thank you.
I'm in the rather awkward position of having my prepared statement
anticipated
by much of the discussion yesterday and this morning and by Kathleen's
excellent presentation.  But I'm going to go ahead and make them anyway
because as an old-time learning psychologist, I know that repetitive
trials
foster learning, especially in white mice.
<p>
Television is the most obvious, ubiquitous and potent source of
information
available to children growing up in the United States.  Children are not
only
being entertained, but educated by television.  The information they
receive from the endless number of cartoons, sitcoms and prime-time
programs
that pervade the airwaves cannot help but affect the way they interact
with
and view society.  The telecommunication revolution of the 20th century
has
created a new environment for children in which television, videos, CDs
and
movies, [to] say nothing of television games, have assumed center roles in
socializing them, while parents have lost influence.  For better or worse,
the
mass media are having an enormous impact on our children's values, beliefs
and
behaviors.
<p>
Since violent content is a staple of American television programs, it
should
not be surprising that extensive exposure to this medium in early
childhood
promotes cognitions; that is, beliefs, attitudes, justifications, which
support the use of aggressive and violent behavior in solving
interpersonal
problems, in relieving frustration and in acquiring material possessions,
as
well as power and influence over others.  The cognitions learned through
this
early exposure affect behavior not only concurrently but also over time,
and
their influence can be detected in the aggressive, anti-social and
criminal
behaviors of young adults.  In order to counteract the influence of what
is learned via the media, children must develop attitudes and normative
beliefs about the appropriateness and frequency of aggressive behavior
which
do not support the use of violence to solve the problems that I noted.
<p>
I mention violence, specifically, because this is the area in which I have
been doing research for 40 years and to which I will be referring in this
talk.  However, I believe it is possible to generalize from the findings
on TV
and violence to other areas in which this conference has specific
interest,
for example, quote, "incivility, shallowness, fragmentation and
polarization
of our political, social and cultural life," unquote.  Yesterday, it
seems, we
confined ourselves to discussing incivility; and as Martin Seligman noted
yesterday, violence is the ultimate incivility.
<p>
As for incivility, as mentioned yesterday by a number of persons, we
had a prime example of the demonstration of such behavior for all to see
when
a well-regarded professional athlete spit in the face of the umpire and
then
went unpunished at that time.  In the days before TV, such an event might
have
been reported on the radio or written about in the newspapers.  But the
graphic display of such behavior and its constant repetition before an
audience which must have included countless numbers of children, probably
has
contributed to setting norms for civility in the United States.
<p>
This is what is so different about TV, and I reverberate now to the
remarks
made by Cal Trillin this morning.  And not only in his comparing the
old-time gridiron dinners, --what went on in that dinner, which
President Clinton and his wife were present--what is different about
television is that the youngster or the viewer is bombarded by at least
two
senses, both audition and vision.  What is so powerful about the
television
game is that there's a third sense involved and that is the kinesthetic
sense,
where the individual not only hears and sees the violence, but carries it
out
himself or herself by by pushing a lever or pressing a button.
<p>
I believe that this kind of visual, auditory, kinesthetic repetition
contributes to setting norms for civility.  Observational learning is a
powerful mechanism for acquiring all kinds of behavior and attitudes, and
I
will refer to this later, especially as it pertains to violence.
<p>
Since 1960, a body of evidence, coming from both laboratory research and
survey studies based on real-life experiences, has confirmed that there is
a
causative relation between the observation of aggression and violence on
television and subsequent aggressive and violent behavior on the part of
the
observer.  This is especially true for young children, and for them the
effect
is not just temporary, but is sustained over years.  For example, one
study
conducted by my colleagues and me shows that the amount of violence
youngsters
watch on television at age eight is related to their aggressiveness 10
years
later and to the seriousness of criminal acts 22 years later, at age 30.
This
relation holds up even when initial aggressiveness, IQ and social class
are
statistically controlled.  Over 35 years of research by many behavioral
scientists has validated the causal connection between the observation of
television violence and the subsequent violent behavior of young viewers
with
a significant carryover into adulthood.  A number of national commissions,
composed of eminent scholars, who have reviewed all the available studies,
have all come to the same conclusion:  There is a causal relation between
viewing violent television and subsequent behavior.
<p>
Related to to the previous point I made about the gridiron dinner,
many people say, `Well, the media have always been violent.  Shakespeare
was
violent.  The Bible is violent.'  But how many youngsters watch
Shakespeare
three and four times a day on television?  You can't even get high school
students to read Shakespeare without Cliff notes.  So I don't think it's
the
same as the Bible and Shakespeare, because you have this bombardment in so
many senses.  More pertinent, perhaps, to the relation between violence
viewing on TV and subsequent behavior than the total amount of violence is
the
context in which the violence is presented, which is also related to what
we
discussed yesterday.
<p>
In a recent report, a team of researchers from the University of
California-Santa Barbara, University of North Carolina, University of
Texas
and University of Wisconsin present data based on 2,500 hours of
entertainment, movies and reality programs, excluding sports and nightly
newscasts, on 23 cable and broadcast channels, including PBS, during the
1994-1995 season.  The study monitored programs between the hours of 6 AM
and
11 PM over a 20-week period.  It was found that the majority of programs
on
television contained violence; that one out of four violent interactions
involves the use of handguns; that the perpetrators go largely unpunished;
and
that most violent portrayals do not show the negative consequences of the
act.
It is the contention of the authors of this study that the context and
explicitness of the portrayed violence is at least as important as the
total
quantity of violence.
<p>
Another important finding of this study is that anti-violence messages are
scarce on television, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of such
messages.
So do not expect any messages on TV, at least in the near future,
attempting
to discourage incivility, shallowness, fragmentation and polarization.
<p>
Finally, in their executive summary of the research report, the
investigators
state, quote, "The sheer frequency with which violence is encountered
through
the television landscape and the number of violent incidents that are
observed
by most viewers can contribute to desensitization and fear as well as
providing ample opportunities to learn violent attitudes and behavior,"
and
contributes to what Kathleen and her associates have called `the mean
world
syndrome.'  And, remember, this study that I've just quoted was sponsored
and
paid for by the cable TV industry.
<p>
The most obvious effect of violence portrayed on the screen, of course, is
the
actual copying of the behavior when the actors who carry out the mayhem on
screen serve as models for behavior.  This is especially effective when
the
observers are young children.  Young children very often imitate what they
see
other persons do, particularly if the other person is a desirable hero.
As I
said before, observational learning is one of the most powerful mechanisms
through which children acquire social skills and learn how to behave in
society.
<p>
However, there are a number of factors which, it has also been shown,
affect the learning of behavior observed on the TV screen.  Whether or not
the
child identifies with the actor and whether or not the actor is perceived
as
possessing valued characteristics affects the likelihood of observational
learning.  If the actor is rewarded for the aggressive behavior, the
observer's more likely to model the behavior.  On the other hand, if the
observed aggressive behavior is punished, the child is less likely to
imitate
the behavior.  If a child is constantly exposed to television and film
heroes solving problems aggressively without any subsequent punishment for
the
aggressor, the child will mimic these behaviors.
<p>
In the study of television context, which I just noted, the researchers
assessed the rewards and punishments associated with violence and found
that
in the majority of violent scenes, aggression, actually, is neither
rewarded
nor punished.
<p>
However, it is explicitly rewarded 15 percent of the time, almost
as often as it is punished, 19 percent of the time it occurs.  When
punishment
does occur, and this is important, it is usually towards bad characters
and
only rarely to good characters, even when they have committed serious
violence.  Thus, the characters that children are likely to identify with,
the
good guys, are rarely discouraged from acting aggressively by punishment
for
their acts.  However, the modeling of behaviors seen on the screen is not
the only way that TV affects behavior or the observer's behavior.  TV also
influences a developing youngster's cognitions about how the world
operates,
what is appropriate behavior in a given situation and what to expect in
the
behavior and attitudes of others.
<p>
Let me skip over much of this, because there are some
points I do want to make.  As I indicated before, studies on the effects
of
television on the developing child have not been limited to the effects of
viewing violence on the screen, although by far the largest number of
studies
are in this area of violence.  Other studies have investigated how the
roles
of men and women in various social and ethnic groups are portrayed.  A
chief
source of information about the values of society are the stories told to
young viewers in television entertainment.  This is important, therefore,
to
study how social roles in various groups are shown on television.
<p>
For example, on the TV screen, police officers are usually seen in highly
active, violent scenes, high-speed chases, shootings, beatings--if you ask
children about what police officers do, most report that police officers
chase
people, arrest them, shoot guns and drive fast cars.  However, if you ask
police officers, most of their daily activities consist of filling out
forms
and writing reports.  In fact, many policemen report they have rarely or
never
fired their guns at lawbreakers.  Thus, it can be seen how viewing the
regular
fare on TV molds attitudes and normative expectations about various roles
persons hold in society and contributes to shallowness, fragmentation and
incivility on the part of youthful observers.
<p>
So can television be used to foster the goals of this conference?  I
believe
there is sufficient evidence that some children's programs successfully
break
down the stereotypes and foster intergroup goodwill.  The children's
program
"Sesame Street," for example, has, from its beginning, systematically
portrayed blacks and Hispanics in a positive light.  Research has
demonstrated
that exposure to "Sesame Street" makes children's attitudes towards these
groups more favorable.  Sex role stereotypes have also been countered by
this
and similar programs.
<p>
However, when programs and public service announcements are deliberately
designed to encourage pro-social behavior, their producers have often come
up
against some harsh criticism by those who contend that this is a form of
brainwashing, using the public media to indoctrinate a whole nation of
children to someone's ideas about what is socially good.  And I think we
heard
some of this yesterday afternoon.  Some persons argue that the whole
concept
of pro-social behavior is mostly pretentious and dangerous, encouraging
conformity and leading children to look to the group for their opinions
and
that it encourages namby-pamby behavior by young people who will not stand
up
and fight when such behavior is called for and appropriate.
<p>
One more thing.  Although these assertions may be
defensible at some level, it is not unreasonable to expect television,
which
is such a powerful instructor, to teach children there are alternative
ways to solve interpersonal and other problems than the use of violence,
to
break down stereotypes which are damaging to the individual and society,
to
promote civility in one's interaction with others and, in general, to
contribute to the solution of problems raised at this conference rather
than
to add to their pervasiveness and intensity.  And that--according to my
watch,
that's only 15 minutes.
