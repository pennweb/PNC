Thinning of Social Discourse / Silence on Race<p>
Presentation by Professor Thomas Bender

<p>
JUDITH RODIN:  Well, I hear the lunch conversations were wonderful.
I hope you enjoyed the food as well.  Our first session this afternoon is
another attempt--or the beginning of our attempts to help put the
perceptions
and anecdotes we shared this morning into some sort of historical context.
<p>
To begin that process, we've called upon Tom Bender, who's the dean of
humanities and professor of history at NYU, who will share with us some of
his
thoughts on the evolution of our public discourse.  Tom, as many of you
know,
is a cultural historian of the United States and has focused much of his
research on the intellectual history of American cities.  His books
include
"Intellect and Public Life,"  "The University in the City" and "New York
Intellect."  And they strike many themes relevant to this commission, and
I'm
agreed, Tom, I'm very pleased, that you've agreed to open this discussion.
<p>
Following Tom's presentation, we will hear from one of Penn's most
stimulating
faculty members, Professor Lani Guinier.  As you all know, Lani
demonstrated
to an entire nation how calm and unfailing good humor, maybe,
and a lifelong commitment can turn one of the worst media bashings in
memory
into a personal triumph.  Lani is famous for her remark that even her
mother
didn't recognize her when the media was finished with her.  But her Penn
colleagues and her many admirers here recognize and adore her.  So Lani
reminds us that the discussion of race or the absence of the discussion of
race is certainly one of the most important topics in any effort to place
American public discourse into some sort of historical perspective.
<p>
It is with great pleasure then that I introduce to you, first, Tom Bender
and
then Lani Guinier.
<p>
THOMAS BENDER:  Thank you very much.  This is a somewhat daunting task.
Don't take it any more seriously than I do.  If I had a title for this
discussion, it would be probably the thinning of American political
culture.
Is the impoverishment of American public discourse recent in origin?  That
seems to be one of our questions.  It is easy enough to construct a
narrative
of decline.  One has only to recall Lincoln and Douglas in the wake of
Dole
and Clinton.  But it is equally easy to undermine that narrative.  19th
century politics was rife with insult and reasoned argument was often
eclipsed
by spectacle, by liquor and by corruption.
If I can make a contribution to this discussion as a historian, it will be
by
avoiding the jeremiad and by reframing the issue.  I will try in what is
truly
a hilariously brief compass to contrast our present with the past in terms
of
the changing meaning of public culture and the relation of politics to
broader
social and cultural themes.  And I'm a little uncomfortable doing this
because
some of the historians who have written the most important work on this
are
sitting out there and not here.
<p>
Though I want to avoid a simple narrative of decline, part of my point is
to
highlight certain deficits that are the legacy of a fairly long history.
What
we suffer is not the result of either the Cold War or the end of the Cold
War.
My intention is to place our present challenge into historical
perspective, to
propose that it is the product of a century of change.  Our present
circumstance is the result of a series of developments driven in part by
broad
social transformations, but also--and this is the tricky part that already
emerged earlier in the discussion--but also by reforms sponsored by
educated elites with aims similar to our own.  The trouble we
confront is a thinning of our political culture and public discourse.  I
hope
that I will be able to give some meaning to that phrase as I go on.
<p>
19th century political culture in its heyday, between roughly 1830 and
1890, was
marked by intense partisan identities, strongly competitive parties and a
politics of spectacle.  Political culture was intensely masculine and it
was
white.  Racial and sexual exclusion was not accidental but central to the
standing of the citizen, to use Judith Skhlar's term.  Political
affiliation,
moreover, was part of personal identity.  Rarely did one change parties.
Political rhetoric, therefore, was not designed to convert voters--the
clambakes, torchlight parades and militaristic party rhetoric aimed to
mobilize voters whose votes were predictable.  Almost all voters voted a
straight ticket.  Indeed such ballots were available in preprinted form.
<p>
The press was integral to this political culture.  It was financed by the
parties, not by advertising, and it was openly partisan.  The press and
party
rhetoric constructed a world view that nurtured the political identity of
white male citizens, and it offered these citizens a narrative
interpretation
of American history and political life.  These narratives, bizarre as they
often were, had an important role in sustaining political commitments and
providing meaning to public life.  Party activities and symbols had a
social
function as well.  They formed social solidarities.  Politics, thus,
sustained
social life and social life flowed into politics.  These social practices
were
widely recognized by foreign visitors as the predominant form of
entertainment
in the United States.  This spectacular model of politics constituted an
important ritual of legitimation that sustained popular support for
constitutional government.  And a large proportion of eligible voters
participated.  Eighty percent turnouts were not at all uncommon.
These thick dimensions of 19th century political culture, clearly missing
today, were valuable, but they did not necessarily promote rational
argument.
There is much that is appealing in this thumbnail description of 19th
century
political culture, but there is too much that is disturbing to allow us to
recall it with nostalgia.  Not only were the Lincoln and Douglas debates a
rare event, but racism, sexism, voter manipulation and the spoils system
were
commonplaces.
<p>
A bit more than a century ago, this incarnation of American politics
became
the target of political reformers.  These reformers, except for being
exclusively male, might be understood as our social equivalence, highly
educated, civic-spirited professionals.  Without the self-consciousness we
would feel, they referred to themselves as the best men.  And they felt
that
intelligence and learning, their personal and class capital, had
insufficient
weight in American politics, a politics of mass democracy and spectacle.
The
post Civil War politics, they thought, gave too much power to
quantity rather than to quality.  The numerous ignorant voters in
immigrant
communities organized by bosses and duped by partisanship had more clout
than
did the educated.
<p>
Some of the reformers, E.L. Godkin, among them, proposed compromising
universal male suffrage--Francis Parkman did the same--claiming that
democracy did not imply the vote.  Godkin and his ilk also rejected the
ideal
of positive government that had been so evident in the Civil War and
Reconstruction, turning instead to laissez-faire theories of political
economy.  Essentially, if the government did nothing, it did not matter if
the
rabble--their phrase for the increasingly organized working class--on some
power in it.  Their version of reformed politics presumed that informed
citizenship and reasoned argument, not corruption and blind partisanship,
should define a proper civic life.  By 1920, much of their program had
been
achieved, parties were weakened and independent voters became respectable.
Reformers made the world safe for the educated, independent voter.  But at
the
same time, elitism and disdain for the less well-educated made the world
of
politics less welcoming to the immigrant and working-class voter.  For
African-American citizenship, these discouragements were more substantial.
<p>
With these developments, voter participation began to decline.  That has
been
steady ever since, save for the reversal in the New Deal era when workers,
African-Americans and immigrants, were drawn into the Democratic Party
politics.  One might fairly argue that nearly all the past centuries'
progressive proposals for campaign and election reform have weakened
parties
and the idea of partisanship.  By our own time, parties have very little
role
in the selection of candidates or the determination of policies.  They
have
lost the monopoly of political information replaced by the objective
coverage
of mass journalism, government is increasingly reduced to administration,
increasingly fiscal administration, and influence is achieved through
particularistic organized interests of which identity politics is only one
and
a relatively weak one compared to business interests.
<p>
In their quest for a more honorable and reason-giving politics, reformers
rejected the social and symbolic aspects of partisanship.  Whatever the
potential gains in rational discourse, this thinning, isolated politics
from
everyday life that had importantly structured, political identification,
meanings and responsibility.  It made for greater  voter volatility and it
made voters vulnerable to a new kind of political opportunism.
<p>
These political developments, as I have suggested, went hand and hand with
changes in the press.  Many of the late 19th century reformers were, like
Godkin, journalists and they pressed the idea of an independent objective
press, free of party affiliation.  In 1850, 95 percent of the press was
partisan, which meant not only having a political disposition, but meant
as
well that it was directly funded by a political party.  The New York
Times,
with its now more than century-old commitment to objective news, was and
is a
model of the new journalism.
<p>
Advertising made this revolution possible.  We probably all favor this,
but I
would make two remarks.  First, it was clearly the older connection
between
politics in the press that Tocqueville praised as the foundation of
American
democracy.  And second, there is increasing evidence, most notably the
powerful argument of C. Edwin Baker in "Advertising and the Democratic
Press," that advertising's role in supporting the press seriously limits
the
diversity of opinion and the rigor of reasoned discourse.  With the
dissolution of partisanship, of party narratives in the press and on the
stump, and of the social aspects of party life, it became harder for
citizens
to feel much like members of parties and therefore responsible to some
larger
body or movement.  Today, two-thirds of voters split tickets, and about 40
percent of the electorate identify themselves as independent.
<p>
By now, I hope, you have some sense of what I mean by the thinning of our
political culture, but we're really only halfway through the century of
change.  In itself, the replacement of a ritualistic politics with the
politics of education ought not to have had seriously negative
consequences.
But in conjunction with a series of other developments, all of which I
will
associate with the 1920s, the change helped transform politics in a way
that
effectively displaced the political and the seriousness entailed by the
political.
<p>
Soon after World War I, Walter Lippmann published "Public Opinion."  It
was
characterized at the time by John Dewey as, quote, "Perhaps the most
effective indictment of democracy as currently conceived ever
penned."  Lippmann followed in 1925 with "The Phantom Public" and Dewey
responded in 1927 with his only work of political philosophy, "The Public
and
Its Problems."
<p>
What was the nub of this extraordinarily important debate which, in my
view,
announces the democratic dilemma of our century?  During the war, Lippmann
had
been excited by the possibilities of expertise and deeply disappointed in
the
capacity of the public.  How could the citizen understand the demands of
modern society and government?  A vision of citizen participation that was
plausible in the age of Jefferson was now an anachronism.  Instead of
Jefferson's faith in the competent citizen, Lippmann despaired of the
incompetent public so easily manipulated by propaganda during the war.
<p>
He proposed to accept what he found; let the political theorists and
practitioner assume an incompetent passive public, one drawn to the new
consumer culture.  Let government be managed by insiders and experts, with
a
regular plebiscitelike vote of confidence.  Dewey, who acknowledged that
abundance and entertainments threatened the centrality of politics in the
common life of Americans, insisted that the passive public was
historically
created, not an essential condition of modernity.  Effective competence,
he
argued, was circumstantial, not innate.  He proposed that the public,
nourished initially at the local level in communities connected by
discourse,
by voice, by the same face-to-face problem-solving associations that
Tocqueville observed, could and should find itself and become the basis
for
a participatory democracy, one in which experts serve the public rather
than displacing it.  He deeply believed that there was something one
might call the intelligence of democracy.
<p>
Unfortunately, Lippmann's vision of an incompetent public predicted the
future
better than did Dewey's call for a revitalized
public.  Lippmann's assumptions were precisely represented in mainstream
political science, especially in the behaviorist and pluralist movements
that
followed World War II.  Elite and academic lack of faith, even deep fear
of
mass democratic publics in the 1940s and 1950s, contributed to the
demobilization of the more inclusive public of the New Deal era.
<p>
Parallel developments of a broader, cultural sort contributed further to
the
weakening of the public culture and the displacement of reasoned
discourse.
The repeal of reticence, to use Rochelle Gurstein's phrasing--inflated
private matters and pushed public matters to the margins.  Personality
replaced both character and issues.  Exposure of private vices undermined
the
public's business, which is, in Dewey's formulation, those private acts
that
affect collective life.
<p>
There were, of course, good reasons to expose the private realm--secrecy
cannot and ought not be trusted.  But with public discourse already
weakened
by the dissolution of partisanship in parties, the new sensibility and the
sensational journalism that sustained it emptied the public culture of
much of
its political content.  In the 19th century, entertainment and politics
refused; in the 20th century, one displaced the other.
<p>
Democracy and public life, already thinned, were further diminished by
advertising and survey research.
<p>
In the 1920s, Edward Bernaise, the founder of modern advertising,
remarked that businessmen learn to use--I quote--"the pageantry and
spectacle
of politics for their sales campaigns." `But politicians,' he complained,
`learn nothing from business, nothing from those who,' quote, "study the
public and manufacture products based on this study." It was amazing to
him
that, quote, "the very men who make their millions out of cleverly devised
drives for soap and cars, will turn around and give large contributions to
be
extended for vote getting in an utterly inefficient and antiquated
fashion."
<p>
Fifty years later, such a charge would seem fantastic.  The voter is
treated
as a consumer and the political content of electioneering has been
diminished
to the vanishing point.  The same broad, social developments provided both
the
opportunity and the need for marketing and advertising of products and
candidates.  Modern selling, for example, depended upon the dissolution of
locally based, socially embedded or connected patterns of production and
consumption.  Likewise, modern vote getting as marketing depends upon the
dissolution of the continuing social affiliations and traditional
political
narratives represented by parties and the partisan press.
<p>
It is revealing that Paul Lazarsfeld's classic voter study, "The People's
Choice," published in 1944, was initially conceived as a study of consumer
choice.  The availability of funding for voter studies prompted the change
of
focus, which Lazarsfeld accepted because he felt the choice in the two
domains
was essentially similar.  The point was made a few years later with
startling
straightforwardness by Rosser Reeves, an ad man and GOP adviser.  He
characterized the man in the voting booth hesitating between two levers as
no
different from the consumer who was, quote, "pausing between competing
tubes
of toothpaste in a drugstore."
<p>
Lazarsfeld's work produced what he called the law of minimal effect, which
had
quite a significant impact on campaigning and advertising.  He concluded
that
opinions of the consumer and the voter could not be changed by
advertising.
Rather, the point of advertising and campaigning must be to associate a
product or a candidate with beliefs already held by the voter or
consumer--and
this is the important part--perhaps belief with no use value in the case
of
products and no political meaning in the case of candidates.
To my mind, the most consequential implication of this use of word and
image
disconnected from narrative explanation is that it obfuscates the relation
between cause and effect and that is fatal to reasoned discourse.
<p>
Let me just now rush to a kind of conclusion.  The age of parties is past;
we
ought not lament that.  We ought not long to restore them.  Yet we need to
recover by alternate means two of the functions they performed.  First, we
need public narratives competing in diverse public narratives to sustain
political commitment and meaning.  Such narratives steady the electorate
and
make citizens less vulnerable to media manipulation.  Second, we need an
institutional space continuous with social life where public matters of
interest to diverse individuals and groups can be engaged by them
directly.
Such practical civic education is the foundation of responsible public
life.
<p>
There is, however, a third necessity, one noted by Tocqueville.  Citizens
are
not a public unless they have work to do.  They will come together into a
tentative engagement only if they have work to do together, conflicts to
resolve.  Any localized, face-to-face public must be empowered, for it is
only
the real-life give and take of politics that can nourish the enlightened
self-interest that so impressed Tocqueville.  He never fully elaborated
his
concept of enlightened self-interest or `interest rightly understood,' as
he
sometimes put it, but in it, one finds an essential but difficult to
calibrate
combination of assertion of interests, respect for difference and
commitment
to civic responsibility.  Put differently, social distance breeds
contempt,
whether in political or cultural life.  We must shorten that distance, not
to
make people like each other or to feel at one with each other, but to make
them work with each other.  Public work is both the means and the end, and
Dewey may have been right, that only more democracy can cure the problem
of
democracy.
<p>
Thanks.
