<p>
JUDITH RODIN:  I'd like to turn this session over to Joel Fleishman, who
will
be the moderator for us and, Joel, I thank you for stepping in at the
eleventh
hour to do this.  David Hamburg was to chair this session and was taken
ill
yesterday and sends his regrets.  But, Joel, thank you very much, and I
turn
our speakers over to you.
<p>
JOEL FLEISHMAN:  Thank you very much.  I have to get up
closer here.  Thanks very much, Judy, and after Dean Jamieson's
discussion,
it'll be up to us to try to keep up the same speed and focus.  This
session is
 supposed to continue our exploration of the causes of the explosion of
disruptions 
of discourse in community, and we've dealt with the press now.
<p>
Now we're going to move to three presenters who are going to talk about a
different--each a different aspect of change that has made this
end of the 20th century an extraordinary period in human
history.  The changes that they're going to describe in social policies,
in the impact of television on our children and in the cultural and social
upheavals of the 1960s are frequently suggested, just as the press is,
as sources for our current problems.
<p>
I hope that many members of the commission are going to have
other candidates to offer as explanations and that they will come out
during the course of the discussions.  But we'll start with our
presenters,
and each has been asked to speak for 15 minutes, and I will keep
time, and then that will leave us about 45 minutes for discussion, during
which we can tear apart or ask questions of what they've said and
deduce further causes.
<p>
Our first presenter is going to be Professor John Skrentny from the
University
of Pennsylvania.  He came to Penn in 1994 after earning his PhD in
sociology
from Harvard.  He has recently published a widely reviewed and very
well-received book, The Ironies of Affirmative Action, in which he
carefully
examines the historical development of affirmative action policies in the
absence of serious public debate.  He is already at work on a second
volume
describing the revolution in rights and entitlements during the course of
this
century.  His presentation today will examine how such revolutionary
changes may have played a role in the rise of incivility and polarization.
Shall I just stop there and then introduce the subsequent speakers as they
go?
Professor Skrentny. <p>

JOHN SKRENTNY:  OK.  Yeah, I've spent the past several years studying 
the origins of policies that I thought seemed to divide so many Americans,
such as affirmative action, bilingual education, multiculturalism,
immigration, some areas of women's
rights.  These policies are often collectively referred to as the rights
revolution.  And you don't need me to tell you that they've generated a
lot of
controversy, a lot of emotional debate, and that some of them, especially
affirmative action, have generated emotional debate almost to the complete
exclusion of reasoned, dispassionate analysis.
<p>
Now, for me, their controversial nature makes it a wonder how they ever
developed at all, and that's what I'm going to be talking about today.  In
lieu of a thesis statement and then trying to muster up evidence to
support that, I'm just going to make seven basic points; just spend a
minute
or two on each of them regarding some of the things I found in my
research.
<p>
Now the first point I want to make is that some of these policies and the
momentum for others developed in specific historical circumstances that do
not exist anymore.  Now when most of us think about the domestic effects
of the Cold War, we usually think of the arms buildup, the space race and
the
Red scare; but, increasingly, social scientists and historians are
discovering that there were some positive effects to the Cold War, and
one of these was the development of a new interest and legitimacy in
racial and ethnic minority rights.  The United States and the Soviet Union
were competing for the allegiance of neutral, emerging nations in the
non-white parts of the world, and they were doing this competition
within the context of taken-for-granted rules of human rights.
<p>
Now American racial discrimination, particularly discrimination against
blacks, became a major propaganda point for the Soviets as well as for the
Chinese.  And American presidents from Truman through Johnson were
continually
reminded by the State Department that American prestige was suffering in
India
and Indonesia, in countries in Africa, because there was so much
propaganda
being disseminated through these nations from the Soviet Union,
emphasizing
the terrible treatment of African-Americans in the United States.
<p>
Now this helped ease the creation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  It
helped
create some of the impetus for relatively open refugee policies.  It
helped create some of the impetus for reforming the immigration laws,
which
allowed Asians and Africans to come to the United States on a basis that
was equal with Europeans.
<p>
Now in the later 1960s, as most of you will recall, the United States was
overcome by racial violence in the cities.  In my own research, one of the
things I discovered was that the Johnson administration used this context,
the
crisis context of this racial violence, to channel Great Society programs
to
African-Americans in the cities and to initiate unpublicized
affirmative action programs.  And it's interesting that the Johnson
administration chose this empowering strategy to deal with racial violence
in
the cities.  And I think some of the evidence that I saw showed that the
Johnson administration was kept informed; that the Soviets and the Chinese
were making great propaganda gains by showing the world about the racial
violence in the cities.  And any use of troops would have made this even
worse.  And so there were these unpublicized, early attempts at
affirmative
action, but I think the Cold War context made them especially a kind of
prudent strategy. <p>

Now that's the first point.  The second point is, not surprisingly, then,
the
United States was not alone in having a rights revolution.  Not
surprisingly,
the Soviet Union tried hard to present itself to the world as a precocious
multiculturalist nation.  The Soviet Union instigated affirmative action
in
its civil service as much as it could.  It had people from the Asian
republics
within its entourages when it visited nations in Africa and Asia.  The
Soviet
Union created friendship societies which celebrated the cultures of Asian
nations and African nations. <p>

Other Western European nations, as well as Canada, of course, have great
developed welfare states, but these nations also have large programs
where they finance the cultures of immigrants and guest workers, in
Sweden, for example, and in Canada, as well.  And I don't think it
was only a coincidence that, two years after the United Nations declared
that
that a child had a right to his or her own language and own culture in any
society--two years after the United Nations made this declaration in the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Bilingual
Education
Act was passed in the United States.  So this was a worldwide
phenomenon.
<p>
My third point is that much of the rights revolution is surprisingly
bipartisan in its origins.  Where legislation was needed, such as
the Immigration Act, the Bilingual Education Act and rights for other
groups,
Democrats and Republicans took part and played crucial roles in developing
these policies that would become so controversial.  When it was executive
orders that were at the basis of new rights-oriented policies, both
Republican
and Democratic presidents took part.  And I think much more
attention has been placed recently on Richard Nixon's crucial role in
developing affirmative action. <p>

Now what happened was--this was--it was an amazing time.  The politicians
were often ahead of the civil rights lobbies, often ahead of the different
lobbying groups.  And you could see legislators in Congress and
domestic policy-makers in the White House as thinking, `Well, there's
other
groups that are similar to blacks.  And, you know, we could generate
policies and make this analogy and use the rights language that was used
for
some of the policies with blacks.'  And there was this proliferation then
of
policies, often with the politicians ahead of the lobbyists.
<p>
Most notable, I think, is the 1973 legislation that was passed that gave
rights to the handicapped.  There were advocates for the handicapped.
They weren't asking for rights.  The politicians brought in that language.
The Bilingual Education Act was initiated by a Democrat, but he was joined
rapidly by Republicans in signing onto this wonderful law which
could communicate very clearly to specific constituencies that certain
legislators cared.
<p>
Ideology didn't seem to matter too much here.  I've seen letters to
President Nixon from Barry Goldwater saying, `Look, let's give more
attention
to Latinos.  There's a lot of votes to be won there.'  And during this
brief period, really, from 1965 to 1975, targeted policies became the
norm.
And I think it's also important that mainstream America, during this
period, was distracted.  Mainstream America was paying
attention much more to the Vietnam War and to other issues.  They didn't
really see that some of these different policies that were developing.
There
was very little commentary on affirmative action during its formative
years,
very little commentary on bilingual education.  So both parties joined in
and rights were the language.
<p>
My fourth point is that--well, while a lot of the rights revolution came
in
legislation and executive orders, another big part of it came from obscure
bureaucracies and in slowly developing, incremental court decisions.  For
example, much of the development of affirmative action came from--or was
accomplished by relatively anonymous bureaucrats in a particular
organization called the Office of Federal Contract Compliance.  The
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was another big part of this.
Without hearing this and without guidance from Congress or the White
House,
these relatively anonymous bureaucrats made the crucial decisions of who
was
going to be receiving affirmative action, special recognition or
preferences.  Which groups would be the special ones was decided by people
anonymously without a public debate.  And as far as
I could tell, the legislators in Congress and in the White House weren't
even
paying attention to what was going on during this time.
<p>
So the bureaucracies were important.  The courts were also important.  The
courts created the crucial idea that discrimination could occur without
intent, that discrimination was possible without someone actually
intending to
discriminate.  This received much of its development in the courts.  I
think that after the failures of the first 10 years after the Brown vs.
Board of Education decision in 1954, the courts almost took this as
a point of inspiration or something to be avoided.  They showed a
tremendous
amount of vigor in policy-making.  And in a lot of disparate policy areas,
the courts would make connections to the school desegregation example when
they would start to talk about affirmative action in employment or when
they
would start to talk about bilingual education for Latinos.  So a lot of
the story of the development of these policies came from
anonymous bureaucrats and in the courts' incremental decisions.
<p>
My fifth point is that our incredibly, I think, complex political culture
leads to varying resistance to these different rights policies and special
government protections.  It varies across policies.  I think 
it's very specific.  Many groups have rights and government benefits,
and there's almost no controversy.  I think that government aid to the
handicapped and the 1990s Americans With Disabilities Act--enormous
expenses,
when they're just simply measured in dollar terms, are associated with
these laws, but there's very little resistance to these laws.
<p>
Senior citizens have also gained special protection.  If someone is
riding the train in from the main line, which is a pretty upscale suburb
of
Philadelphia, over to the west, a 65-year-old corporate lawyer making a
six-figure salary will only have to pay $1 to ride the regional rail
transport
into Philadelphia.  Now going the other way, mostly with African-Americans
on
board, the trains from Philadelphia to the suburbs, to the fast-food
restaurants, African-Americans making minimum wage will pay the full fare;
and, as far as I know, there's been almost no public debate on this
particular issue.
<p>
Something that's been of great interest to me is veterans' preferences.
In
the federal civil service and in 47 states, veterans are able to receive
special benefits.  They simply have points added to their civil service
exam
scores.  In some states they're given absolute preference.  As long as
they pass the exam, they're put at the top of the list.  And there's been
very
little controversy about veterans' preferences. <p>

Now as I talk about these examples, these examples may make a lot of moral
sense to you.  You might think, `Well, this makes sense,' and `That's a
different case,' and `This also sounds reasonable.'  But I think that the
principles that are at the foundation of a lot of these different kinds of
preferences and benefits that are acceptable to Americans are usually
unexamined and ultimately arbitrary, and I think, too, a lot of black
leaders,
especially--they have seen that.  And they've made this case that I'm
making right now repeatedly and it's never really stuck.  It's never
really
been discussed in politics in Congress or in the mainstream media.
<p>
Now on the other hand, affirmative action for blacks, affirmative action
for
women--this is said to be a violation of equal opportunity.  Now our
value on equal opportunity and meritocracy, though, seems to mean very
little
in the 47 states that have veterans' preferences and in the federal civil
service.
<p>
So I just want to emphasize that it seems to me that the resistance over
these
policies varies a lot, and I think we have an extraordinary and
complex political culture that lends a legitimacy to certain rights and
certain government protections and an illegitimacy to others.
<p>
My sixth point:  I think the cause of our conflict over these policies--as
I
just said, it's partly the result of our political culture, but also
because
the rights revolution was from the beginning a public-relations disaster.
Of
course, bureaucratic decisions and court decisions do not receive
30-second TV
spots with a lot of fanfare telling Americans, you know, what great
decisions are being made.  But I want to emphasize that the bipartisan
laws
that were passed--they were really sold only to the groups that were going
to
benefit.  They weren't a part of stump speeches meant for a national
audience.
<p>
Now there were bipartisan--originally, the right eventually backed away
from
many, if not most, of these policies, but it was when they backed away
that
they began to give these policies a lot of attention.  It was when they
backed
away that they began to critique bilingual education and affirmative
action.
The right made political gains by telling Americans how terrible these
policies were.  They usually didn't mention that they had a big part in
bringing these policies about.  Now the left remained holding the bag.
The
policies already existed, but I think the left never gave a reason for
Peoria,
Illinois, or Lincoln, Nebraska, or Orange County, California.  The left
never
gave these places a reason to support these policies.
<p>
The most repeated point in the left's defense, I think, was simply that
these
new policies were rights.  But simple claims that these policies were
rights,
I don't think, made for a persuasive argument.  It was just an assertion.
At
worst, these claims that these policies were rights could imply that
mainstream Americans were racist for resisting what were civil rights.
And
when this implication was made--and sometimes it was explicitly
stated--there
was, not surprisingly, a raising of emotions, a raising of temperatures, a
raising of tensions.  Countercharges of racism are frequently made in
these kinds of debates, leading to a downward spiral and incivility in
our discourse. <p>

And I think this whole situation was made worse and I'm frankly a
little pessimistic that a public-relations campaign could have
been mounted in the '70s when attention began to be
directed to these policies, because it was a
negative factor that the policies already existed when mainstream America
began to learn about them.  It was almost as if there was a sense among a
lot
of mainstream white Americans that these policies were developed and
they weren't consulted.  And this added a kind of
resentment from the very beginning when these things began to be debated.
The
policies already existed.  Mainstream America was not a part of
the public debate when these things formed.
<p>
Now I didn't want to end on a negative note.  And so I want to
emphasize in my seventh and last point that there is some reason to be
optimistic about things, even though a lot of damage, I think, has been
done to our body politic and our political culture.  I want to emphasize
first
that our political culture can change.  There's this widespread
legitimacy to veterans' benefits and veterans' rights now.  But if you
look at
it historically, this used to be limited only to disabled veterans.
Able-bodied veterans weren't seen to be a part of these deserving classes.
It
was only, really, with World War II that American benevolence toward
veterans began to open up and increase to include able-bodied veterans as
well as disabled veterans.  So the political culture is complex.  I think
it's
a very important factor here, but it can change over time.
<p>
Second, and to allude to some of the things that Kathleen Jamieson said,
the
media can avoid focusing on these issues.  I think that affirmative action
and
bilingual education and immigration--they're hot-button issues-- but the
media
doesn't have to be pushing this hot button all the time.  I mean, they
just
can't get their finger off of that.  And that keeps the emotions high and
it keeps Americans' attention on some of these complex and controversial
policies. <p>

And the last point I wanted to make--it's too bad Paul
Begala's not here.  I wanted to compliment something that President
Clinton
had been doing--I think he's kind of stopped--and that was that Clinton
for a time was frequently stressing Americans' common ground.  He was
actually
derided in the press for this.  I remember Time magazine counted how many
times Clinton used the phrase `common ground' in a speech and just kind
of left it at that, exposing cynically the manipulations that were
apparently
there.
<p>
But I think there's a lot of common ground that is not a part of our
debate on affirmative action, and that is that about 80 percent of whites
maybe even as high as 85 percent of whites think that
discrimination is wrong and the government should stop and do what it can
to
prevent discrimination.
<p>
Now it just so happens that whites and blacks vary tremendously on how
much
discrimination they think is going on in American society.  Whites think
there's very little; blacks think there's tremendous amounts of
discrimination.  I think this gets back to a point that Cass was making
yesterday about, you know, getting some information in here and bringing
some
people together.  I would think that a high-profile, bipartisan
commission,
something that would have legitimacy to both the left and the right, to
focus
on this area of common ground, how much discrimination actually does exist
in
America, and it might be able to bring some people together, focus on
those
specific issues, as Cass was saying, rather than just getting into the
abstract notions of reverse discrimination, and maybe bring in some
civility into this discourse and perhaps make some progress as well.
Thank you.
