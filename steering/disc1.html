<font size =4>


JUDITH RODIN:  Thank you.  I'd like to throw it open for discussion.  It
was
meant,
hopefully, to pose questions.  Is the anecdotal picture that I painted
accurate, and in what ways?  Yes or no?  Joyce.  
<p> JOYCE APPLEBY:  One
thing I don't know ... is this on?  
<p> RODIN:  Yes.  

<p> APPLEBY:  All
right.  One thing I think we'd have to consider is that a lot of the
incivility comes from the fact that we are hearing increasingly from
groups that in the past have been suppressed, whether they're kids in
school or battered women or workers--the very lowest rungs of the
occupational ladder.  And they're behind that expression, that fresh--we'd
have to say--expression which we've had for the last 20, 30 years is a lot
of anger and a lot of inarticulateness which leads to perhaps a
vulgarization of public discourse.  But I think it would be unwise to just
look at the means of their expression and not see that this is a very
important development.  And the whole notion of victims' rights, I think
we can, you know, be annoyed by it sometimes and see that it's overdone. 
And yet this is a very powerful moment in the history of civilization for
collective groups of victims to speak out or shout out or swear out.  So I
guess I fear the discussion of civility may be the--might lead to people
who aren't a part of this victims' movement being offended by the style. 
And I think we'd have to recognize why so much of the--so much of the
expression is--comes with a--you know, a volley of anger and of abusive
language.  
<p> RODIN:  Important point.  Please.  

<p> LAWRENCE LESSIG: 
Yeah.  Following up on this point, it seems the way you use the idea of
culture in your talk was ambiguous between two very different ideas.  One
was kind of taken for granted, this is the way we all look at the world
sense of culture; and the other is an idea of culture as something we're
creating, self-consciously reflecting upon what culture should be and
making it like that.  Now to describe [it] like that it doesn't sound good
or bad, but you identified the constructive dimension with people like Pat
Buchanan.  Pat Buchanan was saying we have to think constructively about
what kind of culture we want to make, who we want to be.  

<p>
And the association would--it just came to me.  The association was that
when we try to constructively make a culture something, that's where we
get
the wars; that's where we get the tension or the battle which it sounded
like was bad.
 But I think that this comment brings out quite well the idea that often
this act of
constructing a culture is an act of looking at the culture we take for
granted and saying there's something bad about this and we need to remake
it in a different way, and it can't help but express itself in uncivil
terms,
because the way the culture--the taken-for-granted culture resists the
change,
and it resists it by calling it not bad or a bad culture; it resists it by
calling it uncivil.  Uncivil is the way that the taken-for-granted culture
preserves itself, not by being political and saying it's good or bad but
by
saying, `This is just not the way we do things.'  That's what civility is
about, right?
<p>
So incivility is an important means here and an important means to
remaking a culture.  Now we could decide culture should just be something
that
we all take for granted and it's too hard for us to think constructively
about
how to make it into something, but that's an extremely important and
conservative, in obvious ways...
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
LESSIG:  ...mode of interacting with culture.  And the is:  Is there a way
helpfully to be constructive about culture without it--I mean, accepting
it will be uncivil.
<p>
RODIN:  Do you see an inevitable dialectic between the constructive
perspective and the remaking of culture and less civility or
more rancor in the debate or in the actions?  That's an important point.
<p>
MARTIN SELIGMAN:  I'm not convinced it's a dialectic or a healthy
dialectic.  There are a group of psychologists who have been trying to
predict when people die by looking--physical death--by looking at
cognitive
complexity and simplicity.  And there's a good bit of evidence that in the
last two to five years before death, an individual--if you'll look at
the complexity or simplicity with which they speak, there is a dramatic
decline from complexity to simplicity as a harbinger of death.  One
wonders if
something like that might be generalizable to a society.
<p>
RODIN:  Hmm.  Please, Joel.
<p>
JOEL FLEISHMAN:  I'd just like to pick up on what Professor
Appleby just noted a minute ago.  It's not only a question of victimized
groups which are suddenly getting voice, but it's also the fact
that increasingly the nation itself is multicultural.  There are many,
many more groups, and whatever consensus there may have been on the
culture before, we're having many different pictures of culture by
different
ethnic and racial and religious groups.  And that in itself is going to
exacerbate the incivility, it seems to me, because of the context.  It's
just
a much, much larger pool with people seeing things differently.  And I
think that contributes also to the problem.
<p>
RODIN:  Yes.
<p>
ROBERT WIEBE:  I would like to just take Joyce Appleby's remark one
step further and think about civility as a negotiated process.  Civility
isn't
something we can, I think, reasonably bring to this increasingly
complicated
and diverse exchange.  Civility is going to be--the meaning of `civility'
itself is going to come out of a collective process.  And if we think
about
ourselves as not facilitators so much as observers of that process
and, yes, I guess, and facilitators, too, as people who might help
encourage interactions that will define civility.  We don't know yet, I
think,
what civility means for other people.  Those people who have not had
voices
should have a voice in the meaning of civility.
<p>
RODIN:  And as the largest part of the population believes that
incivility is a problem, at least for American society, one wonders
whether
each of us feels the right to have a certain kind of voice but doesn't
feel
that others have the right to have quite as strident a voice.
<p>
WIEBE:  Exactly.  And that's why we need an exchange to try to see how it
is
that various people construct that set of boundaries for effective
discourse
we call civility.  But because we are amongst people who have been
articulate or
tend to reflect the values of people who've been articulate over
many years, we have a certain sense that will, I think, be very, very
different from the sense of civility that these sort of newly these newly
voiced groups will have.
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
PAUL VERKUIL:  Yeah, that's a very helpful exchange for me at least,
because the proposition that you pose that there are new voices and
they're
inarticulate, they don't play by the same rules, etc., and, therefore, you
know, are the rules wrong or are the voices wrong is really
addressed very well by the notion that what we have to do is work with the
rules.  Because in some respects, this ought to be a very optimistic time.
After all, these new voices were never heard before, and now they are
being
heard.  And that, rather, to me seems a social positive in some
respects, we're frustrated by it.  And that means that society hasn't made
these adjustments that maybe it should make, which leads to a role for a
group
that might try and say:  How do you mediate new relationships?  How do you
redefine civility for the next millennium?
<p>
RODIN:  David.
<p>
DAVID BROMWICH: I just want to notice that within your talk, the elements
that are
being picked out are those that would presume that the groups you're
designating are, for instance, victims' rights groups, but the Ku Kluxers
are
also among the inarticulate, among the starved for attention, among the
not
noticed.  And I think we have to watch out for the sort of false and
paternal
benevolence that would say they can say anything they like in their new
voices, and we'll call it civility.  Can't anything end up being called
civility?  Or is there something valuable in that that we want to try to
talk
about?  The most pathetic moment in the spliced together exhibits you had,
I
thought was the umpire talking.  Was that because of newly enfranchised
groups
in baseball?  I think the question is, I mean, your talk was meant to
be suggestive and perhaps can't be more than that, and I think it was,
but I'll just stop.
<p>
MICHAEL SCHUDSON:  There was something in the umpire's comment
that also I noted, and that was that the umpire's speaking was so
thoughtful, it seemed to me and so hesitant as well about trying
to figure out exactly what was the right thing here.  And it was, it
seemed to me,
 a very civil voice about an incident that disturbed him and many others.
But it 
raises for me several questions, one of which that I have some qualms
about in 
your presentation is sort of the seamlessness of it in your very opening
remarks 
that things like the spitting incident and bombing of a federal building
in
Oklahoma City are all part of the same phenomenon. I think that's
a question.  I would not think that's a conclusion I'm not ready to
come to.  And the related part of that is whether civility is even the
right word here 
or whether we're looking for some distinctions here that are there some
good civilities 
and bad civilities?  And, I mean, you had some nice instances of the
suffragists.  That was incivility.  And there's no question but that was
incivility at the time.  Well, is that the sort of incivility we might
approve
of?  And how can we make those distinctions?
<p>
RODIN:  Critical, huh?
<p>
AMY GUTMANN:  Well, maybe I'm less clear about what civility and
incivility
is than some people.  When Carol Moseley-Braun got up on the floor of the
Senate and denounced her colleagues who were in favor of the Senate
putting
its imprimatur on the Confederate flag, she said, `This is an affront to
black
Americans.  This ought to be an affront to all Americans.'  That was an
extreme statement.  People were taken aback.  In fact, it was a moment in
which changed lots of people's minds.  I don't think that was uncivil of
her.
Civility, if it's going to be used in a positive way, I think, has to have
something in it of substance as to whether we're trying to address each
other
on terms that are compatible with sharing a society together.
<p>
Those terms may be quite radical in some cases compared to the terms with
which we're--some people or maybe all of us are used to sharing.  But if
it
means being pleasant to one another, if it means talking in terms that
don't
rattle each other or don't make--as one senator said, ` I'm going
to vote against this.  It's going to make my father and ancestors turn
over in
their graves, but I think it's--now I've been convinced it's the right
thing
to do.  Why?  Because I can't share a society anymore on the terms that I
was
used to sharing it with.'
<p>
We have to, if we're going to continue using the term `civility' in a
positive
sense, disengage it from notions of calm, status quo
kind of discourse but re-engage it with what I think its roots are, with
the
discourse that has a civic dimension that allows us to share a society
with
all the other people with whom we ought to be sharing it and not impugn
each
other's motives but rather try to address each other in ways that we can
move
on and share a society together.  And on those terms, civility
incorporates
the previously disenfranchised.  Indeed, if it doesn't, it's not civil.
<p>
THOMAS SUGRUE:  As I was listening to your speech, I thought of the
debate over incivility and the emergence of various uncivil or incivil
discourses as a reflection of deeper rooted insecurities, about a society
that's undergoing profound economic, social, demographic transformations
in
the nature of the workplace, the structure of the labor market, the
nature of the family, communications and media, that few fully comprehend.
There are sweeping changes that we're still really trying to make
sense out of.  So as I read, my distinctive reading of
the urgent task is to develop a roadmap of these large and still
largely incomprehensible social changes that are transforming society and
are
being reflected in this incivil discourse and the small panic about
incivility and to think about shaping political institutions and responses
that attempt to grapple with those larger changes of which incivil
discourse, I think, is a symptom or a manifestation.
<p>
MARI FITZDUFF: I hesitate to speak as someone who doesn't come
from the United States, but I must say I was quite startled by the
compilation
that Professor Rodin put together.  I actually come from a society that is
extraordinarily polite.  You would not have any of those kinds of
instances in
Northern Ireland, but we do murder each other for our political beliefs.
I
think the question I want to put was:  What, and it follows what I think
one of the other speakers said,  what would a society look like if we were
a
civil society?  What kind of society would that actually be?  Do we have a
notion of what we would like to see and how we would like to be able to
talk
with one another?  I'm not sure if it's too soon yet to focus, in other
words
civility, if that's a big enough word, if it is the word that we want
to help frame where we want to go.
<p>
RODIN:  But we will come to that certainly with your presentation and
others tomorrow afternoon, come to the question of:  Do we have examples
of a
civil society in which people have struggled for ways to get along?
Civility is 
in behavior, not only in rhetoric.  And we focus, I think, and certainly
the critics 
of our current condition are focusing quite a bit on the rhetorical aspect
of it, 
but I would add problematic behavior to incivility, at least in my own
operational definition.
<p>
CLAUDE STEELE:  I think there's an economic dimension. Incivility sells.
Tupac Shakur is probably an example of that.  But it strikes me that a
good 
conception of civility will have to incorporate some means of getting
groups 
that feel disenfranchised enfranchised in civility.  I mean, one
important source of incivility has to be a sense on the
parts of the population that they have no investment in the civil society
and that incivility becomes a way of protesting that, of their points of
view 
and their voices.  And it also sells.  
<p>
And so in getting to some set of terms of negotiating civility, for
example, I think our concept has to broaden to include doing
the things or structuring society in such a way that this kind of
problem, this source of incivility is reduced.  The thinking of the
inequality of income, for example--as long as that exists the way it does,
there will be a tremendous pressure from the bottom of people who
don't feel as invested in a civil society in the sense that we've been
talking about.  So I think that a broader sense of civility would
encompass 
that kind of incorporation. <p>

CASS SUNSTEIN:  I'm trying to get a better handle on the notion of
civility, and I have a little bit of a hierarchy.  I thought kind of a
defining case was the spitting.  And why is that a defining case?  Well,
it's like a mediated statement of contempt or an effort to humiliate,
so at least its social meaning in that context.  It's different from anger
or
rage, which I think Amy's getting at, anger or rage can be civil.  So we
might see that as one case.
<p>
Then another case would be Buchanan or David Duke, where I think it's
relevant
that these are in some sense status quo defenders.  But what's going on
with
them is an effort to define certain social groups as outlaws.  And so it's
not
that different from spitting in the sense that there is a kind of effort
to
show contempt or to humiliate in some of that.  Then we might think, in
the third category, would be someone like Louis Farrakhan or Malcolm X, at
least the early Malcolm X, where there was a kind of dehumanization or
incivility at work, but there might be an excuse or justification by
virtue of
the substance.  I'm not sure exactly how to think of that.
<p>
And then we might think in the fourth category would be someone like
Martin
Luther King, who was, you know, extremely tough and critical but was very
careful to distinguish between rage or something at persons and rage at
practices.  So I don't know if there's a way to define this notion of
civility apart from paradigm cases and working out from there.
<p>
RODIN:  Hmm.  Mike.
<p>
MICHAEL USEEM:  I would just make two analogs, the first coming from a
research terrain
that I walked looking at corporate restructuring.  You think about, at
least
from media reports and others, about what happens inside a  Conrail, or
a few years ago, IBM or GM, it gets pretty uncivil when companies are
going
through a lot of change.  We need to reconstruct civility, but we've also
got to get through the change.  So I guess the point I take from that, or
I
would make with that, would be to think about civility with justice or
something to that effect.
<p>
Second analog I would make is from a comment that really has stuck with me
from "Apollo 13."  Many of you'll recall this if you've seen the film or
read
this wonderful book upon which it's based, the Lost Moon by Jim Lovell.
Gene Krantz, all this bad information is rolling into flight control
there in Houston, says, `Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You told me
what's wrong here.  Tell me what's right.  Tell me what's right.' And the
point he's making there, which is obvious, I guess, is that to fix what's
wrong, 
we've got to build on what is right.  And so I think
implicit in your comments, the notion of where we see what's wrong, we
also have to build on what already is strong in our culture, our
leadership
and the like.  Second point I would make is we need to think
about the glass half full along with half empty.
<p>
RODIN:  That's right.  Tom.
<p>
THOMAS BENDER:  I just wanted to suggest that it seems to have been
implied a different
way here by what people have said is that one of the resorts to extreme
language or incivility, if we're calling it that, has to do with a sense
of powerlessness.  
And, again, the poignancy of the umpire is, in part, although he didn't
become uncivil,
I mean, his sense that there was no way, no mechanism, it seemed, for him
to get some
redress for this abuse of him.  And I think that we have a society in
which large
numbers of people, not just the emergent of historically powerless, but
large
numbers of people feel powerless.  And I think that they're trying to get
someone's attention.  And this goes back to the notion about incivility
sells.
One of the questions is whether we have any fora, commercial or
non-commercial, in which you can get some attention.  You have no
institutional power.  You have very little wealth, which seems to be the
main
way to get institutional power in this society, and so what if you are
extreme enough, 
if you're Imus or anyone else, you can get on the air or you can do it
through CDs, 
whatever it is. I think there's something deeply wrong there.  I don't
know what it is,
but I think powerlessness--a pervasive sense of powerlessness is a very
important
element of all of this.
<p>
RODIN:  I think that's what Americans are expressing in these polls when
they're asked whom they trust and say that they don't trust one
another and that they have such increasing levels of cynicism and despair
and hopelessness.  It isn't only.  And I think politicians have attributed
it 
to hopelessness about their own economic well-being.  I think people are
hopeless 
about being heard and being understood and just having a voice.  And I
agree with you that it's not only the victimized, but many elements of
society, that are feeling unheard.
<p>
JAY ROSEN:  Well, a couple of points.  First of all, we're going to
discover part of the problem we're up against when we see how this event
and
this commission is interpreted in the press and how its charge, civility,
is
written about.  And I think we ought to include that as a media data into
the study, because the way in which the culture will interpret this effort
will tell us something about the problem of civility, the standing of that
word,
the way it is interpreted.  And just based on what I�ve heard already, I'm
sure it'll be, 
for example, constructed as politeness or `How can we all be nice to each
other?'
and things like that.  But that's a very important piece of data that we
have to work with.  
And as the work goes along, I think we need to learn how to incorporate
that into our
deliberations, because we're not doing this in a vacuum...
<p>
RODIN:  Right.
<p>
ROSEN:  ...even though there aren't any reporters in the room.  So that's
point number one.
<p>
Point number two is I think that one way we might be able to get into the
concept of civility and make it work for us a little bit more is to say
that
it's a form of communication that allows the possibility for further
communication and that incivility--the problem with incivility is that it
doesn't allow for that.  And it may, in fact, arise out of a situation
that
several people have already said, where there doesn't seem to be any
possibility for communication in the first place and so you are uncivil.
But
one way to identify an uncivil communication is that there's no saving
remnant in there.  There's nothing left that would allow for further
discussion.  And that certainly is a stronger notion than politeness or
being
nice, etc.
<p>
Finally, third point is that I'm working with journalists who are,
themselves,
concerned about this problem and starting to ask themselves similar kinds
of
questions that we're asking about their own work.  One thing they've
discovered--and this goes to the good news side of it--is that when they
begin
to grapple with this problem and their own contribution to it, their work
changes and their satisfaction in their work grows.  And that is
something we need to think about, because to the degree that all kinds of
professions are involved in civility, which there are, and occupational
groups, which there are, there is a rediscovery of certain ideals that
brought them into their work in the first place when they begin to tackle
this
problem.  And so maybe that's one thing we can think about.  There's an
incentive, in a sense, to discover more meaning in your work and to
reconnect
yourself to the reasons why you started to do what you do in the first
place,
in my own work, journalism.  But I think it would apply to lots of other
professions as well.
<p>
RODIN:  That's very important.  Yes.
<p>
EDNA ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  Yeah, if I may--does this work?
<p>
RODIN:  It does.
<p>
ULMMANN- MARGALIT:  If I may inject another voice or view from outside, I
guess
my first point is kind of good news for you guys, and that is that it
can be very, very much worse.  And I come from a society, a culture, I
come
from Jerusalem, from Israel, which considers itself a kind of Western
country, but everyone who comes from our country to this country is
immediately struck by how civil everything here is.  And that includes
talk
shows, daytime television, all the things you talked about, including
demonstrations and, of course, performances on the Senate floor and the
Congress.
<p>
So it can be very, very much different and very, very much worse.  And, of
course, it's an interesting question:  Why and what makes it so much
worse, you know, 
the political scene in my country and the level of verbal violence, of
acrimony 
of incivility is just really not to be compared to what the current worry
here seems
to be about.  And one of the interesting things is that when civility is a
topic which is discussed in our society, it's treated and taken as a
luxury.  Civility is for people who
don't have real problems, real serious problems.  They can indulge and
worry
about civil debate, and it's almost a feeling that civility's opposed to
seriousness.
<p>
Maybe it is politeness, maybe it's not.  I'm not sure.  It  goes all the
way, but when serious issues, life and death issues, are on the table,
then we can't afford to be civil, because it's much more serious than
that.
<p>
And I think, just one more point, is that there were words mentioned here
about
intolerance and polarization.  And I would like to add another word here,
which is delegitimization.  And I think that incivility or serious
incivility gets into play when the position of the other person is not
just maybe false but delegitimate or illegitimate.  And this is where
things
become really bad and dangerous, and you have mentioned yourself what has
happened in my country just in the last year.  And it's a big question
whether it's just a continuation of incivility--verbal incivility in other
means, this political murder, 
or is it something completely different?  It's not so clear that it is all
that completely
different.  So we see the limits of where it could lead, where it can lead
to.
<p>
So just one last thing that connects with what you were saying before
about Northern Ireland.  I'm extremely struck by the fact that people can
murder each other and yet be polite and civil in their debate.  I think
maybe one of the interesting things we can do here is some kind of a study
of comparative civility or incivility in different societies and how
really do serious or less serious political and social debates work
themselves out on a scale of civility and incivility.
<p>
RODIN:  Hmm.  Very important.
<p>
ULMMANN- MARGALIT:  Sure.
<p>
DREW FAUST:  It seems to me there's a theme here that's very striking,
which is that the civil are the empowered and the empowered in a variety
of
ways--empowered in terms of kind of cultural capital, empowered in terms
of
economic capital, empowered in terms of the luxury to not feel desperate
at any particular moment.  And in the language that everyone's using, I
see another 
kind of theme that I'd just like to interject, which is I'm hearing the
language of voices 
used metaphorically.  And I think it's interesting  to look at what Judy
presented to us 
and see how many different kinds of speaking we have seen here, that we
are people 
who feel most comfortable defending ourselves with words.  And we're all
trained to do that.  We're intellectuals.  We're very good at that.  And
we want perhaps to move others into that realm of intellectual debate who
do not feel so comfortable there.
<p>
Don Imus, presumably, has a different way of using words.  Rap musicians
find
music as their medium of expression.  Roberto Alomar, who, rumor has it,
was
insulted by the umpire before he spat in his face, with an ethnic slur,
found
his response, his language to be that of saliva.  And so I think we need
to
think about how people are able to speak and the very nature of what your
tools or weapons of discourse are, and that part of what goes on, I think,
in
the privileging of civility.  When you said, `What are the press going
to say about us?' it makes me nervous to think some of the attacks on
civility
as the new emblem of the elite.  And certainly it's something for the
intellectual elite to define themselves in terms of, because of this skill
we
have at intellectual rational discourse.  So I'd just like us to think
about
these different languages in which people are compelled or feel most
comfortable expressing themselves and to recognize that discourse has to
recognize those conflicts and contrasts in our voices.  They're not all in
words.
<p>
ANDRAS SAJO:  Coming from Central Europe, I think I have to start
with a quotation from Sigmund Freud, and these will not be very polite, or
civilized, if you want, given our common task.  Now the quotation is as
follows, "Civilization which asks about its own meaning is sick." Now my
question is the following:  What are the limits of uncivility, and when is
this something very different?  Coming from Europe and even having
experience in Russia, I find it always quite problematic when, on the one
hand, I see problems of new voices and incivility in the same category.
<p>
Sometimes it's absolutely true, but the real question is:  How long is
incivility simply an unavoidable new voice and when is a new voice
something
that undermines society?  And I think there is one answer.  It's a Kantian
answer.  What if the new--if the message in the new voice, liquido,
becomes
universalized?  Everything which results in the total destruction of a
society 
being universalized is not simply a matter of uncivility.  It's
unacceptable.  
Uncivility, however, can be accepted.  Indeed, the story of civilization
is 
about accommodating these acceptable new voices, which were not
acceptable, 
as we've seen in the suffrage question and the demonstration in front of
the White House.
<p>
So--or look at tennis because this is related to what we have seen with
the
umpire spitting.  It was a major scandal when people dressed in a new way
in
the tennis skirt when people came out in shorts.  That was the end
of tennis.  That was the general comment to that.  Tennis survived.  There
was
a general outcry, but they introduced new rackets in tennis.  The game was
completely different after that.  That was the end of tennis.  That was
the
general reaction to that.  It was possible to accommodate both into
tennis,
although slightly different as it was, I'd say, in the turn of the
century.
But the question or the dividing line, I think, is the possibility of
accommodation vs. generalizing it and destroying society.
<p>
JAMES FISHKIN:  I think the end of tennis was when--Was it Monica Seles
who was stabbed?  That is, the rivalry in the culture of sports fans so
that the sports fan of one tennis player would stab another, that
was the culture of incivility.  Now why are we interested in civility?
I think I'm interested in civility because I think it's the condition for
a
certain kind of self-understanding, public dialogue, functioning of our
democratic institutions, which is why I think, in contrast to what was
just
said, that a society that examines its own meaning makes possible a kind
of
self-reflective collective understanding of what it's about.  And so it's
not an indication of sickness.  It's an ailing indication of hope.
<p>
Now what kind of dialogue does it make possible--civility?  Civility makes
possible substantive dialogue.  I think of it as deliberation and mutual
understanding in a context of mutual respect.  And when the mutual respect
breaks down, the opportunity to listen to the substance also disappears,
so people
just trade insults rather than any serious discussion of our collective
alternatives.
<p>
Now I was struck by your presentation and agree with a great deal
of it, particularly the implicit message that the media has created many
incentives for our insulting each other rather than understanding each
other.
And so I think a key area of possible reflection reform is in the role of
the
media, and you have great people here.  You have Kathleen and you
have Jay Rosen, who's been leading the civic journalism movement.  And I
think
that to try to ... the media operates the way it does, quite
understandably,
because we have handed over our public dialogue almost entirely to market
incentives.  And the insults sell, and, in other
areas of life, while it's not fashionable to talk about a welfare state,
we
place limits on the market.
<p>
We don't have a pure market society.  We place limits on it.  But here
we're tending 
towards the only ultimate justification for what's done is that it sells.
So I think we need to think [of]one of the areas is the reform of the
media.
<p>
Now sometimes the way it works, you know there is communication.  There is
information communicated by insults.  I thought when Bob Beckel complained
about the welfare reform,
he was conveying information.  The trouble is there's an incentive for
strategically incomplete information.  There's not real dialogue or real
deliberation.  You don't get a full picture of the
policy alternatives and the trade-offs.  You get statements that are made
for effect in order to create a sound bite or the equivalent of a sound
bite in that show is referred to by some friends of mine in the media as
the food fight gang or, you know...
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm.  That's...
<p>
FISHKIN:  And that's pretty much what it is.  So if we can get beyond a
food fight but to an occasion where we can share something substantive to
consume together, I mean, that' the secret.  But because it goes right to
the foundations of a market society, the  problem is very fundamental, and
deep.  And it seems to me that we may come up with some useful things, but
we're not going to solve it.
<p>
RODIN:  That's why I wanted to emphasize the antithesis to this sound
bite is reason-giving...
<p>
FISHKIN:  Yes.
<p>
RODIN:  ...complex discourse.  It is true, and I agree with Drew that
there are those who lack those skills and that we need to find ways to
provide, because regardless of one's ability to use rhetoric effectively,
I think people often do think very deeply about issues that concern them,
and we have to find a mechanism for giving them voice.  But without
reasoned kind of discourse and reasoned giving and so many mechanisms in
our society are established in order to elicit reasons and then make
decisions based on them...
<p>
FISHKIN:  Right.
<p>
RODIN:  ...but this has sort of glossed over that...
<p>
FISHKIN:  Right.  But reason-giving sound bite ... reason-giving complex
discourse does not sell...
<p>
RODIN:  Right.
<p>
FISHKIN:  ...  in  a sound bite...
<p>
RODIN:  Right.
<p>
FISHKIN:  ...talk show dominated environment.
<p>
RODIN:  That's right.  Yes, I'm sorry.  Your turn next.
<p>
MICHAEL PIORE:  Well, I think I find this discussion kind of a little bit
confusing 
in the sense that it's not clear to me whether we're talking about
civility as a mean
or civility as ends.  And I think ultimately that that's part of the
problem.  I guess 
I see civility basically as a means.  And it's a means through which we
would learn to live together in a single society.  But the problem is that
basically when we're talking about civility, we're talking about the rules
of the game.  And we're trying to resolve a set of problems in which
a lot of people feel that the rules of the game are excluding them or, in
a sense, we're negotiating or talking about through a civil--what we're
calling a civil discourse the question of what the rules of the game
really are.
<p>
And since these rules are going to read some people in and some people
out, it's not easy, 
it's not obvious that we're ever going to get ultimate agreement on a set
or that we want 
agreement ultimately on the conditions of civility.  And yet to go back to
the paradox without some kind of an agreement on the rules, it seems
difficult to understand how the society is going to survive as a single
entity.
<p>
I find the question of spitting on the umpire a peculiar example in this
discussion.  It's
peculiar because what's so disturbing about spitting on the umpire is that
it's difficult 
to see how you could ever play the game if you don't have an independent
umpire.  
And yet that is an environment in which people do agree, presumably.  They
wouldn't be there if they didn't want to play the game. It's disturbing
and it seems to me in the sense that it says that incivility has extended
even into ruining the games that we all would agree to play and
in a sense to the extent that it's making baseball impossible.  It seems
to be
undermining what's left of a social consensus.
<p>
But that is not the problem which we're dealing with when we're trying to
either incorporate excluded or previously marginalized groups or
incorporate new voices, because it's not baseball.  All of those people
are people who have been excluded from the game.  And we're
really talking about what kind of game we're going to play in the society.
So whatever solution is ... that is, it's much easier to resolve the
question of the baseball umpire, it seems to me, and that solution won't
work.  It's just not the kind of solution which is going to solve the
problems which the society ... that's causing incivility in other aspects
of our social life.
<p>
RODIN:  Hmm.  Richard, you've been patient.  Please.
<p>
RICHARD LAPCHICK:  As the so-called �sports person on this commission,�
I'm
fascinated by the number of people who have commented on sports as part of
this initial presentation.  I just wanted to say what happened in my realm
of
the world--that is, the sports world--after the Roberto Alomar incident.
And
as an insider, I can tell you that there was a racial slur involved, not
that
that justifies what he did, but that should be on the table.  But the
reality
is I received 30 calls from media sources around the country within a week
after Roberto Alomar did spit on the umpire, asking me if I thought that
athletes could still be role models.
<p>
What we do is have ... train athletes to be spokespeople on the issues
that we're
talking about here and issues beyond that.  And some people think they've
been
very effective, but because of an individual athlete, particularly an
individual athlete of color, making this incident, the automatic
assumption was that he represents an athlete at the University of
Pennsylvania or any, Yale or Northeastern, where I am, or any other
school.  Roberto Alomar is an individual who took an individual act.
We're always ready to make a
generalization in this society about putting it in a broader context.  And
that was very dangerous.
<p>
And I also want to speak to the Tupac phenomenon.  I recoil when I
hear the words to the music, like most everybody else in here, but I
happen to
have been in Orlando at the NBA's rookie transition program where we do
some
programming for them with the 66 rookies this year, 56 of whom are
African-American.  And I can tell you that Tupac connected for most of
those
people, because he had said something to them that meant something in
their
lives, and they were very distressed when he died.  And I think that's
something we also have to deal with.   Some of the things that disconnect
us connect 
to other people.  And it's frequently along a racial line.
<p>
SELIGMAN:  I think there's one aspect of civility that we're, this group,
is probably comfortable being relativistic about.  And that's politeness.
When we talk about tennis shorts and that some of us use words and others
of us don't, then that's a situation in which I think the
praise of diversity is appropriate.  But I think there's another aspect of
incivility which is different from impoliteness that I suspect this group
would want to be more absolute about, that we would want to find ultimate
agreement about.  And that's that the dialogue should be subtle and
reasoned and the aspect of incivility that Judy was talking about in which
we have increased drive to simplicity and sound bite, I think is something
we don't want to be relativistic about.
<p>
I think it was Vonnegut who said that no one ever went broke
underestimating the taste of the American people.  And in our society,
it's profitable, highly reinforced to be simplistic.  We don't have too
many institutions in which subtle argument pays off.  So the aspect of
civility
cast that  I want to add to your list is subtlety and complexity, and that
we don't want to be relativistic about.
<p>
ROBERT SPILLANE:  Yes.  In my real world, which is the world of very young
people, civilities are not negotiated or emerge out of conflict.  We're
expected for our young people to have defined what's civil.  We do set
standards and we do have rights and responsibility issues, and we offer
peer mediation when young people can't get along.  But I think that
hopefully
before noontime we'll have defined for our young people in our schools
what civility is so we can take this discourse, because it always has to
be translated into a very practical implementation somewhere.  And I don't
think it is.  It's not going to be done here, I know.  And yet schools are
expected, with our young people, to make certain that those kinds of
things happen.
<p>
The Gallup polls over the last two decades have listed discipline as one
of the top, if not the top, issues with the American public.  And I
suspect most of you have had or know of children in public schools and the
issues about civility.  Usually this incivility is at the school board-
superintendent level during meetings.  But that really is an issue that I
think this group needs to deal with as well.  Can it be defined for our
young people?  Or should it be defined for our young people?
<p>
APPLEBY:  You know, we don't have to make civility the pivot...
<p>
SPILLANE:  Right.
<p>
APPLEBY:  ...of our discussions.  The commission is on society, culture
and community.  
And  I do think that we expose ourselves by using civility.   There's a
critique of civility 
as kind of an elitist concern that plays into their strengths and enables
them, again, to, you know, criticize others for not being like them, I
liked very much what Lawrence Lessig said about culture and our
understanding that culture is a dynamic process.  And you said something
that brought that again to mind when you said that there is a sense that
ordinary people
want to be heard.  They want to be understood.  They want their lives to
have meaning.
<p>
This is an incredible development.  I mean, 50 years ago, no one expected
ordinary people or anyone to have this concern about the meaning in their
lives and being heard and speaking forth.  And it's not going to be
stopped.
It's going to roll over the globe.  We're in the midst of dramatic
changes in cultural expectations, what people want out of their society.
And
I think it would be wonderful if we could, as someone up here, I thought
it
was Thomas Sugrue but maybe it was Claude Steele, said that we should get
a  concern with developing a map of the causes of change, not the causes
of incivility,
but just of change so that we could understand what is abrading us when it
does and 
where the, you know, the good and the bad is.  But I would love to see us
drop civility. 
I mean, we've exhausted, mentioned things about it, but this is a
commission
on society, culture and community, and those are categories, I think, that
have a great deal more promise.
<p>
RODIN:  All right.
<p>
LESSIG:  I wanted to say I wanted to advance the cause of incivility, but
I want to take the suggestion of Professor Appleby and suggest we move
beyond that.  But, I want to make a distinction.  The distinction is
between how we see the world and the stuff that we argue about.  And I
wanted to use that distinction to suggest that there are places where,
obviously,
incivility helps.  It doesn't help in the context of things that we're
arguing about, contested matters that we all understand we've got to come
to some agreement about.
<p>
But where incivility has helped in the past is in the areas of, the
category of the way we see the world, because what incivility does is it
gets us to see the world differently.  And your
wonderful image of the suffragettes marching at the White House, that was
plainly incivility.  Its purpose was to change the way people saw the
world.  Now we can redefine civility.  And Professor Gutmann suggested
that we redefine civility such that that wouldn't be civility is a project
which I think is fine, but I want to just say locally this was an action
which was seen to be improper and criticized for that, not because ...
wasn't criticized because the ideas of
equality were wrong.  That wasn't the way it was criticized.  It was
criticized as �this is the wrong way to advance these ideas, right?�
<p>
Now arguments about equality for women had been bouncing around in
American
culture for a long time.  And what was necessary here was an action that
changed the nature of how these ideas were registering, an action which
got
people to see them, to see that they were about us seeing the world
differently, because we now see the world differently.  We see the world
such
that it's, of course, obvious, that blah, blah, blah.  It's obvious that
women
are part of discourse.  It's obvious that race shouldn't matter in the
nature
of the discourse.
<p>
But there were times, of course, where the way the world was seen didn't
include those bits of cognitive truism.  And right now what are the useful
types 
of incivility that we could think about right now?  It is, again, the
kinds of incivility 
that changes the way things are ordinarily seen.  For example, when people
say 
that it's uncivil or there's something improper about gay rights activists
quote, "parading"
their sexual orientation before other people, well, you know, what is in
that
statement, `parading their sexual orientation'--as if heterosexuality is
not,
quote, "paraded" before people all the time.  I mean, the point is the
this type of action 
has an effect, which is, I want to suggest, different from the type of
effect we have in ordinary political discourse.  It has an effect on how
people are understanding things that were
before taken for granted.
<p>
Now that's the sense in which it's about reconstructing a culture.  It's
where a culture is used in the sense of how we ordinarily see the world.  
It's a tool for throwing into the foreground these
ideas that were before in the background as a way to remake something
about
culture that you don't like.  No, it's a choice.  You've got to say you
don't like this aspect of the culture.  And there's obviously, there's
nothing, there's no neutrality either in civility or in incivility.  But
it's
a means for recreating the way we see the world, right?  And this is an
advance in many ways.  I think that's Professor Appleby's suggestion.
It's an
advance that we're seeing the world differently.  And the question is:
What
are the techniques that get us to see the world differently?
<p>
VERKUIL:  I agree that we could free ourselves from the limitations of the
word
 `civility' when we're talking about civilization, and  it has a much
larger sense and scope 
than ... We  shouldn't be constrained by that word, which has pejorative
and limiting
limitations.
<p>
But you tried to make, Judy, I think, the need for having a voice as
producing 
incivil or uncivil dimensions.  And then I think I come back to a paradox, 
which is that if the need to have a voice produces a lot of the tensions
and 
the disagreements that we have, then why don't we use the systems that we
have 
available for voices to be heard?
<p>
I don't think we've ever been in a worse state in terms of political
dimensions.  The voting percentages are at an all-time low.  And yet, we
all
assume--I mean, we come into this thing ... you know, we're sitting here
in
Philadelphia, after all, where this whole experiment began, with the
notion
that representative government is the greatest institution, and Eastern
Europe admires it and Israel and other countries of the world, I'm
sure, sitting here doing it, but yet, we don't practice it for some
reason.
And the voicelessness is not satisfied by the representative forms of
government, which we accept.  So that pulls me into a paradox that I don't
know where to go, other than to say that that should be central to trying
to
give people a voice.
<p>
The other thing I wondered about is Freud, actually, if--did Freud really
say
that civilization which asks about its own meaning is sick?  Then it
must be true that any individual which asks about his or her own meaning
is ... 
Must be.  Well, we're all sick.  That's
good.
<p>
GUTMANN:  OK.
<p>
Unidentifiable:  Freud did say that.
<p>
GUTMANN:  I think whether we want to focus as much as we have on
civility or not is quite open, and no term is going to do all the work for
us,
whether it be civility or culture or society.  So we're better off just
getting on with arguments.  And the one thing that would make me
uncomfortable
about this commission is if we didn't argue with one another but all came
to
some kind of mushy agreement, not that agreements are always mushy, but
in the case of the diverse voices around these tables, it would be mushy
if we
all agreed.  So let me disagree with a few things.
<p>
One is that I really find it hard to think about how a paradigm case of
civil
disobedience should be called, you know, a case of incivility.  The
suffrage movement in the clip that we saw was a paradigm case of civil
disobedience, as was Martin Luther King.  It's not reinventing or
redefining
the term `civility.'  It is part of our tradition to value civil
disobedience.
Now there was great disagreement as to whether that was justified, but it
certainly was civil disobedience.
<p>
There are some times when uncivil disobedience is justified.  I happen to
think going to war against slavery was a justified response to the heinous
moral crime of slavery.  The Civil War was not a case of people
being civil to one another, but the suffragettes were engaging in civil
disobedience.
<p>
Secondly, the idea that the civil are the empowered, I think is belied by
Edna
Ulmmann-Margalit's example of Israel.  The uncivil in Israel are
empowered.
Many of them are empowered.  There are many people who are engaging in
totally
disrespectful, cutting off of not only the conversation but cutting off of
the
integration and the respect for the disempowered in this country who are
uncivil.  So while we might actually want to excuse, if not justify,
certain
forms of incivility when engaged in by the disempowered, we should not
identify incivility or disrespect or cutting off of people from the
conversation with being disempowered.
<p>
If we can't see it at home, it's very helpful to have people from Ireland
and Israel here 
with us to indicate that there's something of value for at least the
empowered to be civil and respectful to those who have not yet been given
the kinds of rights and sometimes, indeed, privileges.
<p>
And finally--just one more point--I think one of the places we've seen an
enormous rise in the last couple of decades of incivility in the sense
that I was giving it 
at least, which I think has a tradition, is the academic realm.  There is
a sense that this 
kind of forum is unusual in intellectual life these days, where people who
come from very different perspectives engage with one another.  So that's
a real value of what we're
doing, and it's a value that's become, to some extent, devalued in
intellectual life, where sound bites also often pay off, and that's a real
corruption of intellectual life, I think, quite apart from the corruption
of democracy that would happen if the empowered don't try to address
the claims of the disempowered or sometimes the claims of other people
who are empowered on terms that are potentially mutually acceptable.
<p>
I don't see how we can go on, and this is a sense in which I think
civility
or mutual respect as I usually call it and Jim Fishkin,  is an end as well
as a means.  
That is, it helps us live with our disagreements, and it also gives us
potentially a way 
of finding some common ground.  So I would say it has this dual function.  
And both of those are valuable.  And sometimes before we can actually see
it pay off,
we benefit from it as a means.  It gives us hope that we might be able to
come to some better
agreement, some more common ground than we have at the moment.
<p>
RODIN:  OK.  Cass
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jim and Amy are talking about a
conception of democracy--the deliberative conception of democracy, and
maybe
it will be good to get that on the table.  If we had a conception of
democracy
that's deliberate, it would have two minimal commitments.  One is to
political
equality and another is to reason giving in the public domain.  And we
might
be able to rescue the notion of civility as a democratic ideal by saying
that
incivility understood through that deliberative lens would be either, in
Jay
Rosen's term, an effort to close off further discussion.  Spitting does
that;
protesting certainly doesn't.  Protesting is, in a way, an invitation to
further discussion or something that in Edna Ullman-Margalit's
term �delegitimates� a view, rules it off the agenda or off the table
rather than claiming it incorrect just to be incorrect.
<p>
Now that understanding of incivility would say incivility is a public vice
when it rejects the commitment to political equality and reason giving.
And
then we would say Martin Luther King didn't exhibit incivility nor did the
suffragettes.  I don't think Malcolm X really did, not often.  Buchanan
and
Imus did in the excerpts with which we started.
<p>
And then I think that would ... there's a useful idea because the
discussion of
empowered and disempowered is really, I'm not sure I have this word right,
but
is orthogonal to the discussion of civility and incivility.  It really has
nothing to do with that.  It is true that disempowered people often are
very
angry, but they aren't, they don't violate, they aren't exhibiting the
public vice of incivility or at least when they are, we should complain.
<p>
RODIN:  Michael.
<p>
USEEM:  I would like to go back and really pick it up on this last
comment,
get us back to Joyce's suggestion, which is that we move away from
civility as
such.  Let me just offer a couple of pointers on the directions we
might take.  We think about the charge here of the commission to think
about
society and community.  From the last 45 minutes of discussion, it's
evident
that incivility makes it difficult to reach decisions.  If you think about
uncivil behavior within a university or a public school system or a
foundation
or a company, it makes for suboptimal decision making.  You're not
getting information flowing the way it ought to.  And you could make the
same
argument for American society.  When people are uncivil in dialogue, it
really
cuts information out of the exchange.
<p>
So in that sense, the theme that at least at this point is in my mind on
this specific issue 
is it's not civility as such but forms of dialogue and discourse that
prevent us from thinking through solutions to problems on society and
culture.
<p>
The two other things I would add, just to get them on the table here,
would
be, number two, issues of inequity and injustice.  It sort of has been a
subtheme in many of the comments.  And maybe the number three are the
factors--that's kind of vaguely put, but the problems that seem to
persist in many institutions that make it difficult for good leadership to
emerge.  So leadership, discourse and inequity would be my three factors.
<p>
RODIN:  I think that's critical.  I did try to point out in my opening
comments that I think we are short of leaders.  Paul indicated that people
weren't voting.  I think they're not voting for the people who are
running, but they still seek leadership.  And they're looking to other
avenues
for the kind of leadership that is being sought and not finding any.  And
so the question of how one becomes a leader when all of the leadership
skills that many people thought they had are often those that aren't
considered that valuable in this current discourse, either by its
nature or the level of extremism that seems to be pervasive.  The issue of
leadership I do hope we'll come back to.  Derek.
<p>
DEREK BOK:  I just wanted to follow up on that.  What is the evidence that
the quality of leadership has diminished?  And what could the possible
explanation could there be for it diminishing?  I mean, you hear
constantly
that leadership in our corporations are gone.  Who knows who's head of a
corporation?  Leadership in our universities certainly disappeared after
Robert Hutchins, who was the last really visible campus leader.  And you
can
go on through American institutions that way.
<p>
Now politics, I, for one, for example, don't believe that the quality of
people in terms of their education, intelligence, commitment to public
life
has diminished.  I would rather argue that it's increased in public life.
But,
if some quality of leadership is  missing, what could explain its absence 
in all these fields?  I mean, it can't be something that happened in the
gene pool.  
There must be something in our society and there's no evidence that the
talent 
of people in leadership positions is diminishing.  So there must be
something 
in the atmosphere that is inhibiting people who are otherwise talented 
in positions of authority from exercising some kind of quality that we
wished they had.
<p>
Now what is the quality that they are not exhibiting?  And what cultural
force 
would there possibly be which is preventing them from behaving in the
fashion 
that we would like them to behave?
<p>
RODIN:  Go ahead.
<p>
ANTHONY APPIAH:  Well, it seems to me that one possible answer to that
is connected with what we've already been talking about, the growth of the
sense 
that everybody has a right to voice and the growth.  In other words, of
powerful 
notions of political equality.  A lot of the sense that people used to
have of the 
success of leaders depended upon massive patterns of deference, a great
deal 
of kind of public conspiracy in order to construct their image and so on,
all sorts 
of things that have been undermined by the great expansion of the
democratic spirit.
<p>
And that's just a way of segueing into what I was planning to say when I
first put my hand up, which is connected.  But I think it would be useful,
as Amy said, to keep lots of terms in play, and in the
same spirit of wanting to avoid premature agreement, let me just say
something
about voice as a concept which has on the whole been used in a way that
civility started out being used, that is, as a good thing, and just say
that
as with civility, we can ask questions about voice like, `Are we thinking
of
this as a means or as an end?'  We've talked about it in both ways.  We've
talked about the idea of voice as a way of expressing respect of people,
that
is, allowing someone a voice as a way of respecting people; giving them
voice
as a way of respecting them.  We've also talked about voice as among the
disenfranchised, which is, in part, about getting what you want.  It's
about
seeking political ends by having representation, by having people hear
what
you have to say and take account of it and have to take account of it and
so as we're shifting the allocation of rights or of resources in your
direction.
<p>
It seems to me that one of the great, and this is a perfectly familiar
point, but one of the great things that goes with this modern upsurge in
the democratic spirit is the idea that, you know, Charles Taylor, has
called the politics of the--of--What was it called?--the politics of...
<p>
RODIN:  Over there.
<p>
GUTMANN:  Recognition.
<p>
APPIAH:  ... recognition.  Thank you.  That was the word I was looking
for.
Amy knows because she made me write something in a book about it.  In the
politics of recognition, it is sort of the idea that increasingly people
want to be 
recognized in the public sphere and by the state in particular and then we
have 
a whole list of sort of categories under which we want to be recognized:
racial
 categories, gender categories, sexuality, nationality and so on.
<p>
Well, I'd like to say that as an end, that is, as something to
pursue, it seems to me less clear than everybody else, perhaps, thinks
that
this is such a great thing.  And let me put it in this way:  It seems to
me that some of these questions about recognition require us to make a
distinction that we haven't been making much between the political and the
social.  I think that a lot of the seeking for voice that we hear around
us is seeking for recognition from--not from each other--not as fellow
citizens, in the sense of people who are members of the same political
institution, members of the same state, but as members of the same
society,
which is very much not the same thing.
<p>
And I would think that some of what people are worried about when they
talk
about incivility needs to be seen away from the political, needs to be
seen in
the public behavior, the way people behave in trains and subways and on
the streets and as drivers and so on.  These are behaviors which reflect,
I would say, an inadequate
concern for others, which is a vice, and we need to think about the social
origins of that inadequate concern for others.
<p>
But these are not political problems and I think that inadequate concern
for others does, 
then, it�s true, show up in the political sphere as well, but it's not by
any means
limited to political.  We've been talking, I think, about politics all the
time, and I think we need to bear in mind that the word `society' is in
our ... and the words `society' and `community' are in our charge, and
that that's not simply a matter of the political.
<p>
RODIN:  No.  David, you were waiting.
<p>
BROMWICH:  Most of what I wanted to say has been said by Gutmann and
Appiah. 
I guess it was only not to prejudice the discussion by having it be about
anything
civility, exclusively politics.  It seemed to me there's another drift
from two or three 
speakers to make it about the empowered vs. the disempowered; the
disempowered and voice seem to go together, but lest we assume that those
are good things.  I mean, you know,
it doesn't seem to me, in fact, the very first moment in history where
there's
been a strong upsurge of the formerly voiceless.
<p>
Early Christianity was such a moment, if we can trust Gibbon, and I think
I
can hear it in Corinthians.  Fascism was such a moment.  I don't mean to
say
that I'm on the side of both or either of those phenomena, but to say that
it
is the disempowered says nothing about it.  To say that it is the
taken-for-granted culture says nothing about it.  It may be good; it may
be
bad.  I can tell already that my picture of the authority wielded by many
kinds of umpires in our taken-for-granted culture right now differs
greatly
from Professor Lessig's.  His seems, to me, to come from many years ago,
but
perhaps it's different in the different places we live.
<p>
But I think, you know, we have to qualify and sharpen the exact purpose of
our remarks 
without trying to exclude or eminently include certain things in the
discussion.  Words can 
only mean a certain amount.  I mean, I feel I have to say this as an
English teacher.  If you want to talk about civility, you can't eminently
exclude politeness.
<p>
It isn't all just sweet talk.  That isn't all civility is about.  And I
agree
with Amy Gutmann that Martin Luther King's civil disobedience and the
marching of the Suffragettes outside the White House could easily qualify
as
civil acts.  But you can't say it may be a good thing and have nothing to
do 
with politeness.  No, it can't.  Words mean certain things, then try
another word, 
so that's my umpire ground rule.
<p>
WIEBE:  You encouraged some of us to talk history, and as an historian, 
I'm delighted to do that.  I just wanted to use American history in regard 
to two matters that have been brought up.  One is the question of the
decline 
in leadership.  At least from the early 19th century, there has been a
steady 
lament that leaders aren't what they used to be.
<p>
And those of you who know Toqueville's Democracy in America will pick up
on
one of the early `Oh, my, the Founding Fathers are dead.  What will we do
now?'  And it goes on.  Lincoln was certainly a disaster at the time of
his
election.  You know, `Where is Clay and Webster and Calhoun when we need
the
great leaders?'  And, `Here's this hick from the Midwest.'  And on and on
it
goes.
<p>
To this very day, whether from the left or from the right, I read in The
Nation this extraordinary glorification of Franklin D. Roosevelt, as if he
is
somehow or another the leader we now want to have revived in our own time,
a
profoundly conservative man.  I think we should be very cautious in sort
of
picking up on a theme that I'll call historical mugwumpism, a kind of
elite
concern that people aren't as sort of as pure as they used to be, that we
are
in a declining civilization and leadership is an index to that.
<p>
The second is to exalt something called reason.  Historically, those
people
who have talked the most about reason in public affairs have also been a
highly privileged group who have used their version of reason as a way of
excluding the voices or the participation of large portions of a
population; I
think, in particular, of the use of reason as a weapon against emerging
labor
groups and labor voices and labor unions as unreasonable, as class-biased, 
as not deliberative or dispassionate.  But it's not just to exclude labor
groups, 
historically, but many, many other groups were considered unreasonable 
in the way in which they participated in public life.
<p>
And in that regard I'd like to bring back Tom Bender's concern about
powerlessness as a general issue.  I think, in fact, the issue of
inclusion, 
of a sense of inclusion, of participation, is absolutely critical to
everything
we're doing in this meeting.
<p>
RODIN:  I'm going to stop us, I think, in the interest of time, and we'll
pick up with Tom.  And I apologize to those of you that I didn't get to,
but we will have a great deal of time, I think, for continuing
conversation,
and we can hear from the conversation, certainly, not a lack of exciting
and
interesting ideas and discourse.
<p>
I'd like to introduce the commission's staff to you:  Cheryl Faulkner.
Many of you 
have met her already, I'm sure, she's been so helpful in bringing us all
together; 
Michael Strong, a doctoral candidate in comparative literature at Penn.
He will be 
coordinating all of the technological support for the commission,
developing our planned Web site. And it is one of the wonderful ironies of
the University of Pennsylvania
that all of the interest in technology began in the humanities and in
English
and history, and all of the expertise still resides there.  So, Michael,
thank
you.
<p>
And we'll use, extensively, many interactive technologies to expand our
discussion and to include others in our conversation beyond the commission
meetings.  Dr. William Boltz--Bill--he's just joined us as the associate
director of the commission, from the University of Chicago; and Stephen
Steinberg, the commission's executive director, whom I think many of you
have
met.  And everyone stands ready to help your two days be easier in any
way.  I
think we've set out a computer outside, and there are a variety of things
we're just...
<p>
STEPHEN STEINBERG:  They can check their e-mail from it.
<p>
RODIN:  You can check your e-mail from here and a variety of other things.
Let me just say one word about lunch:  We're moving across Sansom Street,
the
small street that fronts the law school and having lunch at the White Dog
Cafe. 
I wanted to do that rather than have us meeting here and you'll have table
numbers, 
I think, are assigned and in your binders.  We're trying to mix people up 
during the course of the day and the evening, so forgive us for assigning
tables to you.
<p>
The White Dog Cafe is locally famous in Philadelphia, not only because it
has
very inventive cuisine, which it does, but it's a restaurant and an owner
that
has really committed itself to social activism and to the life of the
community.  Judy Wicks has spent most of her life in community activism,
and
I know she'll come over to greet us.  And the White Dog is the setting for
many of our community events.  There are always talks by local politicians
and
community activists; Penn faculty gathered there to celebrate Gandhi's
birthday; 
a Native American Thanksgiving dinner was celebrated there; and weekly,
they 
have parties for Rollerblading for the over-40, which I greatly
appreciate.  It's a 
funky sort of place.  We hope it will stimulate your palate and your
intellect.
<p>
The name The White Dog Cafe derives from Madame Helena Blavatsky, who was
the founder of the Theosophical Society, who lived in that building in
1875.
It is said that she was diagnosed as having a very badly infected leg, and
the doctors ordered amputation.  She refused and slept each night with a
white
dog spread across her leg.  And the infection receded and she healed and
went
on to do some more wonderful things.
<p>
Please enjoy your lunch and we'll see you when you return. <p>
