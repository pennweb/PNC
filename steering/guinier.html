LANI GUINIER:  I'm delighted, actually, to follow the historical
narrative with a more particular narrative, and I'm delighted to follow
the
historical narrative with a more particular narrative that takes place in
this
law school, because part of what I would like to add to what we've already
heard is the role of lawyers and legal culture in framing public
discourse.
<p>
And I'd like to start, actually, from a vision.  That is, I'd like to
start
from a class that takes place in this law school that is co-taught by
Professor Susan Sterm and myself.  It's a class on race and gender.  It's
a
class of 20 students who must apply to be admitted.  It is an
extraordinarily
diverse class.  We just finished teaching this class last Wednesday and
the
last class, as is our tradition, takes place at my house.  And although
the
class is supposed to take two hours, they didn't leave my house--they came
at
5 and they didn't leave my house until almost 11, which is typical of this
class.  And I think in part the fact that the students don't want to leave
the
class is one of the most important virtues and one of the most important
markers of the success of this class.  And I think if we're going to start
from a positive vision, that is:  What would public discourse--what would
a
group of people committed to working together and trying to solve public
problems look like and how would we know it when we saw it?
<p>
One of the first things I think we would see is sustained communication
and a
desire to continue the conversation so that the mark of a successful
conversation, the mark of successful public discourse, is a commitment to
come
back.  It is not something that you can measure simply by an outcome, it
is
really a commitment to a process.  And the fact that these students didn't
want to leave my house, even though one of them had an exam the very next
day,
which probably doesn't speak too well of my priorities or hers, but the
fact
that they didn't want to leave my house, and the fact that as we went
around
the room and asked everyone to debrief--and this, again, was another
innovation.  Most of the time in law school classes when people do
debriefing
and give faculty an evaluation, they do it anonymously.  They do it on a
piece
of paper and they don't give the feedback face-to-face.  This was a public
debriefing in that everyone went around the room and described what it is
that
they most valued about the class.
<p>
And in that debriefing, several of the students said, `This is a class
that
reminded me why I went to law school.  This is a class that restored my
sense
of self.  This is a class that gave me back the private space to be who I
am.'
And, `This is a class which I hope I will be able to continue having
contact
with even after today is over.'  That is, `I know that 20 years from now
when
I'm having a problem in my law practice, I will be able to call one of the
members of this class up and we will be able to brainstorm together.'
<p>
Now what is most amazing about these sentiments is that this is a class,
as I said, that is enormously diverse.  There were four black students in
the
class, including one who described herself as a black nationalist.  There
were
four Asian students.  There were two East Indian students.  There were
three
Latinos.  There were seven whites, including three Jewish students, one of
whom is Orthodox.  So this is a very diverse group of people, and they
said
this now was their friends.  These were people that they had learned
to respect as a result of coming together. <p>

Now how did we make this diverse group of students feel like friends?  And
Susan Sterm and I are lawyers.  We're law professors.  We are
not historians, we are not philosophers, we are not sociologists.  But one
of
the things that I think we did that is most important, not just in terms
of
having the class and providing space for this class, but we turned over
responsibility for conducting the class to the students.  And I think this
is
a very important aspect of positive or affirmative vision, going back to
the
critique of expertise, the critique of elitism and the notion that
part of the problem with our present public discourse is a sense that
there
are people in charge who are those with the knowledge and the information
who
are going to fix things and then the rest of us sit around and observe
passively. [T]he rest of us are the spectators and the professors, the
governors, the people in charge are the sage on the stage.
<p>
Well, what we did in this class is we reversed that and gave most of the
power and responsibility to the students who each had to facilitate two of
the
classes.  And in their facilitation, not only did they have the
responsibility
for leading the class discussion, but they also had the opportunity--and
this
comes back to one of the last points that Tom Bender made--they had the
opportunity to work very closely with each other, because no one
facilitated
the class alone.  They were at least two and generally three students who
were
facilitating.  And in that project of having a class that they were
responsible for facilitating, they learned how to work together. <p>

They also engaged in multiple forms of participation.  This was not just
students standing up and replacing the professor and talking at another
group
of students.  They were engaged in role playing.  They had to write
reflection
pieces.  This was an opportunity for people to participate in many
different
forms and I think that's another aspect of this, quote, "affirmative
vision."
Because some people don't do very well if the only way that they can speak
is
through a performance, or where they have to speak in a very loud voice.
<p>
The other thing that we emphasized in this class was the value of
difference.
This class was on race and gender, but this was not about
transcending difference.  This was about respecting and working with
difference.  And as we went around the room and the students debriefed,
each
of them thanked all of the other students in the class for being so
different.
That is, for teaching them not only about the other students but about
themselves, for reminding them that their own perspectives were partial
and
while deeply held, did not explain the universe for everyone else in the
class.
<p>
The final thing that we did that I would like to mark or
signal as an affirmative or a positive vision is that we constructed the
class
as a problem-solving class.  We did not see this class simply as an
opportunity to talk.  This was not a class in which people simply talked
about
their personal experiences.
<p>
This was not a class in which we talked only abstractly about the
law.  This was a class in which we continuously moved from the personal to
the
abstract and then back again, all the while trying very hard to work
together
through various problems that had been put on the table as a result of the
facilitation.
<p>
Now what I'd like to do, if this class represents a positive vision, it
represents an intermediate space where people from very different
backgrounds could come together and constructively and happily work
together,
how can we strategize backwards?  How can we take that class and use it as
a
critique of what most of us do in public life?
<p>
I think if we look at that class as--or at least, for me-- a positive
vision
and then move backwards to see what is it that we're doing in our public
life
that makes it impossible for us to engage in problem solving in a way that
that class did, I think we see that it's not an accident that we're
meeting
here in the law school.  It's not an accident that we're meeting here in
the
law school, because in many ways, what legal culture has done is to
construct a very adversarial view of public conversation.  And what legal
culture has done is to provide the metaphor for much of public
conversation.  And the metaphor is that you have two opposing parties who
fight with each other but don't really interact with each other because
they
are in a courtroom in which they are fighting against each other to
impress a
third party--the judge or the referee--who then scores them;  who then
determines who has won.
<p>
And if you think about this model of truth detection as it is derived from
the
courtroom, you see a model in which people are not talking to each other,
in
which people are not trying to solve problems together, but, in fact, they
are
encouraged to perform.  This is what my colleague calls the gladiator
phenomena.
<p>
And when we think about public conversation as a performance, in that
gladiator model, then each single event in the conversation assumes
enormous
importance.  Because each of us is being judged by our performance.  And
as a
result, many people fear speaking aloud, or when they do speak aloud,
they're
not speaking to anyone but the group or the side that they are already
working
with or associated with.  When they speak aloud, they are speaking not to
resolve a problem but to win because, again, this is all about
gamesmanship.
And the focus is not on the process.  The focus is not, was this a
successful
conversation?  Do we want to continue this conversation?  The focus is
exclusively on the outcome.  Who won this conversation and who lost?  And
in
that process, we discourage people from wanting to come back.
<p>
And so, again, looking at the class as the model of a successful
conversation--meaning a conversation that we want to continue--most public
conversation is a disaster, because we do not want it to continue.  Those
of
us who have been exposed to public conversation are happiest when we are
far
away from it.
<p>
Now I don't mean to say that the adversarial model is the exclusive
culprit
here, and I think that the media reinforces much of what is wrong with the
adversarial truth-detection model.  As Cornell West and Michael Lerner
described the role of the media in an article they wrote, ÒJews and Blacks
and Dialogue,Ó they say, `The media consistently attempts,' and I quote,
"to
fit our public dialogue into its own master discourse that highlights the
tensions and underplays the solidarity." And again, this is an ironic
confluence where the media, the journalists and the lawyers are coming
together to create a dramatic moment and they are coming
together but the rest of us are coming apart, because they are each
focusing
on identifying the opposing sides to a conflict and they are both arriving
at
the same destination, which essentially is a ritualized contest
between dichotomized and individualized positions.
<p>
Now there are other ways in which adversarial or legal models of problem
solving have infiltrated our public culture to our detriment.  Tom Bender
talked about the role of experts.  I think lawyers reinforce that notion
that
there's a hierarchy and that the lawyers are the only ones who are allowed
to
speak and everyone else is supposed to listen or watch.  Lawyers and legal
culture tends to emphasize that there is a universal, a single standard,
the
law, by which everyone must be judged and as a result it de-emphasizes or
minimizes the role of context, which is often very important in terms of
trying to resolve various problems.  And in this case, race is a very good
example of the problem of using a universal or single standard to try and
resolve problems, because we tend to think of race in public as a binary
category.  You're either black or you're white; you're either a racist or
you're not a racist.
<p>
Race is a much more fluid and much more complicated and much more nuanced
issue.  And let me just give you an example of this, again, coming from
the
class.  There was a young woman in the class who was objecting to the
conversation about race because she is a Jewish student and she felt that
when
we were talking about race we should also be talking about Jews, because
for
her, being Jewish was a race.  And so this created a very interesting
conversation among many of the Jewish students in the class, whether they
agreed with her that being Jewish was a race.  And then one of the
students
said, `Well, when you're talking about being a race, do you mean that you
agree with some of the callers who call up the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in
New
York and when they're asked to report on a particular discrimination
problem,
they say, "Was your employer black or white."  And some of them say, "No,
neither.  They were Jewish."  Is that what you mean by saying, "Being
Jewish
is a race?"'  And the woman said, `Oh, absolutely not.'  That's not what
she
meant.
<p>
What she was trying to do was to introduce a nuance into the conversation
without being trapped into a binary category.  And part of the problem
with
our public conversation about race is that we don't allow people to do
that.
If she is going to say being Jewish is a race, then it must be a race for
all
times and in all cases.  And so part of the challenge is to figure out
ways in
which we can talk about something as complicated and as contextualized as
race
without being trapped into a universal or one-size-fits-all standard.
<p>
Now the other problem with talking or using the adversarial model in
public
conversation is that, again, one size fits all and a universal standard
suggests that fault or blame are the only ways in which we can assess
public
conversation about race.  They are the currency of moral authority:  Fault
or
blame.  Again, that's the imposition of this adversarial metaphor.
<p>
And so an individual who is talking about race is either a good guy or a
bad
guy.  They're either responsible for all of the problems of the world or
they're innocent of all of the problems of the world.  And we don't see
issues
of race as having a class dimension, as having a gender dimension, as
having a
systemic dimension.  It's all individualized and it's all as if this were
a
criminal case.  And when someone speaks and they make a mistake or they
speak
out of turn, then we have to put them on trial.  We indict them and we
have to
prosecute them.  We bring in character witnesses and we have to
determine whether in fact they can be absolved of their racial fault.  And
the
naming and then blaming framework simply increases the risk of speaking
out
publicly.  And as a result, people are afraid to talk out loud about
issues
such as race.
<p>
Well, let me just conclude by coming back to the class and suggesting a
way in
which this class is able to solve a problem using a very different,
less-polarized, less-adversarial model and not simply talking about race
in a
crisis situation and not simply talking about race through a
one-size-fits-all
lens.  And the contrast is the case of Lowell High School in
California.  And the contrast is that when I was on a book tour on talk
radio,
I got a lot of calls--and I was in San Francisco--from people who said,
`Well,
what do you think of Lowell High School?' And I had to have an
answer--Right?--because this is talk radio, this is the name and blame
game.
`Is Lowell High School right, is it wrong?  Do you side with the
Chinese-American students or with the NAACP?'
<p>
The facts of Lowell High School are that like all San Francisco public
high
schools, Lowell High School was under a consent decree to ensure that no
one
ethnic or racial group was more than 40 percent of the population at any
San
Francisco high school.  And as a result of that consent decree to
desegregate
the San Francisco schools, the school, which is a magnet public school --
it
boasts a number of distinguished alums including Stephen J. Breyer --  the
school had a test for admission--69 was a perfect score--and they were
using a
sliding scale to determine who could get in in order to maintain diversity
at
the school.  And if you were Chinese-American, initially you had to score
65
out of 69 in order to get in.  If you were Asian-American, but not
Chinese-American or you were white, you had to get 62 out of 69 in order
to
get in.  If you were African-American or Mexican-American, you had to get
a 59
out of 69 in order to get in.
<p>
So a group of Chinese-American parents intervened to try to reopen this
consent decree, saying that the sliding scale discriminated against their
children.  And a group of African-American parents and the NAACP said,
`No, if
we don't have this sliding scale, we will not have diversity at Lowell
High
School.'  And so there was a conflict between the NAACP and the
Chinese-American parents.  And that's the conflict into which I walked
when I
was on talk radio in San Francisco.
<p>
Well, my solution to that problem was to say, `I'll get back to you.' And
I
took that problem to the class on race and gender at the
University of Pennsylvania Law School.  And I said, `OK.  Here's the
problem.
I don't want an answer that tells me who's right and who's wrong.  I don't
want a vote in which we decide that the Chinese-Americans get this many
votes
and the NAACP gets that many votes.  I want us to talk about what are the
underlying assumptions behind each side's claim and how could we, if we
were
running Lowell High School, change the admissions procedure to accommodate
the
legitimate concerns of everybody on both sides of the debate, or at least
more
people on both sides of the debate.'  And we came up with some very
interesting approaches.
<p>
One of the students said, `Well, they should have a lottery.  If 59 is the
lowest score by which they admit in anybody, then take everyone with a 59
on
this test and put their names in a hat and just pull the names out of the
hat
using random selection.'  And another student said, `Well, but the school
may
have certain things that it values, not just how well you do on this
test.'
So they have a conversation and suggested if the school, in conjunction
with
the community and the alums and the present students, determines that
there
are other things that they value in addition to how you do on this test
and
those things may be as far-reaching as whether you play trombone and they
need
trombone players or whether they're looking for a very diverse group of
people
in terms of ZIP codes or in terms of what your major may be, then if, as
a community, they determine that they are committed to these other
features
and there are students who have those other characteristics, play the
trombone, who are likely, because of past success, show promise of being
a Supreme Court justice or of winning some science finals or science
fellowship, put their names in twice or put their names in three times to
enhance the chances that they will be selected.
<p>
Some students said, `Well, why are we focused--why are we allowing Lowell
High
School to use this test?  What do we know about this test?  Does this test
predict any success or is it just an arbitrary way of screening people?
Maybe
they should not allow anybody to go to Lowell High School for four years
and
instead they should have people come through the school for a year.  If
it's
such a valuable resource, why should they limit it only to those students
who
score well on a particular test?'
<p>
They came up with many, many different solutions.  The point of this
exercise
is not that they came up with the right answer.  The point of this
exercise is
that they came up with a really helpful, creative process.  A group of
very
diverse people with very different, deeply held beliefs were able to work
together and to work through a problem in ways that each of them could
respect
the views and the approaches of people on very different sides of the
podium.
<p>
I gave a similar talk to the United Methodist Church and a middle-aged man
raised his hand after I was finished and he said, `I know exactly what you
are
talking about.  It's what my wife has been telling me for 30 years of
marriage.'  I said, `Well, that's great.  What is it?'  And he said, `My
wife
has been telling me that when we fight, I fight to win and she fights to
resolve.'  And I think if there's anything about this positive vision from
this class, it is fighting--it is disagreeing to resolve, not to win.
<p>
Thank you very much.
