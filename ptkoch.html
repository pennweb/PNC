		The most recent round of the national debate over funding for the National
		Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities
		(NEH) ended one year later, on July 21, 1998. On that day the House of
		Representatives approved $98 million for the NEA for fiscal 1999 and
		rejected the conservative Republican position that tax dollars should not
		be used to support the arts. This is the latest chapter in a concerted
		assault on the arts -- and eventually humanities -- that has been raging
		with
		more or less ferocity since May 1989 when Sen. Jesse Helms, on information
		supplied by the conservative Christian American Family Association,
		condemned Andres Serrano's "Piss Christ" in an NEA-funded exhibition at
		the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, North
		Carolina.
		<p>
			But conservative discomfort with the endowments has existed since
			their founding; it first received national attention during the Reagan
			Administration. The real debate is not about money, or accusations of
			obscenity, or even -- as the National Endowment for the Humanities was
			dragged into the controversy -- over disagreements about how history is
			taught in our nation's schools. There are enduring enmities between those
			who favor a government role in supporting our national cultural life, and
			those, who for a variety of reasons, do not. Those in favor point to the
			record of support by governments in Europe, historical precedent, and the
			need to foster arts and scholarship in locations and disciplines where
			such activities would not be supported by market forces or private
			philanthropy. Opponents often take a libertarian approach, arguing
			against government involvement at all, or as social conservatives they
			oppose support for the arts and humanities on moral grounds as part of a
			broad-based critique of government rooted in religious beliefs that are at
			variance with prevailing public policy and values.

			<p>
				The philosophical differences between the two sides represent
				varying views about human nature and its relation to government.
				Endowments proponents generally hold modern liberal-moderate political
				views: minimal intrusion on the part of the state in private life combined
				with confidence in an activist government to guarantee individual rights
				and broad access to social goods such as economic, educational, and
				cultural opportunity. This view is opposed by many political opponents of
				the endowments, but by far the strongest opposition comes from Christian
				conservatives who advocate elimination of the NEA (and the NEH in the heat
				of the 1995 funding crisis) as part of their broader social agenda. For
				them individual rights and free expression, fundamental values in the
				liberal tradition, are radically at odds with a world view from an older
				ideology that sees human beings as basically flawed, their capacities for
				good nurtured only in the strict observance of Christian dogma. A
				government that fails to enforce these precepts is at odds with their
				deepest beliefs and must be changed. The Reverend Peter J. Gomes
				described the fervency of these political convictions in "The New
				Liberation Theology":
				<p>
					<blockquote>
						Within the Christian Coalition are groups adamantly opposed to abortion,
						homosexual civil rights, and the United Nations. Many are in favor of
						"creation-science" as an alternative to the theory of evolution; seek some
						kind of constitutional amendment that permits prayer in the public
						schools; want government vouchers for private education. Nearly everyone
						in the Christian Coalition agrees that the coarsening of our
						culture -- through pornography, sexual violence, and the demise of the
						traditional nuclear family -- comprises the greatest threat to our
						civilization. Their agenda is clear, and they now have the resources to
						put that agenda before the American people. They are organized,
						ambitious, and filled with a zeal that contrasts sharply with the
						tired-out politics and issues of the major parties. They are at war with
						the powers that be, and with the culture, that have for so long denied
						them and the legitimacy of their aspirations.(2)
						<p>
					</blockquote>


					While members of the Christian Right are certainly the most organized and
					vocal opponents of the endowments, their position also reverberates with
					those -- mostly the politically ambitious -- who attack the "eastern
					Establishment" and "cultural elite" in timeworn but often effective
					arguments that divide Americans along class and sectional lines.
					<p>
						<b>The Terms of the NEA/NEH Debate</b>
						<p>
							The arguments on both sides are, by now, familiar to many Americans. The
							Right, on the attack in the culture war of words, employs powerful
							arguments that are based in emotion and are hard to refute rationally.
							Their campaign is well funded, well organized, and apparently able to
							exert an influence in the press and in Congress disproportionate to their
							number. The two sides of the debate often take the following positions:
							<p>
								<blockquote>

									<i>Opponents:</i> Should the United States, which has no history of royal
									patronage or an established church, be engaged in directly sponsoring arts
									and learning? At risk, opponents of arts funding argue, is the
									independence of expression. Should America have an official art? Should
									it commission scholarship? A body of work that has been approved and
									funded by government agency smacks of communism or fascism.
									<p>
										<i>Proponents:</i> Exactly the opposite is true. The U.S. government,
										like all
										countries, has an interest in fostering the nation's culture. It is in
										the interest of American taxpayers to protect accessibility and freedom of
										expression by supporting culture with their tax dollars. Otherwise the
										arts and learning become the province of the few. The wealthy elite and
										corporations will inevitably silence points of view in opposition to their
										interests if they are paying the bills. Moreover, without government
										support the arts cannot survive in the American free enterprise system
										where media conglomerates aggressively market entertainment as "art" to an
										insatiable popular audience.
										<p>
											<i>Opponents:</i> Elitist! Large cultural institutions, artists, and
											intellectuals -- most of the them located on the East Coast -- have no
											right
											to
											use the tax dollars of working people across the nation to subsidize arts
											and scholarship that benefit only themselves. It is far more democratic
											to let the market decide which art should prosper. Besides, great artists
											will produce their masterpieces in spite of -- perhaps because of --
											poverty.
											Look at Vincent Van Gogh, Mozart. Artists with NEA grants get lazy, too
											comfortable. If big museums and symphonies were producing what people
											really want, they wouldn't need subsidies.
											<p>
												<i>Proponents:</i> For each American taxpayer, the price of two postage
												stamps
												was the value of the federal contribution to the arts in 1994; today it
												is almost half that. The nation's great cultural and educational
												institutions, its artists and scholars, produce cultural "capital" that
												benefits the whole nation through traveling museum exhibitions and
												theater
												and opera productions, scholarship and preservation projects that inform
												the nation through research products that include TV and film
												productions,
												better informed teachers, and scholarly monographs that extend the
												frontiers of knowledge. Should America renounce its world leadership in
												the arts and higher education for the price of two postage stamps per
												taxpayer?
												<p>
													<i>Opponents:</i> Federal support for arts and education is
													unconstitutional.
													It is another misguided product of the 1960s Great Society that we
													can no
													longer afford.
													<p>
														<i>Proponents:</i> The federal government has been in the
														business of
														advancing
														arts and education since the founding of the Library of Congress
														in 1800
														and the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. Since the establishment
														of the
														two national endowments in 1965, America's cultural life and
														educational
														leadership have grown to an unprecedented degree. American arts
														and
														learning are the envy of the world. Without federal dollars and
														the
														imprimatur of a federal grant that attracts private support, the
														arts will
														wither away.
														<p>
															<i>Opponents:</i> Americans will always be world leaders
															with or without
															federal
															subsidy. That "imprimatur" issue is exactly the point. There
															should be
															no "government seal of approval" on any art. And it
															certainly should not
															be on obscene and pornographic art, and as for the Library
															of Congress and
															the Smithsonian -- and the Corporation for Public
															Broadcasting -- they're
															on
															our
															list, too.
															<p>
								</blockquote>

								<b>
									The Dollars Involved
								</b>
								<p>
									It is well known that the actual dollar contribution of the federal
									agencies to the nation's cultural life is minute. The combined 1998
									appropriations for the two national endowments is $.78 per person in the
									United States, while the total government (including state and local)
									spending on culture in this country is $6.25. In other Western countries
									the government share of spending on culture is much higher: $27.40 per
									person in the United Kingdom and $97.70 in Finland, the biggest spender in
									Europe. The combined budgets of the NEA and the NEH will amount to
									approximately 1/100 of 1% of the 1999 federal budget of $1,751 billion.
									In the United States private philanthropy's share is much more important
									than it is in other countries, but it only amounts to another $2.96 per
									person -- bringing our total support for culture to less than $10 per
									person.
									NEA and NEH appropriations since 1966 are shown in Figure 1.(3)

											<b>
												Early Efforts to Establish Cultural Endowments
											</b>
											<p>
												The National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 provided
												for the establishment of a National Council on the Arts and a National
												Council for the Humanities, the two endowments, and ultimately arts and
												humanities councils in every state. The two endowments probably trace
												their roots most directly to the Depression-era WPA programs: the
												Federal
												Art Project, Federal Music Project, Federal Writers Project, and Federal
												Theater Project. Besides providing needed employment for artists, they
												also gave many Americans their first experience with "public art" as
												communities dealt with artists on civic boards determining standards for
												highly visible public commissions in schools, post offices, and city
												halls. Art and artists were no longer the province of the "high" society
												of art museums and symphony orchestras, but rather of society as a
												whole. (4)
												<p>
													During the Depression some legislation was proposed at the federal
													level that would have had the power to institutionalize some of
													these
													activities on a permanent basis. (5) But with the beginning of World
													War
													II,
													the political will to establish a national cultural agency
													disappeared.
													As the economy improved, WPA legislation was phased out and
													conditions
													largely returned to their pre-war stasis: government support for the
													arts -- with the exception of practical necessities such as
													monuments and
													military bands -- was perceived as a frill and outside the
													legitimate
													realm
													of government support. During the war the government sponsored
													propagandistic arts projects to advance the war effort; but with the
													exception of programs sponsored by the Office of Inter-American
													Affairs
													(headed by Nelson Rockefeller), which sponsored tours and cultural
													exchanges with Latin America, whatever modest arts funding existed
													was
													usually buried in the budgets of nonarts programs.
													<p>
														The immediate precursor of the national endowments came as an
														extension of Rockefeller's activities with the OIAA during World
														War II.
														In 1954 Rockefeller, then an undersecretary in Eisenhower's
														Department of
														Health, Education, and Welfare, developed a plan based on the
														Arts Council
														of Great Britain to create a National Council on the Arts. But
														necessary
														legislation failed in Congress. Nancy Hanks, who worked for
														Rockefeller
														at the time and was later to become a popular chair of the NEA,
														described
														the derision with which this proposal was met in Congress where
														the bill
														was referred to as the "President's toe dance bill."
														Nonetheless,
														according to Hanks, this legislation saw life a few years later
														in 1960
														when Rockefeller became governor of New York and it served as
														the model
														for the New York State Council on the Arts. (6)
														<p>
															The 1965 federal legislation was also patterned after the
															1954
															bill (according to Hanks) and it was in that year that
															cultural and
															educational advocacy efforts in a number of areas finally
															coalesced. The
															Rockefeller Panel Report,<i> The Performing Arts: Problems
																and
																Prospects,</i>
															made front page news describing serious funding problems in
															some the
															nation's largest arts organizations. The Elementary and
															Secondary School
															Act, authorizing schools to "develop innovative projects
															which . . .
															utilize the service of arts groups and cultural resources in
															their
															communities" was passed, and a crucial piece of legislation
															was crafted in
															Congress that brought together the parallel but divergent
															efforts of arts
															and humanities advocates.

															<p>
																As had been the case since the 1930s, advocacy for the
																arts and
																humanities -- while never popular among American
																political leaders --
																enjoyed
																the support of a few leaders at the highest levels. The
																Kennedys'
																Camelot, inspired by Jacqueline Kennedy's love for the
																arts, briefly
																placed the arts at the center of the national life, with
																practical policy
																consequences. For example in 1961, Arthur Goldberg,
																secretary of labor
																for the Kennedy Administration, brought the department
																into action as
																arbitrator in the Metropolitan Opera Strike, stating,
																"the nation must
																come to accept the arts as a new community
																responsibility and part of this
																responsibility must fall to the federal government." In
																1963 August
																Hecksher, former director of the Twentieth Century Fund,
																who had been
																appointed two years earlier by President Kennedy as his
																special consultant
																on the arts, issued a special report on the relationship
																between the arts
																and the federal government. This led to the
																establishment within the
																Executive Branch of a special advisor on the arts. In
																1964 President
																Johnson appointed Roger L. Stevens, a theatrical
																producer, to the newly
																permanent post of special assistant to the president on
																the arts. Stevens
																became an active arts advocate with Congress and
																succeeded in getting a
																plank in the Democratic National Committee platform that
																year pledging
																continued support for the arts. (7)
																<p>
																	At the same time humanities advocates organized the
																	first
																	Commission on the Humanities, a "blue-ribbon" panel
																	of scholars convened
																	by the American Council of Learned Societies, the
																	Council of Graduate
																	Schools, and Phi Beta Kappa that was funded by the
																	Rockefeller Foundation.
																	The commission issued a report calling for the
																	establishment of a national
																	agency consistent with President Kennedy's "New
																	Frontier," a national call
																	for excellence in scholarship justified by a belief
																	in the implicit value
																	to the nation of a thriving cultural and
																	intellectual life.
																	<p>
																		As support for cultural funding grew,
																		long-standing political
																		divisions that had stymied previous federal
																		efforts became more public as
																		debate intensified. Arts and humanities
																		advocates were generally liberal
																		Democrats and Republicans, while conservatives
																		of both parties espoused
																		small government and untrammeled free
																		enterprise. Not insignificantly,
																		arts and humanities supporters were also well
																		educated and drawn from
																		urban areas where many leading cultural and
																		educational institutions were
																		and still are concentrated. Their opponents were
																		often from the South or
																		rural areas and frequently anti-intellectual.
																		<p>
																			By 1965, the year of the successful
																			legislation that combined the
																			two separate arts and humanities advocacy
																			efforts into a single National
																			Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act,
																			more than 100 separate bills in
																			favor of cultural funding were introduced in
																			the 89th Congress. The
																			leading sponsor in the House was Frank
																			Thompson of New Jersey joined by
																			John Brademas (Indiana), Sidney Yates
																			(Illinois), John Lindsay (New York),
																			Lloyd Meeds (Washington), and many others.
																			Leading supporters in the
																			Senate included Claiborne Pell (Rhode
																			Island), Hubert Humphrey
																			(Minnesota), Jacob Javits (New York), Claude
																			Pepper (Florida), Joseph
																			Clark (Pennsylvania), and Abraham Ribicoff
																			(Connecticut). It was Pell who
																			spearheaded the combined arts and humanities
																			legislation, joined in the
																			House by Thompson. (8)

																				Opponents in the early 1960s used
																				arguments against the endowments
																				that still ring familiar: "With the
																				nation $290 billion in debt," declared
																				Rep. Howard Gross of Iowa, "an
																				additional $200,000 each year for a
																				council
																				might be better deferred until we have a
																				balanced budget in this country
																				and start retiring the Federal debt."
																				Rep. Howard Smith of Virginia, an
																				outspoken foe and chairman of the
																				powerful House Rules Committee,
																				displayed his animosity for the cultural
																				elite":
																				<p>
																					<blockquote>
																						What are the arts? And here is
																						where I display my ignorance. I

																					</blockquote>

																					<p>
																						In Senate debate over the

																						the supporters' contention that
																						government
																						involvement in arts subsidies
																						was covered under the "general
																						welfare"
																						clause and raised the specter of
																						government control of the arts:
																						"the
																						Federal Government has the power
																						to control that which it
																						subsidizes and
																						experience proves that when the

																								The Reagan Crisis
																								<p></b>
																							The 1966 appropriation to
																							the NEA was nearly $2.9 and
																							$5.9 million went to
																							the NEH. Funding and
																							programming at the
																							endowments grew throughout
																							the
																							1970s, expanding to new
																							audiences and dramatically
																							increasing the arts and
																							humanities presence in local
																							communities and national
																							institutions.
																							<p>
																								To be sure, there were
																								controversies in the
																								1970s since the
																								endowments were always
																								easy targets. One of
																								Sen. William Proxmire's
																								"uncoveted" Golden
																								Fleece awards was given
																								to the NEA in 1977 for a
																								grant
																								it made to an artist who
																								filmed colored crepe
																								paper as she threw it
																								from
																								an airplane. The NEH
																								received its share of
																								Golden Fleeces, too.
																								Joseph
																								McLellan, writing for
																								the<i> Washington
																									Post</i> in the
																								mid-1980s,
																								recalled
																								"sporadic, scattered
																								protests (usually in
																								Congress, sometimes in
																								the
																								press) about budget
																								increases" and noted
																								that when in the first
																								ten years
																								Nancy Hanks increased
																								the NEA budget from $2.5
																								million to almost $75
																								million, George Will
																								called her "the Mayor
																								Daley of the Arts."
																								Proxmire
																								"found the NEA budget as
																								hard to cut as the
																								Pentagon budget. When he
																								attacked the soaring NEA
																								budget, his phone rang
																								off the hook with
																								protests
																								from grant recipients
																								all over Wisconsin."
																								(11)
																								<p>
																									But in late 1980,
																									the criticism
																									suddenly took a more
																									ominous turn

																									reported on the

																									<i>New York

																																the

																																NEA/NEH
																																funding
																																controversy
																																was

																																But

																																the

																																was

													If by 1985 the opponents had not succeeded completely in their
													original budget cutting objectives, they had nonetheless found their
													flash
													point. In September of that year, McLellan wrote that a few weeks
													earlier
													a "trio of Texas congressmen" had spearheaded the effort to withhold
													grants to individual artists whose work was "found offensive to the
													average person." He dismissed the effort as "a bit of noise" that
													was
													"quietly buried by the endowment's congressional friends, who have
													by now
													accumulated a lot of experience in handling such problems." (19) But
													his
													sanguinity was proved wrong. In 1989, when the next furor broke, the
													charge that the NEA funded "offensive" art found a national audience
													as
													social and political conservatives joined forces with those who saw
													political advantage in attacking the "arts elite."
													<p><b>
															The Serrano-Mapplethorpe Controversy
															<p></b>
														<blockquote>

															The storm . . . broke on the Senate floor on May 18, as
															Senator Alfonse
															D'Amato rose to denounce Andres Serrano's photograph <i>Piss
																Christ</i> as
															trash.
															"This so-called piece of art is a deplorable, despicable
															display of
															vulgarity," he said. . . . Not to be outdone, Senator Jesse
															Helms joined
															in the denunciation: "The Senator from New York is
															absolutely correct in
															his indignation and in his description of the blasphemy of
															the so-called
															art work. I do not know Mr. Andres Serrano, and I hope I
															never meet him.
															Because he is not an artist, he is a jerk. . . . Let him be
															a jerk on his
															own time and with his own resources. Do not dishonor our
															Lord." Within
															minutes over 20 senators rushed to join [D'Amato] in sending
															a letter to
															Hugh Southern, acting chair of the NEA, demanding to know
															what steps the
															agency would take to change its grant procedures. "This work
															is shocking,
															abhorrent and completely undeserving of any recognition
															whatsoever" the
															senators wrote. (20)
														</blockquote>
														<p>
															The offending work was a 60-by-40 inch photograph of an
															inexpensive wood
															and plastic crucifix submerged in a transparent container of
															the artist's
															urine. It had been shown, with no public outcry, in a
															three-city exhibit
															organized by the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art
															(SECCA) in
															Winston-Salem, North Carolina. SECCA had received an NEA
															grant, as it had
															for years, for its "Awards in the Visual Arts" series and
															had selected
															Serrano and nine other artists from among five hundred
															applicants for
															inclusion in the exhibition and as the recipients of $15,000
															fellowships.
															But as Carole S. Vance, who summarized the controversy in a
															September 1989
															article for<i> Art in America </i>put it, "How the senators
															came to know
															about
															the regional show was not accidental."
															<p>
																<blockquote>

																	The show had closed by the end of January 1989, yet
																	throughout the spring,
																	the right-wing American Family Association, based in
																	Tupelo, Mississippi,
																	attacked the photo, the exhibition and its sponsors.
																	The association and
																	its executive director, United Methodist minister
																	Rev. Donald Wildmon,
																	were practiced in fomenting public opposition to
																	allegedly "immoral,
																	anti-Christian" images and had led protests against
																	Martin Scorsese's film
																	The Last Temptation of Christ the previous summer.
																	The AFA newsletter,
																	with an estimated circulation [of] 380,000 including
																	178,00 churches,
																	according to association spokesmen, urged concerned
																	citizens to protest
																	the art work and demand that responsible NEA
																	officials be fired. The
																	newsletter provided the relevant names and
																	addresses, and letters poured
																	in to congressmen, senators, and the NEA. (21)
																</blockquote>
																<p>
																	A few weeks later when "Robert Mapplethorpe: The
																	Perfect Moment"
																	was scheduled to open at the Corcoran Gallery of Art
																	in Washington, the
																	furor escalated. The Mapplethorpe show had been
																	organized by the
																	Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) at the
																	University of Pennsylvania.
																	The ICA had received $30,000 from the NEA for the
																	show, which originated
																	in Philadelphia and was scheduled to travel to five
																	other cities.
																	<p>
																		A retrospective of the artist's work over a
																		twenty-year period
																		(Mapplethorpe had died of AIDS in March 1989),
																		the exhibit included more
																		than 150 photos: formal portraits, flowers,
																		children, and sexually
																		explicit gay and sadomasochistic erotic poses.
																		It was presented in
																		Philadelphia from December 1988 through January
																		1989, where it was well
																		received, and then moved on to the Museum of
																		Contemporary Art in Chicago,
																		where its run was uneventful. But according to
																		Vance, what happened next
																		was entirely a different story.
																		<p>
																			<blockquote>

																				. . . But by June 8, Representative Dick
																				Armey (R-Tex.) sent [NEA acting
																				chair] Southern a letter signed by over
																				100 congressmen denouncing grants
																				for Mapplethorpe as well as Serrano, and
																				threatening to seek cuts in the
																				agency's $170 million budget. . . .
																				Armey wanted the NEA to end its
																				sponsorship of "morally reprehensible
																				trash," and he wanted new grant
																				guidelines that would "clearly pay
																				respect to public standards of taste
																				and decency." Armey claimed he could
																				"blow their budgets out of the
																				water" by circulating the Mapplethorpe
																				catalogue to fellow legislators
																				prior to the House vote on the NEA
																				appropriation. Before long about 50
																				senators and 150 representatives had
																				contacted the NEA about its funding.
																				(22)
																			</blockquote>

																			<p>
																				Amid cries of censorship from the arts
																				community and liberals, the
																				Corcoran canceled the show rather than
																				run it in Washington during budget
																				negotiations. Outraged, a local
																				alternative arts group, the Washington
																				Project for the Arts, ran the show
																				instead. With the exhibit later
																				scheduled to travel to Cincinnati's
																				Contemporary Arts Center, trustees
																				there voted to uphold their contract
																				with the ICA and hosted the show
																				accompanied by warnings and other
																				safeguards against children viewing the
																				explicitly sexual material. Nonetheless,
																				the museum's director, Dennis
																				Barrie, was arrested on charges of
																				violating community standards of
																				decency. The arrest was a result of
																				pressure exerted on Cincinnati law
																				enforcement officials by a local
																				religious alliance, Citizens for
																				Community Values, which included among
																				its program objectives a
																				determination to fight pornography
																				through the criminal justice system.
																				After a trial that shook the museum
																				community to its core, Barrie was
																				acquitted by a jury of four men and four
																				women in October 1990. (23)
																				<p>

																					The turmoil affected the budget
																					debates in both houses. Angry
																					members of Congress vowed to gut the
																					NEA budget, though they were stopped
																					by more moderate amendments that
																					signaled congressional disapproval
																					of the
																					controversial grants by deducting
																					the total cost ($45,000) of the
																					Serrano
																					and Mapplethorpe grants from the
																					1990 appropriation. In late July
																					Jesse
																					Helms's bill to prevent the NEA from
																					sponsoring "obscene or indecent" art
																					passed a Senate voice vote but died
																					in the House of Representatives.
																					Congress authorized a $2 million
																					increase in the NEA budget but
																					withheld
																					$45,000 -- the amount spent on the
																					Serrano and Mapplethorpe exhibits.
																					In
																					September a Congressional committee
																					added an antiobscenity clause to NEA
																					appropriations that would ban
																					federal funds for art that "may be
																					considered obscene, including but
																					not limited to, depictions of
																					sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the
																					sexual exploitation of children, or
																					individuals engaged in sex acts and
																					which, when taken as a whole, do not
																					have serious literary, artistic,
																					political or scientific value." (24)

																						While it had no immediate impact
																						on funding for the arts, the
																						controversy secured the
																						conservatives' first concession
																						to their agenda
																						and inaugurated a new wariness
																						on the part of the arts
																						community. As
																						described by Judith Tannenbaum,
																						who was then acting director of
																						the ICA:
																						<p>
																							<blockquote>

																								The bill that was
																								finally passed by both
																								the House and the Senate
																								in
																								October 1989 represented
																								a compromise from the
																								original Helms amendment
																								and the harsh punitive
																								measures earlier
																								proposed for both ICA
																								and SECCA.
																								That legislation,
																								enacted to appropriate
																								funds for both the NEA
																								and the
																								[NEH] in 1990, however,
																								did include a clause
																								requiring that Congress
																								be
																								notified of any grants
																								recommended for funding
																								to ICA or SECCA. No one
																								could have predicted
																								just six months before
																								that we would now be
																								grateful
																								for what amounted to
																								being placed on
																								probation, and that,
																								similarly, the
																								arts community would
																								accept an obscenity
																								clause of any kind. Yet
																								these
																								compromises represented
																								a victory of sorts,
																								given the more extreme
																								Senate
																								bill that might have
																								been adopted. (25)
																							</blockquote>

																							<p>
																								In the spring of 1990
																								the National Council on
																								the Arts voted to
																								reject two grants to the
																								ICA that had been
																								recommended for funding
																								by peer
																								review. It was felt that
																								funding the exhibits,
																								although their content
																								was
																								entirely uncontroversial
																								in nature, might be
																								perceived "as an act of
																								defiance towards
																								Congress." (26) That
																								decision was overturned
																								the
																								following
																								August, but the council
																								refused to reconsider
																								grants that had been
																								rejected on similar
																								grounds to performance
																								artists Karen Finley,
																								Holly
																								Hughes, John Fleck, and
																								Tim Miller. It was their
																								case that eventually
																								made its way to the
																								Supreme Court, which
																								upheld the "obscenity
																								clause" as
																								constitutional in June
																								1998. (27)

																										"contract"
																										produced by

																										1995,
																										<i>Contract with

																										"profamily"

																											The

																											was

																											press

																											in the

																											attended by

																											Prepared by

																											from RNC for

																											Association,
																											the
																											Christian

																												Contract</i>
																											urged
																											"privatization
																											of the
																											National
																											Endowment
																											for the Arts
																											(NEA)
																											because we
																											do not view
																											such funding
																											as a proper
																											role for the
																											United

																											But the

																											quickly
																											moved to
																											justify its
																											position in
																											terms of the
																											NEA's
																											support for
																											"public
																											funding for
																											obscene art"
																											growing out
																											of the
																											Mapplethorpe-Serrano

																											"Over the

																											"politicization."
																											The

																											<p>
																												In the

																												<i>Contract,</i>
																												elimination
																												was
																												addressed
																												more

																												a
																												budgetary
																												--

																												of the

																												carried
																												the

																												with the

																												tradition
																												of local

																												of

																												(32)
																												At this

												The calls for elimination of the endowments were incessant and
												they had their intended impact in Congress. The three-year
												reauthorization that both endowments received in 1990 expired and in
												1993
												and 1994, in a climate still heated by Mapplethorpe-Serrano, neither the
												White House nor leaders in Congress had pushed for reauthorization.
												Continued funding was appropriated on a temporary year-to-year basis,
												thereby avoiding the all-out confrontation of reauthorization hearings.
												To the endowments' opponents in the new Congress, this was unacceptable.
												One of the first pledges made in January as the 104th Congress
												reorganized
												was "no appropriations without authorization." And in March, when $5
												million appropriated to each agency by the previous Congress was
												rescinded, arts and humanities advocates felt the first blow to their
												budgets. But like the strange sense of relief experienced by arts people
												five years earlier, when the final 1990 appropriation legislation
												carried
												a compromise version of the original punitive Helms amendment on
												obscenity, the $5 million rescission seemed more a relief than an
												assault.
												Or, as it was put in a retrospective memo sent to humanities councils:
												"By
												March, a lot had happened. We avoided a serious rescission, and the
												councils were fortunate to take no cut at all. Did we dodge <u>a</u>
												bullet, or
												<u>the</u> bullet?" (36) Like the arts advocates who had faced years of
												vocal
												attack that threatened their core purposes, now the humanities
												constituency was grateful for small abuses.
												<p>
													And so amid the press clamor in the winter and spring of 1995,
													reauthorization hearings were held with friends and opponents
													testifying.
													By March advocates were lined up to counter the damaging testimony
													from
													opponents such as Cheney and Bennett who spoke in January. Charlton
													Heston once again testified on behalf of the arts; David McCulloch
													and Ken
													Burns were among those favoring the humanities. By May a House
													committee
													approved the Goodling/Cunningham bill (named for its chief sponsors,
													William F. Goodling of Pennsylvania and Randy Cunningham of
													California)
													calling for a three-year phase out of the NEH, two years for the
													NEA, with
													significant cuts every year leading to "zero" funding.
													<p>
														Chilling as these provisions were to the arts and humanities
														communities, they at least paved the way for appropriations
														discussions,
														which took a tortuous route in the House throughout the summer
														of 1995.
														In the Senate the authorization committee headed by Sens. James
														M.
														Jeffords (Vermont) and Nancy Kassebaum (Kansas) approved a
														reauthorization
														bill proposing a gradual series of cutbacks totaling 20 percent
														over five
														years. Varying appropriations proposals in both houses called
														for
														everything from "zero" funding to cuts of 20, 40, and 50
														percent. The
														most effective friends of the endowments were moderate
														Republicans like
														Jeffords, Kassebaum, and Alan Simpson (Wyoming) in the Senate
														and Reps.
														Steve Gunderson (Alaska), Peter J. Torkildsen (Massachusetts),
														Nancy
														Johnson (Connecticut), and Marge Roukema (New Jersey), who
														worked
														strategically within their own party. In the House Democrats
														Sidney Yates
														and Pat Williams (Montana) continued their strong support, as
														did the ever
														loyal Claiborne Pell. "Dear Colleague" letters were circulated
														and
														trade-offs negotiated, which at times involved funding for the
														National
														Biological Survey and the Naval Petroleum Reserve and even the
														Federal
														Emergency Relief Agency. In the House the appropriations battle
														came down
														to a single up or down vote on what came to be known as the
														Chabot
														Amendment (after Steve Chabot from Ohio), which would have
														eliminated the
														NEH; the amendment was defeated by a wide majority. According to
														Jamil
														Zainaldin, president of the Federation of State Humanities
														Councils, this
														was the crucial moment for the NEH. It clearly demonstrated that
														the
														House leadership was not willing to "fall on its sword" over the
														NEA and
														NEH, nor possibly were a majority of Republicans. (37)
														<p>
															The result in the House was a bill that called for the NEH
															to receive
															$99.9 million in 1996 to be phased out in three years. The
															NEA was to
															receive a similar amount, but was subject to a two-year
															phase out and
															formal reauthorization before it would receive its 1996
															funding. The
															Senate subsequently approved a budget for the NEH of $115
															million and
															$99.9 for the NEA. Finally, in September a House-Senate
															conference
															committee reached a compromise of $110 million for the NEH
															and $99.5 for
															the NEA.
															<p>
																But this was only the beginning of the end of the story.
																The
																federal fiscal year ended on September 30, but by
																November only three of
																thirteen appropriations bills had passed Congress and
																received
																presidential approval. The Interior appropriations bill,
																which included
																the cultural endowments, was among those in limbo. At
																issue was the
																<i>Contract with America</i> provision to balance the
																budget in seven
																years
																with
																the Congressional Budget Office and the Administration's
																Office of
																Management and Budget offering differing estimates of
																annual targets
																needed to achieve a balanced budget by 2002. As late as
																March 28, 1996,
																six months into the fiscal year, Congress was still
																debating five of the
																spending bills, dealing with nine cabinet agencies and
																the District of
																Columbia. They were eventually melded into a single $160
																billion measure
																covering spending for the last half of the year. (38)
																Only a series of
																thirteen "continuing resolutions" or temporary spending
																agreements between
																the White House and Congress kept the government
																functioning at all
																between October and April, but not without disagreements
																that led to two
																federal government shut-downs. Americans felt these most
																acutely in
																delays in securing passports and visas and in closed
																Social Security and
																Veterans' Affairs offices, but the greatest outrage
																resulted from the
																closing of the National Gallery of Art during the
																international tour of
																the Vermeer exhibition. Bad press also resulted from the
																closure of
																national parks, monuments, and the Smithsonian
																Institution. And in the
																end people blamed Speaker Gingrich and the <i>Contract
																	with America.</i>
																<p>
																	Finally, on April 25 Congress approved funding for
																	the agencies
																	that had received no appropriation and the
																	endowments were funded at the
																	level agreed to in the conference committee the
																	previous September. The
																	president signed the appropriations and national
																	attention turned to the
																	presidential election. Press coverage of the
																	endowments fell below its
																	1989 level (39) and, at least in Washington, the NEA
																	and NEH breathed a
																	sigh
																	of relief. Yet each had been dealt a crippling blow:
																	the cut to the NEA
																	budget was 39 percent and to the NEH 36 percent.

																		Fifteen months later, in July 1997, the crisis
																		began its final
																		phase. On July 10, in a 217-216 vote, the House

																		A
																		day later conservatives voted to strip the

																		shut-down costs and rejected the provision for
																		distributing the balance to
																		the states; they voted instead for elimination.

																			President Clinton threatened to veto the
																			entire $13 billion Interior
																			Department appropriations bill if funding
																			were not restored to the NEA.
																			The vote to totally eliminate the NEA also
																			faced strong opposition from
																			moderate Republican Sens. Slade Gorton
																			(Washington), Jeffords, and John
																			Warner (Virginia), who held key positions.
																			In the fall the NEA emerged
																			from a House-Senate conference committee
																			with a $98 million for 1998.
																			<p>
																				At the same time -- July 1997 -- efforts
																				in the House to eliminate
																				the
																				NEH failed by a voice vote. NEH Chairman
																				Hackney had known the crisis was
																				over for the NEH a few months earlier
																				"when the NEH was reported out of
																				[Ohio Rep. Ralph] Regula's
																				[appropriations] subcommittee with $110
																				and the
																				NEA $0, [and] a reporter from the <i>DC
																					Times</i> asked Regula why and he
																				replied, 'Nobody's telling me they're
																				doing terrible things.'" (42)
																				<p>
																					For the NEA it took a year longer.
																					On June 26, 1998 the<i>
																						Chronicle
																						of Higher Education</i>
																					reported, "The NEA found unexpected
																					support
																					Thursday
																					on the House of Representatives
																					Appropriations Committee, which
																					reversed
																					an earlier decision by one of its
																					subcommittees to eliminate financing
																					the
																					agency next year."
																					<p>
																						The cultural endowments are
																						badly hobbled but cautiously
																						optimistic after their struggles
																						against elimination. Their
																						budgets have
																						not recovered their pre-1994
																						level and there is little
																						immediate prospect
																						for such. Both agencies
																						underwent massive layoffs and
																						major program
																						restructuring in the wake of the
																						1995 assault. Their ability to
																						support
																						large national projects,
																						individual artists and scholars,
																						and -- in this
																						year's appropriations language
																						for the NEA -- grants to New
																						York cultural
																						institutions are now curtailed.
																						The Supreme Court has upheld the
																						constitutionality of the NEA's
																						1990 "decency clause." But
																						looking toward
																						the future, both agencies are
																						now headed by respected
																						intellectuals with
																						strong roots in Southern and
																						heartland culture, who are
																						expected to be
																						able to bridge the chasm between
																						the opposing sides in the

																						William J. Ivey, chairman of the

																							<i>The Leadership Issues</i>
																							<p>
																								At the time of their
																								founding the endowments
																								were championed by a
																								powerful
																								group of bipartisan
																								leaders: Presidents
																								Kennedy and Johnson,
																								Nelson
																								Rockefeller, and a group
																								of influential senators
																								and congressmen. Richard
																								Nixon, never a friend of
																								the endowments,
																								nevertheless found
																								political
																								advantage in their
																								support. At the urging
																								of Leonard Garment, his
																								"arts
																								loving saxophone playing
																								legal aide," he oversaw
																								substantial increases in
																								the endowments budgets
																								-- at least until his
																								1972 nomination was
																								secure.
																								(44) Also under Nixon
																								(although credit for
																								them must go to
																								Claiborne
																								Pell) the
																								state humanities
																								councils were organized,
																								expanding public
																								programs in the
																								humanities to local
																								communities through
																								relatively modest grants
																								to the
																								states -- and, not
																								incidentally, building a
																								political base for the
																								humanities
																								in local communities.
																								(45) Budget growth
																								continued during the
																								Carter
																								Administration
																								accompanied by a number
																								of initiatives at both
																								endowments
																								that extended the reach
																								of the arts and
																								humanities to minority
																								communities
																								and other nontraditional
																								audiences.
																								<p>
																									With the election of
																									Ronald Reagan,
																									however, the dynamic
																									shifted.
																									Critics at the time
																									made their arguments
																									on political grounds
																									that opposed
																									the expansion of
																									arts and humanities
																									programs to
																									traditionally
																									Democratic
																									constituencies. The
																									Heritage Foundation
																									report prepared at
																									the time of
																									Reagan's election
																									decried the NEA's
																									Expansion Arts
																									Program (described
																									in
																									the endowment's 1979
																									annual report as "a
																									point of entry for
																									developing
																									groups that are
																									established in and
																									reflect the culture
																									of minority, blue
																									collar, rural and
																									low-income
																									communities") as an
																									example of the
																									dilution
																									of aesthetic
																									standards. The NEH
																									was lambasted for
																									sacrificing
																									"scholarly
																									excellence" in favor
																									of "political"
																									projects that did
																									not properly belong
																									"in the realm of
																									humanities." A 1980
																									grant of $199,953 to
																									a group called
																									the Working Women:
																									National Association
																									of Office Workers,
																									which held
																									classes and film
																									forums on the
																									struggle of office
																									workers for improved
																									conditions, was
																									criticized as an
																									example of the
																									politicization of
																									the
																									humanities with
																									"populist" or
																									"social action"
																									programs considered
																									to have
																									little scholarly
																									merit.
																									<p>
																										Ironically -- in
																										terms of later
																										charges of
																										elitism against
																										the
																										endowments --
																										those involved
																										in crafting the
																										Heritage
																										Foundation
																										critique
																										were proponents
																										of elite
																										culture. Their

																										limiting
																										endowment
																										expenditures in
																										nontraditional
																										areas coincided
																										with Republican
																										political

																										for

																										assisted
																										by

																												Deploring
																												what it
																												calls "a

																												conception
																												of art"
																												and
																												the
																												"trifling
																												sums"
																												now
																												allocated
																												for
																												individual
																												composers,

																												artists,
																												the
																												report
																												goes on
																												to say
																												that
																												"the NEA

																												dollars
																												yearly
																												to fund
																												programs
																												and
																												policies

																												accomplishments;
																												the best

																												culture
																												of the
																												past,
																												and the
																												worst
																												are
																												little
																												more
																												than
																												high-flown
																												welfare

																												It calls
																												for a

																																	Nevertheless
																																	and
																																	at
																																	the
																																	most
																																	important
																																	level
																																	the
																																	political
																																	process
																																	worked.
																																	Despite
																																	the
																																	extreme
																																	rhetoric
																																	and
																																	distortions
																																	that
																																	characterized
																																	much
																																	of
																																	the
																																	press
																																	coverage,
																																	within
																																	Congress
																																	the
																																	endowments
																																	received
																																	their
																																	hearing.
																																	Part
																																	of
																																	it
																																	might
																																	be
																																	attributable
																																	to
																																	a
																																	continuing
																																	culture
																																	of
																																	civility
																																	within
																																	Congress
																																	itself.
																																	For
																																	example,
																																	some
																																	believe
																																	that
																																	this
																																	year's
																																	failure
																																	to
																																	carry
																																	through
																																	on
																																	plans
																																	to
																																	eliminate
																																	the
																																	NEA
																																	was
																																	testimony
																																	to
																																	the
																																	respect
																																	many
																																	members
																																	of
																																	Congress
																																	feel
																																	toward
																																	long-time
																																	arts
																																	advocate
																																	Sidney
																																	Yates,
																																	who
																																	is
																																	retiring
																																	this
																																	term.
																																	(48)
																																	And
																																	Zainaldin
																																	saw
																																	a
																																	sense
																																	of
																																	fair
																																	play
																																	at
																																	work
																																	in
																																	Ralph
																																	Regula's
																																	handling
																																	of
																																	his
																																	appropriations
																																	subcommittee
																																	hearings
																																	in
																																	1995.
																																	"I
																																	think
																																	Regula
																																	had
																																	made
																																	a
																																	decision
																																	that
																																	he
																																	was
																																	not
																																	going
																																	to
																																	let
																																	the
																																	NEA
																																	and
																																	NEH
																																	go
																																	down
																																	without
																																	a
																																	public
																																	hearing,
																																	which
																																	allowed
																																	for
																																	a
																																	bigger
																																	debate
																																	to
																																	take
																																	place."
																																	Zainaldin
																																	found
																																	that
																																	Regula,
																																	while
																																	maintaining
																																	his
																																	loyalty
																																	to
																																	the
																																	Republican
																																	leadership
																																	and
																																	while
																																	he
																																	had
																																	many
																																	"bones
																																	to
																																	pick"
																																	with
																																	both
																																	endowments,
																																	made
																																	sure

																																	Yates,
																																	who
																																	was
																																	on
																																	the
																																	committee
																																	--
																																	and
																																	through
																																	him
																																	other
																																	supporters
																																	--
																																	were
																																	allowed
																																	to
																																	make
																																	their
																																	case.
																																	In
																																	so
																																	doing
																																	he
																																	let
																																	the
																																	public
																																	debate
																																	move
																																	forward,
																																	allowing
																																	the
																																	political
																																	process
																																	to
																																	work.
																																	Regula,
																																	according
																																	to
																																	Zainaldin,
																																	"played
																																	a
																																	high-minded
																																	role.
																																	He

																																		In

																																		Donald
																																		Wildmon,
																																		Lynne

																																		Cultural

																																		(the

																																		Hackney
																																		for

																																		<p>
																																			Hackney's
																																			approach
																																			was
																																			decidedly

																																			In
																																			countless
																																			speeches
																																			and
																																			meetings
																																			he
																																			articulated
																																			rebuttals
																																			to
																																			the
																																			libertarian
																																			argument
																																			by
																																			describing
																																			important
																																			projects
																																			of
																																			national
																																			scope
																																			that
																																			would
																																			not
																																			have
																																			been
																																			possible
																																			without
																																			the
																																			NEH.
																																			At
																																			the
																																			same
																																			time,
																																			he
																																			stayed
																																			out
																																			of
																																			the
																																			headlines
																																			by
																																			avoiding
																																			a
																																			direct
																																			show-down
																																			with
																																			the
																																			religious
																																			Right:
																																			"the
																																			more
																																			of
																																			that
																																			[high-profile
																																			confrontation]
																																			I
																																			was
																																			seen
																																			doing,
																																			the
																																			less
																																			chance
																																			the
																																			NEH
																																			had
																																			of
																																			surviving,"
																																			he
																																			stated
																																			in
																																			an
																																			interview.
																																			Distinguished
																																			and
																																			respected,
																																			he
																																			was
																																			effective
																																			in
																																			forging
																																			important
																																			ties
																																			with
																																			Republican
																																			Senators
																																			Mark
																																			Hatfield
																																			(Oregon),
																																			Slade
																																			Gorton,
																																			James
																																			Jeffords,
																																			Robert

																																			and

																																			(50)
																																			His
																																			was
																																			a
																																			leadership
																																			that
																																			sought
																																			consensus
																																			rather
																																			than
																																			polarization.
																																			Through
																																			his
																																			efforts
																																			the
																																			often
																																			antagonistic
																																			entities
																																			within
																																			the
																																			humanities
																																			community
																																			learned
																																			to
																																			be
																																			mutually
																																			supportive.
																																			Characteristically,
																																			he
																																			believes
																																			that
																																			in
																																			the
																																			end
																																			the
																																			"real
																																			thing
																																			that
																																			worked"
																																			was
																																			the
																																			outpouring
																																			of
																																			citizen
																																			support
																																			for
																																			the
																																			endowments
																																			through
																																			letters,
																																			telephone
																																			calls,
																																			faxes,
																																			and
																																			telegrams
																																			to
																																			members
																																			of
																																			Congress
																																			throughout
																																			the
																																			country,
																																			demonstrating
																																			that
																																			the
																																			endowments
																																			were
																																			providing
																																			solid
																																			programs
																																			that
																																			were
																																			valued

																																				He

																																				of

																																				leadership:
																																				effective
																																				lobbying
																																				by

																																				of
																																				the

																																				has
																																				a
																																				constituency
																																				that
																																				includes
																																				prominent
																																				board
																																				members
																																				of
																																				major
																																				cultural
																																				organizations.
																																				He
																																				credits

																																				visits
																																				to
																																				every
																																				state
																																				and
																																				more
																																				than
																																				two
																																				hundred
																																				local

																																				and
																																				from
																																				the
																																				"soul,"
																																				with
																																				mobilizing

																																				Grass

																																				and

																																					Grass

																																							The
																																							years
																																							between
																																							the
																																							founding
																																							of
																																							the
																																							endowments
																																							and
																																							the
																																							conservative
																																							assault
																																							saw
																																							dramatic
																																							shifts
																																							in
																																							the
																																							position
																																							of
																																							the
																																							arts
																																							and
																																							humanities
																																							in
																																							America.
																																							Born
																																							out
																																							of
																																							a
																																							Cold
																																							War
																																							and
																																							Great
																																							Society
																																							ethos
																																							that
																																							trumpeted
																																							American
																																							achievement
																																							in
																																							the
																																							arts
																																							and
																																							scholarship
																																							as
																																							a
																																							point
																																							of
																																							national
																																							pride,
																																							by
																																							the
																																							1990s
																																							critics
																																							charged
																																							artists
																																							and
																																							scholars
																																							with
																																							being
																																							destructive
																																							of
																																							the
																																							American
																																							family
																																							and
																																							un-American;
																																							the
																																							endowments,
																																							as
																																							their
																																							federally
																																							funded
																																							standard
																																							bearers,
																																							had
																																							to
																																							be
																																							abolished
																																							for
																																							the
																																							good
																																							of
																																							the
																																							country.
																																							Cultural
																																							advocates,
																																							forced
																																							to
																																							defend
																																							themselves,
																																							truly
																																							became
																																							politicized;
																																							they
																																							turned
																																							to
																																							their
																																							allies
																																							in
																																							communities
																																							and
																																							institutions
																																							and
																																							marshaled
																																							public
																																							and
																																							Congressional
																																							support
																																							for
																																							their
																																							survival.
																																							Deeply
																																							affected
																																							by
																																							the
																																							debate,
																																							cultural
																																							advocates
																																							are
																																							wary
																																							now.
																																							They
																																							have
																																							learned
																																							to
																																							live
																																							with
																																							lower
																																							budgets
																																							and
																																							in
																																							the
																																							public
																																							eye,
																																							self-censoring
																																							and
																																							careful
																																							to
																																							avoid
																																							public
																																							controversy.
																																							(54)
																																							But
																																							many
																																							also
																																							learned
																																							the
																																							importance
																																							of
																																							funding
																																							and
																																							delivering
																																							programs
																																							that
																																							have
																																							meaning
																																							and
																																							value
																																							for
																																							Americans
																																							in
																																							all
																																							their
																																							geographic
																																							and
																																							demographic
																																							diversity.
																																							<p>
																																								Is
																																								the
																																								conflict
																																								over?
																																								Probably
																																								not.
																																								Doctrinaire
																																								conservative
																																								opinion

																																								continue
																																								to
																																								oppose
																																								the

																																								as
																																								evidenced
																																								on
																																								the
																																								websites
																																								of
																																								the
																																								Cato
																																								Institute,
																																								Heritage

																																								in

																																								And
																																								in

																																								of

																																								(55)
																																								For

																																								seems
																																								to

																																								--

																																								<p>
																																									But
																																									there
																																									are
																																									encouraging
																																									signs
																																									in
																																									the
																																									middle,
																																									which
																																									may
																																									well
																																									represent
																																									the
																																									enduring
																																									victory
																																									of
																																									the
																																									culture
																																									wars.
																																									A
																																									rancorous
																																									and
																																									emotional
																																									public
																																									debate
																																									that

																																									started
																																									by
																																									radical

																																									with

																																									of
																																									damaging
																																									the
																																									cultural
																																									endowments
																																									may
																																									ultimately
																																									prove
																																									to
																																									have
																																									strengthened
																																									them.
																																									Because,
																																									in
																																									the
																																									contest
																																									for
																																									the
																																									endowments'
																																									survival,
																																									members
																																									of
																																									Congress
																																									heard
																																									from

																																									and

																																									is
																																									no

																																									the
																																									province
																																									of

																																									The

																																									appointed
																																									endowments

																																									<p>
																																										No
																																										longer
																																										championed
																																										unquestioningly
																																										by
																																										presidents
																																										and
																																										powerful
																																										friends
																																										in
																																										Congress,
																																										the
																																										endowments
																																										in

																																										have
																																										been
																																										the
																																										subject
																																										of
																																										a
																																										national
																																										debate
																																										centered
																																										around
																																										their
																																										value
																																										in
																																										American
																																										society.
																																										The
																																										debate
																																										has
																																										been
																																										messy,
																																										as
																																										politics
																																										always
																																										are,
																																										but
																																										the
																																										result
																																										has
																																										been
																																										a
																																										demonstration
																																										that
																																										culture
																																										in
																																										America
																																										has
																																										many
																																										faces.
																																										It
																																										has
																																										strong
																																										roots
																																										in
																																										local
																																										communities
																																										and
																																										in
																																										a
																																										variety
																																										of
																																										artistic
																																										and
																																										intellectual
																																										traditions.
																																										The

																																										never

																																										satisfied;
																																										but
																																										in
																																										the
																																										contest
																																										for
																																										control
																																										of
																																										American
																																										culture,
																																										the
																																										endowments,
																																										albeit
																																										battle
																																										scarred
																																										and
																																										perhaps

																																										can
																																										take
																																										heart
																																										in
																																										the
																																										knowledge

																																										<p>
																																											What
																																											that
																																											signifies
																																											is
																																											enormous.
																																											It
																																											means
																																											that
																																											the
																																											most
																																											extreme
																																											charges
																																											have
																																											been
																																											put
																																											aside
																																											and
																																											that
																																											there
																																											is
																																											a
																																											bi-partisan
																																											consensus
																																											--
																																											very
																																											likely
																																											for
																																											the
																																											first
																																											time
																																											since
																																											the
																																											endowments'
																																											founding
																																											--
																																											for
																																											a
																																											legitimate
																																											role
																																											for
																																											the
																																											federal
																																											government
																																											in
																																											the
																																											support
																																											of
																																											American
																																											culture.
																																											Charges
																																											of
																																											elitism
																																											and
																																											domination
																																											by
																																											East
																																											Coast
																																											intellectuals
																																											and
																																											moneyed
																																											interests
																																											simply
																																											did
																																											not
																																											hold
																																											up
																																											under
																																											public
																																											scrutiny
																																											when
																																											arts
																																											and
																																											humanities
																																											organizations
																																											from
																																											across
																																											the
																																											country
																																											demonstrated
																																											that
																																											local
																																											communities
																																											in
																																											Kansas
																																											and
																																											Utah,
																																											Washington,
																																											and
																																											Mississippi
																																											value
																																											the
																																											federal
																																											agencies.
																																											<p>
																																												It
																																												also
																																												means
																																												that
																																												the
																																												new
																																												leadership
																																												of
																																												the
																																												endowments
																																												have
																																												an
																																												unparalleled
																																												opportunity.
																																												For
																																												the
																																												past
																																												decade
																																												millions
																																												of
																																												Americans
																																												have
																																												engaged
																																												in
																																												a
																																												national
																																												conversation
																																												in
																																												defense
																																												of
																																												the
																																												arts
																																												and
																																												humanities.
																																												Now
																																												is
																																												the
																																												time
																																												to
																																												keep
																																												that
																																												conversation
																																												going
																																												by
																																												involving
																																												an
																																												even
																																												greater
																																												number
																																												of
																																												Americans
																																												from
																																												all
																																												walks
																																												of
																																												life
																																												in
																																												exploring
																																												the
																																												world
																																												of
																																												ideas.
																																												If
																																												this
																																												is
																																												accomplished
																																												the
																																												NEA
																																												and
																																												the
																																												NEH
																																												can
																																												look
																																												forward
																																												to
																																												playing
																																												an
																																												even
																																												more
																																												important
																																												role
																																												in
