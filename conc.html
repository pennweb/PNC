JUDITH RODIN:  We're going to set up the overhead projector, and I'm going
to take
a crack at summarizing--just a minute ...(unintelligible)
From my own perspective, as somebody who has studied group process and
was trained as a social psychologist, I think this was a very good and
interesting group process.  This is an extremely multidisciplinary group
and a group that really has a very diverse range of experiences, both
professional and, I think, personal, and it was very important to get a
variety of ideas out on the table to as a way of getting to know one
another.
<p>
I gave up the traditional new meeting model of having us each go around
the
room and say a little bit about ourselves, who we were and why we were
here
because I really hoped--and I think the result proves this--that each of
us
would clearly demonstrate who we were and why we were here by our
conversation
and our comments through the day and a half.  The effort to
have some level of integration, I think, will be achieved
in a couple of different ways.  We will actually transcribe the comments
as
well as the proceedings, and we will work over the next few weeks to try
to
synthesize the actual comments and to bring together some of the common
points and common themes.  So I am not going to make an effort at that
synthesis today, but rather to try to point us--and I'll use overheads
that we
created at lunchtime--to point us to questions for our agenda, and then we
can
use the flip chart as you add to these.
<p>
What I'd like to do is go through them all and then come back.  We are
clearly not going to have time to discuss all of them in detail, and
we'll continue our discussion of them over the next weeks and months, but
to
lay out four or five fairly differentiated set groups of questions that we
think collectively represent much of what we've talked about in the last
day
and a half.  Thank you.

<p>

      <img src=images/ques1.gif alt="Questions for our agenda"> 
    </center><br>

The first group of questions really relates to the notion of discourse,
and
we've discussed that quite a bit, what is reasonable discourse and what
is reasoned discourse.  And much of our discussion, I think, would begin
to
answer that question.  And we can, as I said, summarize that discussion.
<p>
We talked a bit about how context frames the perception of discourse.
What is
appropriate in one context may be inappropriate in another, so there's not
an
absolute with regard to the answer to the first question, what is
reasonable
and what is reasoned?  And I think context will be important particularly
as
we talk about culture and community, which are contextual variables, in
addition to being other kinds of variables, that the role of context as
a framing principle is really quite important.  We will need to answer, in
a variety of ways--and again, we've begun that--what stands in the way of
reasonable and reasoned discourse.  We had a variety of candidates and, I
think, some very serious discussion about that.  But I think we will need
to
come to terms with that.  And then we should answer the question what
would
we, as a commission, like to do about that?  What could we do?  And I
think
there are a variety of things that we might do.  What would we like to do
as
we define our agenda going forward?
<p>

The second domain relates to these issues.  Once we've defined reasonable
and
reasoned discourse, in what ways do people--and here, we mean individuals
and people as a collectivity--in what ways do people assert their right to
a
voice?  Here we talked about does everyone have the right to a voice?
Has recent political movements really suggested that everyone does?  And
what we're grappling with as a diverse society is how those various voices
get
expressed in a way that makes them heard.  How do we facilitate the
inclusion
of all of the legitimate voices?
<p>
How do we arrest the decline of civic life?  We focused a great deal on
journalists, but there are varieties of other opinion-shapers, the TV
media,
political leaders, academics.  How do the opinion-leaders and -shapers
stop this delegitimization process that I think we have appropriately
identified, and perform, if possible, a more constructive civic function?
And
then how do we re-establish, if we think that's appropriate, a clearer
boundary between public and private if that represents a problem for our
society and for our societies around the world?

<p>

      <img src=images/ques3.gif alt="Questions">

<p>
A different question that we discussed is the question of how
leadership can be re-established in all aspects of society, in all aspects
of
the community.  We talked a lot about what the balance should be
between the role of experts, the role of the authority and the role of the
constituencies as we tried to restore some level of community and some
level
of civil discourse.  How can leaders lead?  Kathleen
emphasized the positive pressures of the marketplace, but there are so
many
negative pressures of the marketplace.  And the question is how does one
assert a leadership role in this very market-driven moment in our society?
Who are the real and perceived leaders and experts?  We flirted with that
issue a little bit.  I don't think we really came to a full discussion of
it.
It leads to the question of what is the role of expertise in a democratic
society and how do we grapple with that?
<p>

<p>


Finally--and this is just on a quick overhead because it summarizes the
last
session--we talked about community, the creative subversion of boundary,
if
you will.  The 'it' is the community, the subcommunities that make it up.
There really are divisions within our society that make a sense of
community
difficult.  And we're asking the question what kind of dialogue goes on
that
permits communities to reassert themselves, that permits an elaboration of
community as a principle and as a process, and what kinds of institutions
would make our community structures stronger and more readily reinforced?

<p>

<p>
And then finally [I] think we discussed not directly, but implicitly, this
question, and that is if we address our work as a commission, should it be
addressed to the gatekeepers of opinion--the leaders, the media, the
politicians--or should it be addressed to the general public, in terms of
our
efforts--community building, bringing ordinary people together?  And I
think
we need to grapple with which, or both, of those kinds of approaches--and
maybe others as well--should we take. <p>

And I think part of the answer to that depends on your view of where the
current problems are the greatest and/or where the current solutions are
more
potentially to be had.  But I think we do need to think about that as a
commission.  
<p>

<p>
I think that there are a variety of courses of action, and
here I
talk about process, rather than the substance.  We could divide into
task groups and take on others with us; we could commission research or
papers; we clearly are going to have online dialogue using our Web site.
Certainly, we could, at the very most limited, merely increase our efforts
by
taking the problems that we've discussed back to our classrooms, our
colleagues, our fields, in a variety of ways.
<p>
So we could have papers; we could do research; we could bring groups
together; we could have various kinds of initiatives with various kinds of
groups.  The monetary resources are not, at least for the moment, the
inhibitor.  It's really thinking about the structure and how we relate to
some
of these other very interesting initiatives.  We need to
relate to the civic journalism project, to Jim's project, to other
initiatives that are grappling with certain aspects of this same issue in
a way that's constructive and creative, I think, rather than redundant.
<p>




So that's my mini-review.  It clearly can't capture
all of the domains in which we might work, but I've tried to capture at
least
some of the more salient ones as I saw them.  I'm happy to put any of
these
back on or to take other candidates.  I'll certainly circulate this, and
we'll
take minutes here and circulate that as well and continue from that frame.
But, Michael, if you'll help me, why don't we see if there are other
candidates or what your reactions are to what I've proposed?
