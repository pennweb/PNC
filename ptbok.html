<br>
As the 20th century neared its end, the United States enjoyed the dubious
distinction of having the highest health care costs in the world while
being the only major democracy with a substantial fraction of the
population still lacking basic medical insurance.  On several occasions in
this century, Congress seriously considered plans to provide universal
health coverage.  In each case, determined opposition led by physicians,
big business, and Republican lawmakers blocked the proposals.  With the
election of President William Clinton, however, all of the auguries seemed
to favor major reform.  Rising health costs threatened to put American
business at a disadvantage in world markets and thus made corporate
executives receptive to a plan that might shift health costs to the
government.  Growing segments of the medical community expressed a desire
to consider reforms; even hospitals seemed interested in some scheme that
would spare them the heavy burden of giving free medical care to the
uninsured.  Most important of all, large majorities of the public rated
health care reform among the most urgent problems facing the nation and
voiced support for a plan that would provide medical insurance for all
Americans.  Buoyed by this widespread concern, Harris Wofford rode the
health care issue to a surprise victory over Richard Thornburgh in an
interim race for Senate in Pennsylvania during 1991.


<p>Moved by these favorable signs, candidate Clinton made health care
reform a centerpiece of his campaign platform.  His election seemed to
present him with an excellent chance to translate his promises into law.
True to his word, he moved quickly to address the issue by announcing
early in 1993 that he would assemble a task force of experts to review the
subject and construct a plan that he could propose to Congress.  To
underscore his commitment to the effort, the President took the
unprecedented step of naming his wife Hillary to head the task force.

<p>Months later, after deliberating under a cloud of secrecy, the task
force produced its report.  Numbering more than 1000 pages, the final
document detailed a complex plan that would guarantee basic health care
for all Americans.  For most people, coverage would come from employers,
financed by payroll taxes and delivered through carefully regulated
competition among large non-profit health maintenance organizations, such
as the Kaiser Plan and Blue Cross, or for-profit prepaid plans of the kind
that were springing up across the country.  For those who were not
employed, the government would pay the cost of membership in a health
maintenance organization.  To negotiate with the health care providers on
behalf of consumers, monitor their performance, and ensure their
suitability, the Clinton Plan proposed the creation of new public
organizations called health care alliances.


<p>President Clinton announced the plan to the Congress in a widely
acclaimed speech on September 22, 1993.  In forceful tones, he urged the
lawmakers &quot;to fix a health care system that is badly broken...giving
every American health security--health care that is always there, health
care that can never be taken away. &quot;  During the days that followed,
Mrs. Clinton appeared before Congress to respond to detailed inquiries
from one committee after another.  Pictures of the First Lady sitting
alone before a battery of lawmakers coolly answering questions on a
subject of extraordinary complexity won her widespread applause.  Moved by
all the favorable publicity and anxious for reform, large majorities of
the public expressed support for the President's plan.  In the words of TV
analyst William Schneider: &quot;The reviews are in and the box office is
terrific. &quot;

<p>At that moment, the chances for sweeping reform seemed greater than
they had ever been over the long, trying history of health care
legislation.  But appearances proved to be deceiving.  After a year of
innumerable committee hearings, reports, negotiations, trial balloons, and
arguments from every quarter, Senate Leader George Mitchell announced on
September 26, 1994 that health care legislation was dead, at least for
that session of Congress.  After all the  publicity and all the talk, the
failure to produce even limited reform seemed to epitomize the breakdown
in government that many Americans feared.

<p>The health care debate is in many ways an illustration of a process
that is increasingly evident, albeit in less spectacular form, whenever
legislation is proposed affecting large numbers of people.  On such
occasions, it is now common not merely to debate the issues in Congress
but to engage the people directly in ways that resemble an election
campaign.  Members of Congress, of course, return to their districts as
they have always done to talk with constituents.  But Congressional
leaders, along with the President, speak directly to the people through
televised speeches and appearances on talk shows.  Interest groups also
participate more and more actively by televised ads, electronic messages,
and other forms of modern technology to reach the public and urge them to
communicate with their representatives in Congress.  When one adds in
media reporters, talk show hosts, Op-Ed writers and expert commentary of
various kinds, a major piece of legislation, such as Clinton's health care
plan, can set off a national debate of formidable proportions.

<p>Ideally, such a debate ought to display certain characteristics.  It
should provide opportunities for all points of view to be presented.  No
participant should be too weak to present ideas effectively or so powerful
as to dominate the discussion through superior organization and resources.
In addition, for the marketplace of ideas to operate effectively, issues
and arguments must be joined in some fashion so that misinformation,
faulty reasoning, and false issues can be winnowed out and the controversy
reduced to the essential questions backed by enough reliable information
and arguments for citizens to arrive at reasoned conclusions. 

<p>With these requirements in mind, what can be said about the quality of
deliberation in America?  Surely, there are valid reasons for concern.
Major public issues tend to be more and more complicated and difficult to
understand.  The extraordinary wealth of ideas and opinions so
characteristic of America can add to the confusion.  Some major
participants in the debate--especially powerful interest groups--may have
much more money than other interested parties and thus enjoy a substantial
advantage in carrying out an effective mass campaign of persuasion.  Of
course, the media are there to help the public sort out the problems and
understand the proposals and the relevant arguments, but reporters often
seem more interested in describing the political tactics and conflicts
than in discussing the substance of complex policy issues.  Finally, no
debate can succeed without an attentive, interested public, yet Americans
seem increasingly disinterested in politics and distrustful of what they
hear from politicians and public figures.

<p>Can a useful debate about important policy issues take place under
these conditions?  Can it do much to help clarify options, inform
judgment, and contribute to wise results consistent with the broad desires
of the people?

<p>The health care debate of 1993-94 provides an instructive, albeit a
somewhat extravagant case through which to ponder these questions.  Much
space and time were devoted to the issues by newspapers, TV stations and
radio talk shows.  More than &#036;100 million is said to have been spent
on the legislative campaign by the many interest groups concerned with
health care reform.  Most of this amount was devoted to media efforts to
communicate with the public.  Innumerable fliers, TV spots, newspaper
advertisements, and direct mail appeals were directed to citizens by
interest groups on every side of the question.  If there was ever a
&quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; for public policy, the health care debate
was surely a spectacular example.

<p>Yet in the end, this vast effort at persuasion exhibited all of the
weaknesses already identified and more besides.  The debate was confused
throughout by the large number of participating groups in Congress.
Instead of simplifying the discussion by developing a single Democratic
plan, several committees and even individual Senators and Representatives
took it upon themselves to introduce separate reform plans, creating a
daunting array of options for the public to follow and understand.  By the
end of the Congressional debates, 27 different legislative proposals were
advanced, which in turn were identified in the media by 110 different
names.

<p>Interest groups spent large sums communicating with the public, but
most of these efforts seemed designed less to inform than to arouse latent
fears and anxieties. &quot;This plan forces us to buy our insurance
through those new mandatory government health alliances, &quot; complained
a prototypical wife, Louise, in a celebrated series of TV ads paid for by
the Health Insurance Association of America. &quot;Run by tens of
thousands of new bureaucrats, &quot; added husband Harry. &quot;Having
choices we don't like is no choice at all, &quot; replied Louise.
&quot;They choose, we lose, &quot; both concluded with evident
disapproval.

<p>According to a study by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg
School of Communications, 59 percent of all the television ads were
misleading.  In addition, most of the broadcast health reform ads
concentrated  on attacking a position rather than advocating one.  A high
percentage of the ads &quot;impugn&#091;ed&#093; the good will and
integrity of those on the other side of the issue. &quot;  Again and
again, the same exaggerated themes were repeated.  According to one side,
the Clinton Plan amounted to &quot;involuntary euthanasia&quot; and
deprived families of their choice of  a doctor.  According to the other,
&quot;Unless the Clinton Plan is passed, millions of Americans will have
no access to health care. &quot;

<p>Ultimately, the opponents of the Clinton Plan proved more effective
than the supporters.  Many Americans were highly skeptical of government
intervention and fearful that it would squander large amounts of money.
The suspicion that all government programs are wasteful not only offered
tempting opportunities for opponents to exploit through communications
such as the Harry and Louise ads.  They also caused the President's
advisors to back away from trying to explain important parts of the
Clinton Plan to the public. &quot;Whatever you do, &quot; warned one
internal White House memo, &quot;don't get caught up in the details of the
policy. &quot;  Every effort was made to avoid any suggestion of increased
taxes (other than tobacco taxes) or to intimate that more government
bureaucracy might be required.  As Theda Skocpol has observed,
&quot;Promoters of the Clinton Health Security Plan tried to avoid
discussing the [health] alliances as new sorts of governmental
organizations.  Instead of telling Americans as simply and clearly as
possible why this kind of governmental endeavor would be effective and
desirable, their accommodation to the public's distrust of government was
to pretend that President Clinton was proposing a virtually
government-free national health security plan. &quot;

<p>In the end, the White House strategy did more to increase public
misunderstanding than to promote the President's plan.  Weeks after the
President unveiled his proposal, large majorities of Americans still had
no comprehension of what a health alliance did or why it was needed.  Nor
could they understand how the Clinton Plan could insure millions of
Americans who lacked health care coverage without increasing taxes.  Amid
the suspicion that surrounds all government initiatives today, 80 percent
of the public concluded that health costs would rise more than the
President claimed; 54 percent believed that costs would rise &quot;much
more. &quot;  Similarly, although only 25 percent of Americans claimed to
understand what a health alliance was, 65 percent assumed that the
President's plan would result in more bureaucracy.

<p>The only hope of bringing clarity to the debate lay in the media.  To
their credit, reporters did make a serious effort to inform the discussion
and enlighten the public in the early stages of the campaign.  Major
newspapers devoted lengthy columns, even entire pages to trying to explain
the details of Health Care Alliances, employer mandates, and other
intricacies of the Clinton proposal.  With support from the Johnson
Foundation, NBC aired a long program explaining the issues on prime time.
The <i>New York Times</i> ran a 16-page special supplement on health care
reform.  Other newspapers provided extensive coverage of their own.  After
the President's initial speech to Congress, however, in September of 1993,
media attention increasingly turned from the substance of the rival health
plans under consideration to the conflicts and maneuvering of the
different Congressional factions and interest groups that were struggling
to get the upper hand.  Some reporters even speculated that the health
care debate was simply a smokescreen by the Clintons to divert the
public's attention from the Whitewater saga.

<p>As the number of competing proposals grew, substantive news coverage
declined, and the barrage of interest group claims and counter-claims
became more strident.  Only about one-quarter of the newspaper stories and
less than one-fifth of the television coverage focused on the substantive
issues under consideration.  Reporters tended not to mention the several
areas of agreement between Republicans and Democrats, such as the need for
some kind of insurance pools and for some means of allowing workers to
take their health insurance with them when they changed jobs.  Gradually,
a sense of confusion overcame American voters.  Eventually, a majority
came to feel that Congress should abandon the effort and start again from
the beginning the following year.

<p>The public itself surely bears some responsibility for the quality of
the debate.  If the media came to concentrate more on the political
maneuvers of opposing factions, the tactics of powerful interest groups,
and the clashes within the Democratic party, it is surely because many
readers and viewers found these subjects more interesting than the numbing
details of alternative proposals for reform.  If the plight of the
uninsured was not fully appreciated, part of the explanation must be that
the poor and uninsured rarely bothered to vote, let alone make efforts to
understand what was at stake and communicate their views to Congress.

<p>Whoever is ultimately responsible for the quality of the health care
debate, the end result was depressing.  According to careful surveys, the
public was even more confused about health care by the end of Congress'
deliberations than it was when President Clinton first presented his plan
to Congress in September, 1993.  The public's reaction proved highly
significant.  In a survey of lawmakers taken after the Plan met its end,
three-quarters of the members of Congress polled asserted that public
opinion was a &quot;very important&quot; factor in the outcome of the
deliberations.  The problem, then, was not that Congress was unresponsive
to its constituents.  The difficulty was that the &quot;marketplace of
ideas&quot; had failed to produce a working consensus.  Months of intense
competition to persuade Americans only succeeded in sowing confusion about
the underlying facts and creating uncertainty about the proper solution.

<p>Not everyone will be convinced that the health care debate was
seriously deficient.  Those who opposed the Clinton Plan may believe that,
despite all the confusion and exaggeration, the public came to understand
the problem quite clearly.  Behind the glitter of President Clinton's
brave promises, opponents argue, his plan would have produced more
government regulation, a larger federal bureaucracy, higher health costs,
and little or no improvement in the quality of care.  According to these
critics, members of the public who opposed the plan were correct.

<p>Since the Clinton plan was never tried, no one can be sure what
results, good or bad, might have ensued.  Nevertheless, there are
objective reasons for questioning the quality and effectiveness of the
debate, whatever one thinks of the plan's merits.  Not only did the
average voter become <u>more</u> confused rather than <u>less</u> during
the course of the debate; on key facts, the public continued to be
misinformed.  Americans never understood the government's role in Medicare
and the cost that it entailed--a confusion nicely illustrated by a
constituent's angry letter to Representative Pat Schroeder urging her to
&quot;keep the government's hands off my Medicare. &quot;  Three months
after President Clinton's initial speech, 56 percent of the public was
still confused on the vital point of whether his plan guaranteed that
workers would retain their health care coverage if they changed jobs.
Over 70 percent continued to believe that the government spent less on
health care than on humanitarian foreign aid.  Most people thought that
children had better access to health care than the elderly, despite the
existence of Medicare.  Only 25 percent of Americans said that they knew
what a health alliance was, even though these institutions were a critical
part of Mr. Clinton's proposal.

<p>The public was especially badly informed about possible alternatives to
the Clinton Plan.  In March, 1994, a majority of Americans in one opinion
poll stated that they had not heard of any alternative to the Clinton
Plan.  At the end of June, half of all Americans acknowledged being
unaware that either Republicans or Democrats had advanced any alternative
proposals for health reform.  Sixty percent did not know of Congressman
Cooper's plan or Senator Chafee's plan, and two-thirds were ignorant of
Senator Dole's proposal.

<p>The health care debate also failed to throw light on a critical problem
that affected the attitudes of most Americans toward health care reform.
Large majorities of the public felt that the principal cause of high
medical costs was the existence of waste, fraud and greed within the
health care industry.  Accordingly, they were persuaded that adequate
reforms could be financed by curbing these abuses.  This impression was
not misguided on its face.  Doctors' incomes in the United States are
50-200 percent higher than they are in other advanced democracies.  The
General Accounting Office has estimated that fraud accounts for as much as
10 percent of the total health care bill.  Studies show that American
hospitals are much more heavily staffed than hospitals in other industrial
nations and that the country is oversupplied with expensive medical
technologies.  Further studies estimate that up to 20-25 percent of all
medical procedures in the United States are unnecessary.

<p>
<p>Despite such evidence of waste, no effort was made to tell the public
why it was not possible to pay for extending health care to the uninsured
by curbing unjustified expenditures.  The Clintons even tried to reinforce
popular feelings by accusing insurers and pharmaceuticals of making
excessive profits.  Since no one bothered to explain, it is little wonder
that the public's principal reason for rejecting the Clinton Plan was that
it would cost too much.

<p>A final commentary on the health care debate emerges from a <i>Wall
Street Journal</i> article appearing in 1994 entitled, &quot;Many Don't
Realize It's the Clinton Plan They Like. &quot;  The article reported the
results of a Journal-NBC poll asking respondents their reaction to a
health plan that contained all the features of the Clinton proposal
without revealing that it was the President's plan.  Respondents were also
invited to evaluate the four other plans under consideration in Congress,
again without identifying the sponsor of the plan to the readers.  When
the results were tabulated, 76 percent saw &quot;some&quot; or &quot;a
great deal&quot; of appeal in the Clinton proposal, a much more favorable
response than that given to any of the other plans.  This result occurred
at the very time that other polls were reporting a majority of Americans
opposing the Clinton Plan.

<p>The health care debate, of course, is not representative of all public
discussions of policy questions.  Few legislative issues are as
complicated, and none has ever provoked such massive efforts to influence
the view of American voters.  Still, for issues of broad public concern,
the differences are ones more of degree than of kind.  The principal
features of the struggle over health care--the grass-roots lobbying, the
appeal to emotion, the media's preoccupation with controversy and tactics,
the inattention of the public--are all common to most important
legislative campaigns involving topics of direct interest to ordinary
people.  As a result, the lessons one draws from the history of the
Clinton Plan have implications for the entire democratic process in this
country.

<b>The Role of Leadership</b>
</center>
<p>
<p>Since the focus of our attention is on leadership, it is appropriate to
reexamine the health care debate from the standpoint of the President's
role.  How important was his leadership?  How could he have improved the
debate and helped the public reach a better understanding of the issues?
Is there anything he might have done that would have secured the passage
of major health care reform?

<p>To carry through a legislative campaign of this magnitude, effective
Presidential leadership was clearly essential.  Because the issue touched
every American and involved such vital interests, public opinion was bound
to be important, and the President would have to use his &quot;bully
pulpit&quot; to maximum advantage.  His power to command attention and
attract an attentive audience would clearly be vital to overcoming the
doubts and confusions spread by powerful adversaries.

<p>From this standpoint, the President's performance can be criticized on
several grounds.  First of all, one can argue that he attempted to do too
much, too soon in view of his weak popular mandate (43 percent of the
popular vote in 1992).  Perhaps it would have been better to seek reform
in steps, starting with such popular items as covering children and
providing portability of health care benefits.  In this way, he could have
broken a huge subject down into manageable pieces that could be understood
by the American people in the course of a public debate that might have
taken several years.

<p>Another criticism involves the President's use of a task force, headed
by his wife, that operated in secret.  This process tended to shut out
voices that might have helped create a more viable plan--voices of
knowledgeable persons in the Administration who feared to criticize the
work of the First Lady, voices of critics of a managed competition
approach who were excluded from the Task Force, voices of interest groups
and politicians (who were consulted, but not much) who might have exposed
the political vulnerabilities of the eventual plan.  Secret deliberations
and exclusion of contrary voices are probably not a viable way of crafting
a major reform in an environment in which the President has limited
influence over Congress, powerful opponents, and a public distrustful of
government and its capabilities.

<p>Finally, once the plan was introduced the President did too little to
explain it to the people.  Indeed, at the urging of advisors, the
Administration denied that the plan would cost any more than what could be
raised by &quot;sin&quot; taxes and avoided discussing how such important
items as the proposed health care alliances would actually operate.  In an
atmosphere of crisis or during a time of maximum trust, a leader may
gather support for an important proposal without explaining important
details.  But this was not President Clinton's situation.  By saying so
little about costs or the alliances, he allowed his adversaries an open
field to convince an already skeptical public that his plan would cost the
taxpayers money and create another large, unwieldy federal bureaucracy.

<p>Despite these shortcomings, it is one thing to criticize the President
and quite another to maintain that skillful leadership would have secured
the passage of major health care reform.  There is always a temptation in
America to believe that strong leaders can solve anything.  In 1979, when
unemployment and inflation were rising to post-War highs, oil prices were
rising by virtue of OPEC policies, and the Russians were invading
Afghanistan, 78 percent of Americans declared that &quot;there are no
problems in the country that strong leadership cannot solve. &quot;  While
faith of this kind is appealing, however, a hard look at the evidence
suggests that passing major health care reforms in 1993-94 represented a
gargantuan task that would have stymied any President.

<p>To begin with, there were huge deficits in the budget and tremendous
opposition to any tax increases (other than sin taxes).  As a result,
Clinton was forced to devise a plan that could not buy off opposition by
increasing benefits.  In addition, he faced a public with little or no
confidence in government's capacity to function effectively.  Hence, he
had to try to reform the health care system without seeming to add to
bureaucracy.  Furthermore, he had to operate within a climate of acute
distrust toward politicians.  Thus, he had to propose a vast reform in a
highly complicated and sensitive field of activity without being able to
ask the people to take anything on faith.  Finally, he had to contend with
interest groups which would spend over $#036;100 million trying to
convince the public that his ideas were dangerous, wasteful, and
unworkable.  It seems highly doubtful that any leader could make his way
through such a minefield and have the Congress enact a major health care
reform.

<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
</center>
<br>

<p>The health care debate reveals a dilemma for democracy and public
debate that is far from new but growing greater with time.  The issues
that a modern government must face seem increasingly complicated.  Health
care affords an apt illustration.  In addition, the quality of
debate--although richer in information than before--is more confusing as
more and more voices enter in, many of them highly partisan with goals
quite different from the pursuit of truth and the public interest.  Under
these circumstances, the burden on the voters to understand the issues and
arrive at an informed opinion are greater than ever, precisely at a time
when voters are increasingly disinterested in government and cynical about
the value of citizen participation.

<p>Ideally, the inherent complexity of the issues calls for greater trust
in elected representatives to work out enlightened solutions with the
public concentrating more on electing the best and ablest candidates to
serve them.  Instead, because the public so distrusts the legislature,
lawmakers rely increasingly on public opinion to guide their action, which
in turn leads interest groups to devote more money and effort to
mobilizing grass-roots opinion for their own advantage.

<p>What opportunities are there to improve matters?  Not an easy question.
Inspired leadership is always to be desired but hardly something one can
count on to offer more than temporary, occasional relief.

<br><br>

<p>Is there anything that would restore public confidence--not to the
point of uncritical gullibility--but to a level sufficient to allow
elected officials some leeway in enacting measures to deal with complex
problems?  Two things might restore some trust and confidence; it is hard
to think of others.  One is some demonstrable success in coping with a
series of major national problems; the other is a prolonged period of
economic prosperity (and even this does not seem to be working at
present).  Neither is something one can easily bring about by purposeful
action.

<p>Is there some way of making policy proposals using voices other than
those of politicians that would command greater trust from the public?
Bipartisan commissions with eminent members represent one way that has
been tried, occasionally with success.  Universities have done something
of this kind in the health care field by issuing newsletters on health
problems that try to give reasoned summaries of what is known and not
known to counteract the swirl of confusing reports about so many medical
questions.  Are there adaptations of this principle that might work for at
least some issues of public policy, such as global warming?

<p>A second question worth exploring is whether there is some way of
creating more useful, informative discussion in the media. As economists
have shown, market forces will lead to underinvestment in public affairs
discussion because private firms cannot capture the social value in a
democracy of increased public enlightenment on policy questions.  As a
result, one can argue that greater investments are needed--considerably
greater than the amounts allocated to public affairs broadcasting on NPR
or public television.  Can one imagine a way of creating and financing
programming that could help offset the tendency in the media--as
illustrated in the health care debates--to veer off into a preoccupation
with tactics and political conflict?  Could such programming be kept
objective and free from political influence?  Could it be made interesting
enough to capture a reasonable segment of the viewing audience?

<p>Finally, shouldn't we recognize the importance of having citizens be
informed about public issues and respond to the growing apathy and
cynicism of the public by making much more determined efforts to prepare
Americans as citizens?  Clearly, this is a task that has been neglected in
recent decades.  In schools, it is sacrificed to the preoccupation over
preparing a workforce for the global economy.  In universities, it is
rarely discussed as an explicit aim of undergraduate or professional
education.  In the media, civic journalism has confronted the issue
directly, but there is much opposition from powerful sources.

<p>What has never been tried is a concerted effort at all levels to
recognize active citizenship as a major goal of democratic society to be
pursued simultaneously at many levels and in many forms.  Perhaps the most
important opportunity for effective leadership on the part of the
President and other key political leaders is to put this challenge on the
agenda and stimulate an active discussion in many quarters on how
citizenship and civic virtue can best be cultivated and strengthened
throughout American society.
