<p>

TRILLIN:  There's Kathleen over there.
<p>
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON:  Would your proposal for Junior ROTC exclude the
student whose sexual orientation is different from the mainstream
orientation?
<p>
BECTON:  No.
<p>
JAMIESON:  Would that put the model at severe disadvantage in
relationship to the military model?
<p>
BECTON:  No.  The Junior ROTC is not designed to be a
recruiting device.  It's not designed to be a training
device for basic training.  It's not designed to be anything
but to help the school to be able to teach a little bit of civics,
bring about a little bit of discipline, bring about a whole array of
things that are good, that will provide, I think, a win-win situation.
And so one's sexual orientation in high school, I don't think, should
be a bar to their participation in Junior ROTC.
<p>
Yes, sir.
<p>
PAUL VERKUIL:  General, thank you for that very helpful
discussion.  I think one question I have, and that comes back to
your idea of national service--how practical is it?  I know
certainly some of us have sort of been through the era of the draft
and understood the quality that you discussed
about how important it is to, really, to level people together in
a commitment to public service, whether it's the military or not.  But
today we seem to be facing cutbacks in the military, which may even
jeopardize existing programs which seem to be working well, at least
in terms of diversity.  How are we going to find the will and, I
suppose, the economic support for a program that would not only
maintain but extend national service in a time when we seem to be
cutting back so dramatically on all these fronts?
<p>
BECTON:  I think I said it's gonna be a tough call by someone,
and I agree with that.  But I also think that we have gotten away
from, as a nation,  from having our youngster to have an obligation or
feel an obligation to anything.  I believe this is a way to do that.
This is simply saying that `Youngster, you owe your country
something.' I see too much today in our high schools or junior high
schools where there is no recognition of owing anyone, and somehow I
believe we've got to find a way to turn it around.  This obviously is
not the only way.  This just happened to be one of the ways which
I think will work.
<p>
And we're not just talking about bringing them into the military.
We're talking about a whole array of things, and this has been
discussed from time before.  I can recall in another reincarnation
as a young student at Temple University--pardon me, ma'am--I
was on active duty, but I took a few hours in the summertime, because
I'm a slow learner.  I took my first college course in 1946 and I
finally got my degree in 1960.  But in this period of the
'40s--late '40s and early '50s, we were talking about military
service or universal service, and it was in vogue in the community of
academics to find out ways of making it happen.  And, of course, it
fell because of, I suspect, a lot of feeling about Korea.  But that
did not remove, in my judgment, the reason for coming up with
something to help our youngsters understand.
<p>
TRILLIN:  General, I have a question about--looking at it
from the outside, it appears that various branches of the services
have had various success in integrating, if that's the word, the
diverse...
<p>
BECTON:  Yes.
<p>
TRILLIN:  ...population that they now have.  Would that be, in your
view, partly having to do with their differing missions or their
differing cultures or their differing histories, or
what?
<p>
BECTON:  I think all of that.
<p>
TRILLIN:  Oh.
<p>
BECTON:  I can only talk with any expertise about the
Army, but I think I can at least look across to Ralph and my friends
in the Navy, and you have an entirely different culture there, where
for a very, very long time, the only thing black America could do in
the Navy was be in the kitchen.  Well, when you're on board a ship,
that's very confining, and you know where they are.
<p>
In the Army, it's difficult; we don't have one little ship.  They
spread all over.  And they also have an opportunity to prove they can
do things all over, and I think you have that as a
standard that we could, given the opportunity, take the Army--the
Army's big breakthrough came at the Bulge in 1944, when the commanders
in the field realized that `We gotta get more people, more manpower,'
and they got a whole bunch of black units back there who were not
carrying rifles to shoot at anybody, except each other, I guess, but
they could become effective.  And they asked for volunteers.  And, as
you probably read, at least in the reading assignment by Charles
Moskos, they formed platoons.  And, by God, they found out that when
those black soldiers were brought up there, they did well.
<p>
I think that the Army got in the forefront because it recognized it
had a bigger problem.  We have more of them, and because of that, they
decided they better do something about it.  In 1972-73, as a young
brigadier general, the Chief of Staff of the Army said, `I've had it
with this lack of racial harmony.  I expect every general officer to
attend a 2 1/2-day course, seminar, on equal opportunity.' And I told
the Chief as kindly as I could, since I was his youngest
brigadier and he was a four-star--`Sir, I don't need that.' And he
said, basically, `Read my lip' before George Bush said it; `I will be
there and you will be there.'
<p>
And it forced every senior officer in the Army to attend this two-day
seminar.  That message went throughout the Army, because guess what?
When you got the generals and the colonels going, guess who else is
gonna learn?  I'm not too sure--I am, really--the Navy didn't do that.
The Air Force, they came along different.  As you know, they had the
first black four-star in Chappie James.  Dynamite of a soldier, but he
also was a leader to help people to do things the right way.  And I am
happy to
say, I have my youngest daughter is a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force.
She went to Leheigh, but that's all right.  Yes ma'am.
<p>
JOYCE APPLEBY:  I appreciated very much what you had to say about how
essential it is that we recommit ourselves to our public education system
and that we are in danger of
losing successive generations if we don't attend to this really great
need that you referred to as an education deficit.  What seems so
troubling is I think that all of us would agree that the neglect of
the schools is a fundamental problem with the
ramifications that you can hardly estimate, and yet we're in a
political environment where there doesn't seem to be the will to spend
the money that would be necessary.
<p>
Now along with the education deficit, there once was
something called the peace dividend, and there was the hope that
perhaps as you cut back on defense budgets, there would be the money
available for domestic programs that had been neglected.  I wonder if
you think there's any possibility that we could extract anything
from that defense budget that would free up tax moneys for schools,
for a fundamental recommitment to our public education throughout the
nation?
<p>
And secondly, perhaps even more importantly, are there officers in the
service like you who see the education deficit as having a
fundamentally malign influence upon our readiness, our
military readiness?
<p>
BECTON:  Let me not talk about extracting money from the
Department of Defense, because I really don't know that much
about--I've been out of the military now for 14 years.  I can read,
like everyone else, and I see their budget going down.  I also
recognize the readiness got to find a way to keep going up.  But let
me talk about the latter portion.  We have within the District of
Columbia 146 schools, and we're trying to get partners for all of our
schools, and we do.  I have some schools that have 40 and 50 partners,
and of course, they're in the nice part of town.  I have other schools
that have one and two partners, and they're in a tough part of town.
I have turned to my friends in the Department of Defense and asked
them for help, and they have come through.  I have partners from the
Navy, I have partners from the Air Force, I've got partners from the
Defense Intelligence Agency; couple of my schools have
soldiers--two soldiers in the school every day to help.
<p>
Now that is a very, very minor portion of what I'm talking about, but
I still believe that we can find ways to expand that, not just within
my district or Bud Spillane's district, but expand it throughout the
country, because we have military activity, military units--if nothing
else, the National Guard; we're in this beautiful place--National
Guard--that are available to help our schools, that could help our
schools if given the authority and a push and some indication that
they can expect approval from on high.  I think it's
possible.
<p>
Yes, sir.
<p>
THOMAS BENDER:  I see.  Now realizing that you've been out of
the military for 14 years, this might not be a question you
can answer directly, but I think you started to touch on this when
you were talking about values.  The question I have--there's
a lot of discussion today about why people are pulling away from a
kind of public concern.  A lot of it has to do with the notion of
rapid social change and uncertainty, and it at least in some
people's minds, this produces a kind of tribalism in the United States
and, I guess, in other places.  Of course, one could turn it the
other way, that all these changes and uncertainties can be
emancipatory, can allow people to break traditional forms.
<p>
One of the things that intrigues me about the military is the kind of
successes in integrating a huge number of very diverse people in the
last 20 years or so--is that that has coincided with a period of
unbelievable change in the military; that is, a demographic change;
that is, a mission change; that is, a status change within the
United States, and a whole new notion of how one becomes a
military person with the so-called volunteer Army.
And I'm just wondering whether you see all of these changes as
something that helped facilitate the work that has been
accomplished, or whether these kinds of changes produced levels of
defensiveness, tension, uncertainty, that were counterproductive
and made it even more difficult?
<p>
BECTON:  I think you'll find the leadership--the military
leadership no different than leadership in industry or higher ed or
whatever, to recognize that change is difficult is come by.  The one
thing that they have different in the military that we don't have,
say, in my current job--as a soldier, I could stand up in front of my
command and say, `Thou shall not,' `Thou shall,' and they got a
choice:  They can do it or get out.  I can't do that over in this
city.  I would love to, but I can't.  And so you've gotta find
something else.  But at least in the military, we have our marching
orders, we have our standards, and since it is a volunteer force,
those that sign up are expected to do it, or they can be released.
<p>
I don't have an easy answer, but I do recognize that the military
structure, I think, is on the right side of what they're doing,
compared to the rest of society, and they're not the least bit
reluctant to attack that animal, whatever it may be.  Keep in mind the
military--when I was a brigadier general back in 1972, I was the
sixth ever fellow of color to receive flag rank.  For the next 10
years, I probably knew every black officer who became a general.
Today I haven't the foggiest idea who they are, and I think that's
good.  We have on active duty at least 31 black generals--on active
duty.
<p>
With that type of structure throughout the forces, it becomes very
difficult for someone who has a mind to be different than what is
required or needed to act out, because someone is there.  Not that you
got--oh, black looking out for black; you got soldier looking out for
soldiers.  And the same thing could be true of women.  We have a
lieutenant general, female, in the Army today.  The Navy has one.  The
Marine Corps has one.  Fifteen years ago, if you were to say that or
suggest that, they would have thought you'd lost your mind.  But
we're growing up, and we recognize that talent comes.
Talent is there.  Let's be smart enough to use it.  And I think that's
what the Department of Defense has done; at least the Army has.
<p>
Yes, sir.
<p>
MARTIN SELIGMAN:  General, you've changed my mind about an
important issue.  Let me say what...
<p>
BECTON:  Is that good or bad?
<p>
SELIGMAN:  No, I think it's good.  You opened a hopeful
possibility for me.  Before your talk, I confess I thought something
like the following:  that an organization whose basic mission had
to do with dying and killing and fighting was well-suited to the
learning of discipline but ill-suited to the learning of values.  But
then, in the course of your talk, I think what I saw was that if,
as a young person, every day, you're confronted with issues of life
and death, of fighting, of killing, of the possibility of dying, that
this may be a much better crucible for the formation of moral values
than the abstract value limbo that our undergraduates are in day by
day.  So I wonder if I could get you to muse on the function that the
military has through bringing people face-to-face with the
most basic existential issues for value formation?
<p>
BECTON:  Fortunately, we're not fighting every day in a war,
but by the same token, in the back of the minds of every soldier is
the requirement that he must go out and fight sometime--that he may be
called upon.  And if you take a look at our formations that we've had,
our operations--and I've lost track of how many we've had in the last
10 years, but we've got soldiers in harm's way today in many parts of
the world--you develop a sense of value.  You develop a feeling of
comradeship.  You develop a reliance upon that guy or gal adjacent to
you who may have to be there to defend you as you defend them.
<p>
At Prairie View, where we had about 6,000 students, in Texas, the only
thing they'd defend themselves against was what they were gonna do
when they go to a weekend, and the football team didn't do well that
way.  And I only mention it because some of you are aware of the fact
that Prairie View has now 78 consecutive losses.  There's a long story
behind that.  I won't bore you with it, but I was the guy who stopped
football for one year.  And to do that in Texas--well, never mind.
<p>
But I understand and I agree with what you're saying, that I think we
can be a test tube or a crucible; not that the military should
become a social motivator.  That's not what I'm suggesting.  But I am
suggesting it can lead the way.  And I think they've done it fairly
well.
<p>
Yes, sir.
<p>
ROBERT WIEBE:  I'd like to ask you to return to the high schools and to an
issue you raised in terms of a generation coming of age that has no
sense of giving something back to its country.  That's something that
the commission is concerned about, too--the difficulty of finding,
even imagining, ways in which the current American society might share
common values that would be called loyalty to their country or the
like.  And you offered a prescription of a kind of local model ROTC
that would instill that.  I missed the gap.  I don't see where the
values are coming from.  I could see things like discipline and I
could see camaraderie;  I can envisage a number of different
things coming out of the ROTC model.  I don't know where the values
are coming from.  Maybe you can help us.
<p>
BECTON:  Our Junior ROTC, in addition to talking about
discipline, are able to talk about deportment.  They
have role models in all of the Junior ROTCs that are good.  They are
forced to consider teamwork, working together.  They learn a respect,
and that's part of discipline, but a respect for authority.  They have
a chance to see both girl and boy are successful; as a matter of fact,
in some of our Junior ROTCs, we have more girls than boys.  They are
able to get away from the gang culture, at least in the District of
Columbia.  They're able to do things as a group for the community.
None of the things I mentioned is precluded from other groups, but
they are there.  They're visible.  They're in uniform.  And they are
effective.
<p>
Now I'm gonna ask for help, because Bud has more Junior ROTCs than I
have.  What have I missed?
<p>
ROBERT SPILLANE:  Well, I don't know if I can help more.
You've already done such a marvelous job of everything so
far today, but I do think that in schools, there is an initial
tendency for youngsters who may need discipline, poor youngsters,
youngsters of color, to join the Junior ROTCs, and it's been a real
phenomenon, I think, in a county like a Fairfax County, which is
probably one of the richest counties in the United States, but it is
very, very diverse; 179 nations, 100 languages being spoken.  And it
brings a value system there because of the different types
of youngsters that go into it, and it started, as I said, at
probably more poor youngsters, more of the undisciplined
youngsters, who are kind of 'You ought to go to Junior ROTC or, you
know, may not make it out of here, or get some good counseling
somewhere along the way.'
<p>
But it has, in the last several years, grown toward a
stature where other types of youngsters--youngsters who are
absolutely--well, 90 percent of the youngsters go to college anyway
from even that system--but youngsters who will be going into Ivy
League schools have joined the Junior ROTC.  So it doesn't
get directly to where the values come from, but the values start to
grow because you have so much diversity, and the youngsters are
bringing those values from their home, from others, and
there's a sense of value that probably develops at the Junior
ROTC level.
<p>
WIEBE:  I think I probably wasn't careful enough in phrasing the query.
I can see character formation and socialization in some local setting.
I don't see where the values that provide a hope for national unity,
for a new patriotism, for a sense of connectedness with one's country
or one's broader society--maybe that's a spin-off of good character
formation, I mean, maybe that's what you're telling me.  But that sense
that there is a generation coming of age that doesn't feel an
attachment to America...
<p>
SELIGMAN:  But, Bob, what if winning...
<p>
WIEBE:  ...I just don't know how the A leads to B.  That was
really--but I'm glad to hear about the character formation.
<p>
SELIGMAN:  Bob, what if winning and losing, living and dying, killing
and fighting are hothouses that accelerate the formation of values?
<p>
WIEBE:  In a high school ROTC...
<p>
TRILLIN:  Judy has a question.
<p>
JUDITH RODIN:  I just want to comment on Marty's point, because I think in
at least two of the positions that you've had, you would
argue the opposite thing.  I think you're right, Marty, in
characterizing the military as perhaps a hotbed for the formation of
values for the reasons you characterize, but we can all think of
junior high schools and elementary schools where issues of life and
death are equally palpable every day and are the antithesis, the
anathema, to value formations.  So, I mean, there's a
differentiating factor here that I think we need to be mindful of
and not push that analogy too far.
<p>
My question is this; you talked a lot about race relations in the
Army, at least, and diversity, and you mentioned a variety of
variables that might be causal, and maybe it's all of them, but I'd
like to push you a little harder to maybe select those that you
think are most important.  You talked about discipline and regulation
and expectation, that there really are prescribed ways to behave that
if you deviate from, there really are consequences, and everybody
knows that in advance.  You talked about combat and the nature of
combat really being a leveler in terms of differences among people,
and you also talked about the fact that the Army, and maybe the
military more generally, is a meritocracy, so that if people have a
level playing field, regardless of skin color or whatever, they really
can rise by virtue of their merit and qualification.
<p>
Which of those is really important?  Can we generalize from that
to things that we can do in the broader society?  And if all of them
are true, why aren't women doing well?
<p>
BECTON:  I'm not too sure--and I had a discussion about this
last night, as a matter of fact--that women are doing all that poorly.
<p>
BECTON:  I think what we see is that the problems that we're
finding in sexual harassment, sexual misconduct--they're not occurring
in the units; they're occurring in a training base.  They are
occurring where you got the--a transient; youngsters coming in, the
old-boy net, the old cadre; aha!  They got a target over there.  And
we're trying to do something about that.  And I think the Army can fix
that.  But when you get beyond that training base, you get out to the
units, you'll find women are doing very well.  And I think the number
will point that out.
<p>
But remember also, the women also came at a time when you still have a
question on the minds of some people:  Should they
have the same standards?  I happen to believe that there's no reason
to expect a woman to do the same amount of push-ups as a guy.  Their
bodies are different.  But that doesn't mean that they're any less
qualified.
<p>
I was in charge of physical fitness for the Army in my last
assignment, and we had some interesting standards to deal with.  One,
we were able to get our soldiers out of combat boots.  Now some of you
may not remember, but the Army used to run in combat boots, and the
reason for it was because we always fought in combat boots.  Well,
that's a dumb answer.  Running is for something different.  Put on
running shoes.  And we'd got 'em in there.
<p>
But you've seen these ladders that go rung to rung; my old-boy
cadre said, `We cannot move the arm closer because it'd make it too
easy.' If you're gonna go from one end to the other end, whether
you've got 20 or 30 doesn't make any difference.  But if we move them
closer to each other, you help the women, because they can't make that
big adjustment.  Again, a standard that didn't make a lot of sense.
<p>
I am suggesting that there are a lot of things that we can do to make
an adjustment for gender.  The Air Force made an amazing discovery.
They have the great big toolboxes and they gotta carry it from plane
to plane.  And they said, `Well, the women can't carry that.' Well,
someone said, `Why, give 'em a dolly, something to pull on.  How much
more is that gonna cost?  Not much.'
<p>
Are we willing to go and get out of that box that we've been in?
And I would submit that, in too many cases, we're not, particularly
outside of the military.
<p>
TRILLIN:  We're running close to our time.  We're gonna
give--Cass, you wanna go last--he's famous for his push-ups.
I was gonna give him the last question, but if not...
<p>
BECTON:  I did my 50 this morning.
<p>
TRILLIN:  And so did he, General, I assure you.
<p>
BECTON:  Well, that's why he's...
<p>
TRILLIN:  So did we all.  If not, I want to thank you for coming,
and for a presentation that was enlightening to all of us.  Thank
you.
<p>
BECTON:  Thank you.
<p>
RODIN:  Let me just do a little bit of housekeeping.  What we've done
is really tried to bring together, from our last three meetings,
including today's, a series of six or seven--are we up to seven,
Steve?--seven sets of statements and concepts and precepts that will
really be, I think, quite helpful in guiding our lunchtime discussion.
It tries to organize what we've said, what the recommendations have
been from the plenary sessions and thinking from some of the
working groups, and I think--and we'll hand these out now so that you
can look at them.
<p>
We'll take a break before lunch, and then at lunch, we can use
the occasion to review these, discuss them, and each of them, I think,
will stimulate us to organize some of the many suggestions we've had
about potential next steps in several of these areas, and I think we
ought to try to come to some conclusions about potential next steps in
these areas and recognize that any decision we make
today is up for change, that this an iterative process because, of
course, the working groups will keep meeting and our deliberations
will continue.  But the sense that there may be already outcomes
that we wish to move towards is something that we all feel or many
of us feel strongly, and we at least should have the occasion now to
deliberate about that while recognizing that we move forward and
will have others as well.
