More than two hundred years ago, our Colonial predecessors developed some
unique mechanisms of communication
and collective intellection as they grappled their way toward, first,
independence, and later, towards more effective
forms of governance. Through dozens of "Committees of Correspondence," the
soon-to-be revolutionary leaders
shared information, insights, and opinions among the thirteen colonies, as
the conflict with Great Britain developed. 
<p>
These private conversations, carried on over what were then great
distances and differences of circumstance, attitudes,
and politics, began the process of binding together the future leaders of
a single nation. Indeed, a majority of the
delegates to the First Continental Congress were members of the Committees
of Correspondence. 
<p>
On this garden trellis of communication grew the foliage of revolutionary
ideas that would eventually reach full flower
in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and Bill of Rights,
and another unique exercise in the power of
ideas: The Federalist Papers. But what is most remarkable about this
period is the degree to which ideas and rational
debate were the stuff and substance of public discourse. 
<p>
Today, new technologies such as the Internet offer the potential to create
modern parallels--on a global scale--to these
Colonial patterns of communication and rational discourse. 
<p>
In some ways, our Colonial predecessors had it easy. By and large, they
already shared a common intellectual tradition.
As men of the English Enlightenment, they were already committed to both
the form and substance of rational debate.
They believed passionately in the power of reason to inform and guide
human behavior, the uniqueness of the nascent
American nation, and the naturalness of the rights they espoused. They had
the wonderful advantage of living in the
first dawn of a clearly defined intellectual era, an era that they helped
to give concrete form, and an era that-- almost
--swept away much that is problematic, unruly, violent, and irrational in
human behavior. 
<p>
Alas, for us, it is not so simple. We live in the twilight of their era.
We live with the horrors of the 20th century. We
live in a world that--though it still values the forms of Enlightenment
reason and government--seems to have forgotten
their substance. Their simple and appealing faith in the reasonableness of
every individual, the power of ideas to shape
the world for good, and the ability of argument to sway and control
passions seems almost quaint. Indeed, we live in a
time when the world our ancestors created seems to have turned upon
itself. The very tradition they helped to develop is
itself at issue in many of the conflicts with which we are confronted. 
<p>
Some respond to this situation by trying to restore a mythic past. Others
reject all that has come before. Either way, the
rest of us are deprived of the common framework we need to wrestle
intelligently with the issues of the day-- and with
each other. That makes our task substantially tougher than that of our
Colonial predecessors. But it may also provide us
with clues to the nature of the profound cultural and intellectual crisis
through which some believe we are living. 
<p>
If that is the case, then there is no better period to which we might turn
for guidance than Colonial America. There are
important lessons to be drawn from this period. These lessons have guided
us in conceiving of this Commission. I
hope they will remain at the heart of our collective effort. 
<p>
First among these lessons is the critical importance of leadership. It
took individual leadership and initiative to form the
Committees of Correspondence, to state publicly what were then treasonable
political views, and to foment a revolution
as much of ideas as of politics, national identity, or economics. The
importance of leaders has motivated us to assemble
as members of this Commission academic leaders of every stripe and opinion
and widely divergent expertise. To this
we have added leaders in journalism, business, politics, and
literature--and we expect to add more as our work
progresses. Around the Commission itself, we hope to build two concentric
networks--one of the hundreds of writers,
academics, and opinion leaders who could not be included, but whose views
and reactions to our work can make
important contributions to its evolution. Think of them as our own
"committee of correspondence" if you will. And, as
our ideas develop, we also plan to reach out to emerging leaders in many
fields; to share with them the ideas and
insights we are developing--both to test them and to begin the process of
outreach and dissemination of the
Commission's work. 
<p>
The second lesson we can draw from the Colonial period is the importance
of dialogue. After all, it was in the
exchanges of the Committees of Correspondence, the debates of the
Continental Congresses, and writings of Federalist
and anti-Federalist alike, that the common framework of a nation was
formed. We may not be able to recreate that
framework, but we can take away the lesson that only in serious and
continuing dialogue can a new framework be
fashioned. Throughout our work, the creation of a continuing and fruitful
dialogue will be essential. First, among the
members of the Commission itself--as we have begun over the past two days.
Second, between the Commission
members and the wider network of interested contributors and commentators.
And finally, with emerging leaders and
those who must in the end put our ideas to work. In creating and
sustaining this dialogue, we hope to use all the rapidly
evolving technologies of the Internet and global communications to ease,
support, and enhance our work. 
<p>
And finally, running through both of these lessons is an even more
fundamental insight: an appreciation of the power
and saliency of ideas. Ideas in the minds and voices of leaders. Ideas
shared and debated in passionate and articulate
dialogue. Ideas set loose to change the world in the way that only ideas
can. It is first and foremost with the content of
ideas that we will be concerned. First, in understanding the ideas that
drive the phenomena we have explored only in a
preliminary way in this first meeting. Second, in offering new ideas,
interpretations and con-ceptualizations to reframe
public discourse. And finally, by putting those ideas to work in the
public sphere, initially through leaders and later,
hopefully, by engaging the general public. . . . 
<p>
Our intention is to pursue this task in three phases: 
<p>
First, by commissioning original scholarly analyses of a variety of
contemporary issues to clarify their intellectual and
historical roots. We think of this process as "peeling back the onion" to
identify the ideas and commitments that are at
the heart of contemporary conflict and discord. 
<p>
But merely identifying the sources of polarization and ideological
commitment will not be sufficient. We must then look
for the commonalties across issues. From this we may discern in our
discussions -- and explore through thematic
analyses -- the larger shape of the cultural and intellectual crisis
through which we seem to be living. Finally, with a
deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics, we should be able to
frame some new interpretions and
conceptualizations of contemporary conflicts in ways that open them to new
possibilities of rational debate and
respectful disagreement. 
<p>
The ideas in conflict around us are too fundamental to be amenable to
simplistic solutions or moralistic exhortations.
But I do believe that ideas are never stagnant. Dialogue, creativity, and
leadership have the capacity to put new ideas
and new ways of thinking into play at any moment. . . . 
<p>
Like the debates and exchanges of the Colonial era, we hope to stimulate
within and around the Commission a process
that might truly be called "collective intellection." 
<p>
Out of this process, we will create and distribute a variety of
educational and informational materials: as publications,
videos, CD-ROMs, or in other emerging formats, as well as--of course--on
our own World Wide Web site. We want to
take full advantage of the unprecedented opportunities offered by the
rapid evolution of new interactive technologies
and instant global communicatons. 
<p>
Through all these means, we hope to share our ideas with those wider
networks of interested colleagues, emerging
leaders, and ultimately, with the general public. Not as moralistic
imperatives or didactic solutions, but as elements of a
useful, new vocabulary for thinking seriously about things that really
matter in our society and in our lives. 
<p>
Along the way, we also hope to create a new model for serious and
productive inter-disciplinary and multi-professional
communication. And we want to demonstrate--concretely and
realistically--that professional and scholarly leaders can
be brought together to make a real collective contribution to the daily
life of our society. 
<p>
But to do that, first must come the ideas-- and the hard intellectual work
that we have begun . . . .
