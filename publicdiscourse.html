Celebrating the Conversation:  Public Discourse in Action Lunchtime
Presentation
<p>
Mr. STEVE STEINBERG:  ...lunchtime conversation, and we'll give you
other opportunities to continue it.  I--they will continue to serve
coffee.  I know that when I listen to an after-lunch speaker, I'm
always sitting there saying, `Where's the coffee?' about halfway
through.  So I--I've asked them to continue to serve that.
<p>
Like many of you, I have--full of metaphors and images of--cinematic
metaphors after this morning's conversation, and two of them are
competing in my mind.  One is the--the image of the track star
settling into the blocks, watching the officials raise the bar that he
or she has to jump over.  And I think as I listened to the
conversation this morning, it got more and more daunting.  The other
image, and I--perhaps it's a better one, is of the young screenwriter
who's finally gotten a meeting with a producer in Hollywood--and, of
course, there's an--an art to this that Neal can tell us more
about--and has exactly 60 seconds to make his pitch.
<p>
Well, here comes the pitch.  And I--like the screenwriter, what I'm
going to try and do is give you the plot.  Many of you have commented
that the Commission process, which has now gone on for three years,
has been hard sometimes to get a sense as to how the pieces fit
together.  And I think that's been true for Commission members.  The
staff certainly has worked very hard to try and--and do that, but
because of the nature of the process, we thought it would be useful at
this juncture, as we make the transition that President Rodin
described this morning, to try and highlight the plot, where we've
been, where we're going, and what we are trying to achieve.
Necessarily, this'll be very schematic.  There's a lot of substance
behind each of these bullets that we obviously can't talk about, but I
hope it will be helpful.
<p>
So here's the story line.  We have talked within the Commission for
three years amongst Commission members.  We're now, as many of you
here represent, widening that conversation, with media, with the
public, with our guests.  And we are moving into a public programming
phase of the Commission project, where we hope to take what we have
learned and put it to work.  In a sense--we were talking after the
presentation this morning--what we want to do is help people say no,
say yes, or say `It's more complicated than that,' if that's
what--what they need to be saying.
<p>
Just to remind you of where we began, in 1994 and '5, there was a
widespread sense of the deterioration and decline crisis in public
culture, in lots of different spheres:  in the media, in politics and
so forth.  We have summarized those perceptions in this way:  that
discourse was highly polarized, uncivil, unproductive; that leaders
were too timid, that they were following their constituencies rather
than leading; very importantly, that communal life seemed to be
increasingly fragmented; that communities and subcommunities had a
great deal of difficulty bridging the barriers that separate them and
reintegrating; and that public moires, tolerance of differences and
self-restraint had really begun to break down, and at that particular
moment, there was a sense, really, that this was deteriorating very
rapidly; and finally, as we talked extensively in Los Angeles last
December, that the boundaries between private and public spheres of
our lives and of our officials' lives and of our culture had really
begun to disappear.
<p>
Talking about that situation, we designed a project that had at least
three major goals.  One was to bring academic resources to bear on
this major social and cultural issue.  Another was to demonstrate what
we believed to be the essential connections between theory and
practice, that we should not silo our knowledge in the academic
setting, but find new ways, since the old ways seemed not to be
working, to bring it to bear in the public sphere.  And finally:  that
we could perhaps reinvent, as a number of you have reminded us, the
notion of what a national commission or a study group of this sort
could do.  And that's one of the reasons, as Dr. Rodin described this
morning, we decided and promised you at the very beginning we would
not just write a report, give it to somebody else and tell them what
to do, and then go home.
<p>
So what have we learned?  We've learned--we--we came to the conclusion
very early on, and we heard it again this morning:  that incivility is
not new, that the signs of incivility and unproductive discourse and
the coarseness of culture has always been there in a portion of at
least the American culture, probably of all cultures; that this is not
a new phenomenon.  What is clear, however, is that it is more loudly
amplified, that it seems more dominant.  But the phenomenon itself is
not new.  I did an interview a few weeks ago in which a reporter asked
whether something had changed, and I gently pointed out that human
nature has not changed in the last five, 10, 15 years.  What's clearly
changed is the culture and the context in which these behaviors
are--are be--are going on.
<p>
Secondly, we a--in talking about that, we concluded that public
discourse has been thinned by the same fundamental social forces that
Mr. Gabler was describing this morning:  technology, mass
communications, mass markets, mass entertainment, globalization,
urbanization; take your pick.  Those are forces that we are not going
to roll back in any fundamental sense, at least in the near--near
future.
<p>
Thirdly, we concluded that an engaged and productive public discourse
is of central impors--importance to a democratic society.  We tried to
restate and articulate that a year ago.  I want to underscore its
relationship to the notion of community and the way in which a
democratic community functions, its inclusiveness and its ability to
engage in a productive discourse as the heart of what holds a
community together.
<p>
We articulated the need to thicken public discourse by stimulating
more, for shorthand, good discourse around the bad, rather than just
trying to suppress the bad.  And, with David Ryfe's help, we found
that good public discourse probably means something different.  And we
heard it again this morning.  I--I've said to Neal that he was right
on target in terms of many of the things we'd been talking about,
and--and it is very evident.  The aim in our review of the--of the
literature in many of our discussions is to promote a good public
discourse that integrates the rational, the argumentative, the
deliberative, the appeal to evidence with the other notions of
representation and reciprocity and respect that we've given the rough
title of relationality to.  A good discourse consists of both of
those, and the task is to integrate them in a way that is functional
for a democratic society.
<p>
Finally, we saw, through the work of the leadership group and our
discussions in a number of settings, that effe--that in effective
discourse, leadership is extremely important, that we need to focus on
the whole issue of discourse leadership, along with all the other
things that we train leaders to do, and that a new set of
institutions--museums, foundations, universities--have begun to emerge
as the core, as the instrument, for fostering inclusive discourse
communities.
<p>
Now since we put that list together, I just want to highlight a few
findings that are in the research material that we made available for
this meeting, but I think they are very much congruent with what I've
just described.  One is the implication of Ian Lustick's simulation
study that small leadership ins--interventions may pr--may be very
important for improving discourse and stabilizing diverse communities.
I think that's an important results.  Mark Schultz's review of the
literature on forgiveness suggested that cognitive reappraisals of
painful experiences may, in fact, be able to foster forgiveness and
re--and reconciliation, and that some of the concerns that this might
dredge up painful memories and experiences that would then fester
might be--I believe his word was `overstated.'
<p>
And finally, the--we have identified a set of interesting new
discourse practices and programs that are beginning to emerge.  We
have representatives of s--of a number of those programs here with us
today.  We have also begun an examination that Graham Dodds is
carrying out of political apologies, which turns out to be an area
that has been unexplored.  And, as Joyce Appleby's report on the work
of the community in the 21st-century working group brought
for--brought forth very strongly, and as we saw in Los Angeles,
museums, universities, foundations and their role as the progenitors
as--if you will, of community, is going to be increasingly important.
<p>
With those findings in hand, that has led us to a--to articulate an
overarching strategic oja--objective for the work of the Commission as
fostering a more robust and engaged public discourse, and we have
essentially identified that as a more important concern, that
incivility and rudeness and crudeness.  And the task before us is to
make that kind of discourse, positive discourse, relevant--more
relevant than the crudeness, and ha--and use it to form substantial,
enduring and inclusive communities.
<p>
So how are we going to do that?  What can the Penn National Commission
contribute that doesn't duplicate the work of others and that can
facilitate the kind of integration of reason and narrative that we
have been describing?  We've concluded that the overarching goal for
that task is really the creation of a national movement around the
issues of public discourse and its role in the formation of community.
<p>
In this task, we th--we see f--in this task we see three major
challenges that have to be carried out.  One is to create a national
network of venues, of places.  Some of those already exist in
universities and museums and libraries and others--institutions, but
clearly, most of the people working in those environments are
isolated, and we hope to be able to stimulate the creation of more
such venues.  Secondly, the creation of a national cadre of discourse
leaders, of individuals in every walk of life, we--it--be it politics
or the media, be it lawyers, community leaders, journalists, who take
as part of their role as a community leader the facilitation of a
productive discourse and the leading of a productive conversation.
And finally, for ei--either of those to be effective, we clearly need
to create models, as Kathleen has emphasized repeatedly, of exemplary
discourse practices.  Without that, people will lose hope.  They will
not see that better behavior is possible.  I am mindful of the
comments that a number of you have made that people want to do better,
but they don't know how.  And the models of exemplary discourse,
putting them into practice, is a critical part of that task.
<p>
We've imagined three pieces in fulfilling tho--that agenda.  One is a
set of partnership programs in which we would create and are planning
to create, with professional, institutional, and membership and
community associations, joint programs that take the insights that you
have produced and work with them to put that into the language, the
media, the mechanisms of those various communities.  This may take the
form of leadership training, of materials, as well as direct discourse
programs, and clearly these partnerships will play a relationship--a
role in the larger exemplary discourse programs that I'll talk about
in a moment.
<p>
Many of you have commented, through the course of our work, that if we
don't focus on universities and the creation of good discourse
communities in universities--that, one, we will have no credibility,
and two, we will have missed an opportunity to have enormous impact
with a vehicle that is ready to hand.  So, as President Rodin
discussed this morning, the notion of the civically engaged university
has become one of the central elements in our thinking about how we go
forward.  We see the creation of discourse communities and discourse
leaders as part of the central aspect of all the civic engagements
that the leading universities of all kinds in the 21st century will
need to engender, the kind of civic engagement that will be the
hallmark of those institutions.
<p>
So colleges and universities are clearly natural discourse
venures--venues.  They are centers of multiple discourse communities,
both internal and external and bridging the ex--the internal and
external.  And finally, there are a number of national organizations
with whom we are beginning to develop partnerships; for example,
Campus Compact in the University of Pennsylvania, and the Commission
will host a president's leadership colloquium here next June on the
issue of civil engagement with the issues of productive public
discourse and creation of discourse communities at the heart of it.
<p>
Finally, going back to the notion of exemplifying good discourse
practices, we are in the early stages of imagining a set of public
programs, and as you know, we have brought a new staff member.  George
Stallay, who I hope many of you have had an opportunity to meet, on
board to help us with this.  Many of you have raised the idea of
citizens' debates around the occasion of the fall 2000 elections.  We
think that that is a very useful focus, that it--we can use it to link
the venues and the leaders and the other programs that we have in
mind.  Perhaps a theme for that would be the issue of citizens setting
the agenda, rather than relying on politicians to tell them what the
agenda should be.
<p>
We are developing programs for an annual discourse award and a report
card or a measure of the improvement of public discourse.  We think
the whole notion of national conversations needs to be reimagined.
This was one of the areas of discussion that was stimulated by Alex
Boraine's conversation with us in Los Angeles.  We think that
citizens' conversations are probably more important than leaders'
conversations.  And we are developing a--a strategy in conjunction
with these other elements to do that.  And then, clearly, there are a
whole set of materials, publications, videos, Internet resources,
coming out of the Commission.  Much of that already exists, but it
needs to be, and is being, edited and redesigned for a very different
audience.
<p>
And finally, looking a little farther ahead, there are the
opportunities to create partnerships with educators to work in the
schools, with human relations professionals who engage in this kind of
interaction every day, and with some of the exemplary discourse groups
who--that are with us today.
<p>
And I think it's apparent that part of this ongoing program needs to
be the continuation of some of our research endeavors.  The modeling
of leadership and discourse community interactions that Ian Lustick
has begun is clearly going to be very fruitful.  Graham Dodds' work on
political apologies, the work that Mark Schultz and the Solomon Asch
Center on--for the study of s--ethnopolitical conflict, on forgiveness
and reconciliation, clearly has much to teach us about how to be
effective.
<p>
Looking a little farther ahead, there are two areas that we really
haven't even begun to investigate very much, though some of you are
experts in them.  One is the--our international discourse programs.
We've looked at those domestically through David Ryfe's latest study.
But clearly there are international programs that would warrant the
same kind of attention.  And then the--the notion of large-scale
empirical measures of the improvement of public discourse, and we--we
h--there are a number of you who have expertise in that area that we
hope to draw on.
<p>
So to wrap this all up, we are imagining this a rebranding, if you
will, of the Commission's activity under perhaps a rubric like the
Penn Public Talk Project, which would be more accessible than the Penn
National Commission, and--though we will always make clear that is
based on the work of the Commission.  And just to show you how the
pieces fit together, the storyboard, I guess, would look something
like this, the goal being a national movement to improve the conduct
of public discourse as an--as a step towards the creation of stronger
communities, the means being the creation of networks, of venues,
discourse leaders and models of exemplary discourse programs,
partnership programs, public programs.  It is our expectation that, as
many of these are developed--that we will essentially create
free-standing spinoffs that would hopefully take on a life of their
own.
<p>
And I hope that--that it is clear that we see this kind of effort as
one of trying to create a movement much like was done with community
service in the '80s and '90s that takes on a life of its own.  We are
well aware that we can only do so much, that this is not the kind of
endeavor that any one organization or one program can control.  What
we hope to do is throw a frame around all the best practices and help
leverage those in a variety of settings:  the research--continuing
research program.  And then, clearly, we need to continue the
development of supporting materials and media and public relations
that support all of those activities.
<p>
So that's the story line.  That's my pitch.  And with that said, I
will ask President Rodin to moderate the discussion.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  You can moderate from there...
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Fine.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  ...comments and questions.  And this is very much in the
nascent stages, and so input is--is not only desirable; it's required
as we go forward, very much still in the formative period.  Please.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Jim.
<p>
JIM:  I think this is great.  But one question for possible further
reflection:  If the goal is a more robust rather than a thin public
discourse--as I gain weight I feel better about that--but I wanted to
focus...
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  You and I can talk about that later.
<p>
JIM:  I want to know what `robust' means.  Is it--is it more
representative, more inclusive, more informed, more communicative,
more ro--and robust--robust sounds good, but it--it could...
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  OK.
<p>
JIM:  There are different aims.  Do we want a more informed public?
Do we want a public that is--that understands and--and--and where
public--do we want more public spaces for public discussion?  How do
we make sure people are not left out?  I mean, there--there are so
many different dimensions of this, depending upon the meaning of
`robust.'
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Yeah.  I--I think it's very clear, from our earlier
discussions, from this morning, from the research, that what we want
and what we need are all of those things, that a discussion that is
just deliberative or just argumentative or just rational or just
appeals to evidence, is not the public discourse that we need.  At the
same time, a discussion that is totally devoted to the airing of
emotion, to narrative, to past experience is also inadequate.  The
task, as we see it, what a robust discourse consists in, is the
integration of those two models.
<p>
And I think that gives very real meaning to the notion that incivility
is not the issue, because that conversation may be very uncivil, may
have elements of rudeness and crudeness and profanity and all those
other things, but I think one of the key things that we have seen is
that, at least in some cases, it's that kind of robust conversation
that creates community, that you don't have a community set rules and
then have a conversation, because then there's nothing left to talk
about.  You have that conversation as an instrument to the creation of
community, which can then go on to set up its representative processes
and decision procedures and so forth.
<p>
So I think one of the important things that has come out of the
Commission's work is to understand the intimate tie between that kind
of robust discourse and the formation and strengthening of community.
Joel.
<p>
JOEL:  I just simply would ask you to underscore that, because, you
know...
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Yeah.
<p>
JOEL:  ...the--you said it when you talked about those
...(unintelligible) issues.  But if--if the notion there is that
public discourse is a means of creation of community or strengthening
or renewing the community, I think you ought to say that, because
that's really how we got into public discourse in the first place.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Right.  Right.  The--the point is very well taken,
and--and I think as you can well understand, we are sometimes so close
to this that things that--that we have built into our mind-set and our
understanding of it don't always get translated explicitly.  I think
one of the--well, th--that's--we will do that.
<p>
Unidentified Woman #1:  And one of the things that's easy to consider
is that people are much more likely to engage in a public discourse if
they think it's actually going to be effective around a particular
issue.  And yet, you have quite good models whereby, for instance, now
it's quite common in the UK for the government to found NGOs to
stimulate public discourse around a particular issue with the promise
that they will take seriously the issues that are raised in the
village halls, the community halls, etc.  So there's two things there.
One is that it needs to be public discourse that also can have some
power to influence, but it is also quite useful to have a tie-in
somewhere with a recognition by government and politicians themselves
that they value this.  And that is not easy, because politicians often
prefer to take their de--their decisions without the necessity to
consider the public discourse.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Steve...
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  I...
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  ...let me comment on that, too, because I didn't know
that that was the--the model in the UK, and--and I think that's
marvelous.  The model that I--I was working from in the United States
is the--is the model now in corporate America called workout, where
you will have really empowered employees dealing with a very specific
problem.  The discourse, as I've read some of the materials, is--is
extremely rich.  And then you have a commitment on the part of the
corporate leadership that's able, in fact, not only enact--not only
help plot the recommendations but that it will be the employees that
have the opportunity to enact those recommendations.
<p>
And we've been talking with a variety of elected officials, some in
very significant roles, who are engaged with us in the notion that
that might be a very interesting thing to try in American politics.
And so if we can enrich and now will have an example, which I--I would
appreciate knowing more about.  But that's precisely it.  It can't
be--even in our deliberations over the last three years, where we've
been most engaged, it has been really focused on issues and not just
theory or--or rhetoric.  And so we know that engaging in discourse
about real and serious issues where there is the capacity to make a
difference, and that difference is tangible, will move the will to
engage in a very different kind of discourse.  It's not just for its
own sake, which is quintilateral in abstraction.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  And--and I just should add, one of the things we've
heard very clearly in our conversations with many of you over the last
nine months is exactly that need, to make s--that a good conversation
has outcomes that aff--that people need to see will affect something
that they care about.  It starts with a concern that they have in what
Tom Rand has called work to do together, and it ends in effective
network.  And without that, something like the president's National
Conversation on Race is totally artificial.  And that's a--a great
challenge in reimagining the whole notion of national conversations in
a productive way.  No one, to my knowledge, has really quite been able
to do that.  It also needs to be localized and needs to be concrete.
So it's--you're very much aware of that ...(unintelligible).  Paul.
<p>
PAUL:  In that same spirit, without trying to, you know, anchor this
whole discussion on a real problem, which is crucial
...(unintelligible) but here's--here's one, and it has to do with the
apology and--and reconciliation.  Why don't we commit--now there's a
movement going on--the press is very anxious to get the--an apology as
an alternative to litigation, and at--at the--there's a national
level; there's legislation in Congress, there's state legislation to
achieve this.  You know, as you know, litigation is more
(unintelligible) means, and punitive damages is the neutron bomb.  And
what the press wants is an alternative of an apology, which eliminates
the neutron bomb.  Why don't we--that would be a good example of an
application where the press is now obviously very close to what we're
doing, where it's going to start apologizing more in order to save
itself from financial ruin.  That's all part of the larger picture
that we want ...(unintelligible).
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  I think that's exactly the kinds of ways in which
the--some of the research papers ties into the programmatic
development.  Like some said, it's a movement ...(unintelligible).
You and Jay Rosen and Graham Dodds certainly can put your heads
together and pursue that line in a hurry.  (Unintelligible) will be
quite unique.  Neal.
<p>
NEAL:  I think it's ...(unintelligible).  And I have only one item
that I'd like to raise a little question about, and that is are there
means to creating a national cadre of discourse leaders?  I became a
little nervous.  A little Orwellian, I'm afraid, in its sound, and at
the very least, a scene for (unintelligible).
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  OK.  Fair--fair enough.  I--I--I should say that, you
know, programmatically, one almost has to be a little Orwellian in
(unintelligible) but in a strategic ...(unintelligible) really
(unintelligible) very small leadership interventions can be very
useful, and all we want to do is help people out there in the
communities and in various ...(unintelligible) feel empowered, as we
talked about in our earlier meetings, to intervene, to structure a
conversation, to have some resources that they can look at and say,
`Oh, if you want to do this, you know, maybe deliver it
(unintelligible) issues.  If you want to do that, maybe a second set
of issues,' and so forth and so on.  One of the nice things, I think,
about where we've ended up is that we are not wedded to a particular
technique or format.  What we want to do is throw a frame around all
the good ways of approaching things, trying (unintelligible) and
support them, and not duplicate what others are--are already doing.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Steve, I think number two is not only a bit Orwellian,
but I think it runs counter to--to some of what we were saying this
morning, and what Bob Wevie was trying to say in talking about film.
If--if we are to look for the non-leader-only model, where we really
have a working communitarian view, and we want to create and empower
everyone, potentially anyone, to become a discourse leader.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  And I want to say...
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  And I think that's a--a--in fact, a more true
characterization of what our thinking is.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  A more Jacksonian ap--approach is--was my gut
reaction to what you were saying.  And that--that really, I--I think,
is a--I think that's why one of the kinds of groups that we want to
partner with are membership associations, like AARP and so forth,
with--that really carry that kind of member--or bring that kind of
membership forward as--as potential leaders and participants.  Jay?
<p>
JAY:  I find this very helpful, as a commissioner, to know what I've
been doing for the last three years.  Congratulations on that.  I'd
also like to see how the--how the Commission's worked the Public Talk
Project (unintelligible).
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Could you just speak up a little bit?  I can't--I
can't hear.
<p>
JAY:  That's OK.  I didn't say anything important.  I did have some
points.  The first one is, did you give any thought to creating a
journal that would be called Public Talk, and to provide a regular
forum for addressing the conceptual development here but also towards
comments of what--which could be done online or in some other form...
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  That--that journal exists online as the part of the
work of the Commission.  One of the things we will be looking at is
how to take that start--and, as you know, and we'll talk about it in a
little bit, online enterprises are hard to--to penetrate the mind-set
out there.
<p>
JAY:  Right.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Although we will be looking at where to go with that
initiative there, and to make it more visible.
<p>
JAY:  OK.  Good.  In that connection, I have a suggestion for you.
Under the three means you have create a national network, create a
national cadre of leaders and create models of exemplary discourses.
I think there's one other thing that you can do, which would be gain a
passkey to critique discourse practices as they arise and appear to
you to be ...(unintelligible).  And based on what you've said are the
lessons of this Commission so far, it's not incivility that people
...(unintelligible).  It can't be done in this way.  These issues
arise a lot with our public controversies or tests to create national
discourse by the President's Commission on Race, and it would be very
wise and strategic, I think, for the Commission to have the ability to
say at critical moments that `This assumption or this practice is not
only (unintelligible) or may not be as productive as you think for
these reasons.' And it seems to me that everything you've discovered
so far will lead to the tasking to be able to do that.
<p>
To give a little--a shorthand version of this, every time there's a
big controversy and people are screaming at each other and there's
sort of a major flare-up in the political culture, somebody hunts down
Deborah Tannen and asks her why this is an example of a
...(unintelligible) culture at work.  Well, in fact, you've developed
something that's richer and more interesting in many ways than one
person ...(unintelligible).  You should do the Deborah Tannen thing as
a kind of SWAT team--public discourse SWAT team response and be able
to respond in the moment to attempts at creating public discourse that
are off track or not likely to work or contain faulty assumptions and
so forth.  So that would...
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Two--two quick sort of responses to that.  One would
be (unintelligible) use of that, maybe, to solve the--the article in
the life secti--section of Sunday's Inquirer is precisely about that.
And we were saying that word of mouth--a family, for example, is
probably worried about (unintelligible).  And that is very much the
...(unintelligible) of what--what we learn from it.  Two, the--in the
programs that we are imagining in terms of citizens debates around the
elections and so forth, the kind of critique that you're mentioning is
very much explicitly something that--we would want to be part of that.
So it's not just the one-shot assumption, but it's also been the
discussion by the political experts like Matthew Morrow.  It's the
discussion by, like, Kathleen, who can talk about discourse, so that
it's filled out in a much more elaborate ...(unintelligible).  So
that's certainly--yeah.
<p>
Unidentified Man:  I'd just like to express a little concern about the
finding (unintelligible) by coming to you, but the tenor and tone of
the way in which you laid out the problems.  And my concern is that
the emphasis is exclusively on procedure.  And I'd rather not that
this Commission is primarily (unintelligible) procedure, but I think
it's wrong to leave the impression that it is procedures that--that
are solely procedures.  At least from my point of view, it's all the
procedures that got us into the problem, and that procedures can get
us out.  And there tends to be this impression that it's the press or
it's the nature of the political system or something, that
(unintelligible) the problem that come--I mean, and I--I'm quite
certain that this is not a view which is universally shared by the
Commission, but it--it seems to me that the way you present it sort of
pushes in that direction.
<p>
And the alternative is that it's--that--that we--the problems that we
face in our discourse have been created by the nat--the--the
substantive issues that the society has faced and tried to solve in
the last two--two or three--two or three decades.  And I think it's
important to recognize that--that that is a--a--that that at least has
been a factor in all of this.  And I think that the--the--the--so that
the--a mention of--there's--there's very little mention in your
presentation of substantive issues.  There's very little--when you
talk about org--civic organizations, there's very little
reference--there's no reference to the civic organizations that are
associated with those issues, particularly ethnic organizations,
churches, trade--trade unions.
<p>
And I--I guess, from my point of view, it is in part, maybe in very
large part, the nature of the issues, and not the lack of civil
organizations but the way in which the power for civic organizations
in our society became associated with particularly
difficult--difficult--with particular positions on issues that have
turned out to be particularly--particularly difficult.  And I don't
think to say that takes away at all from the notion that we can
develop procedures and approaches that have--that--that will
facilitate the way in which we deal with--with--with these--with these
issues.  But I guess I feel very strongly that universities,
museums--that these organizations are--are no substitute for somehow
incorporating back to trade unions and business and--and adversarial
business, the churches with their--and ma--and--and
...(unintelligible) organizations into this--this--this--these civic
discourses.
<p>
And--and--and I think it's important to avoid the idea that we're
going to create an alternative civic society rather than--than draw
back into the civic--civil--to a larger civic discourse the elements
for a civil society that already--that already exist.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  I--I guess all I'll comment on that is to say that,
certainly, the conversations ...(unintelligible) of discourse with the
public are--we're talking about real conversations of real issues, not
metaconversations about discourse ...(unintelligible) in place of
that, as--as Jay points out.  But we recognize that the
metaconversation that, to some extent, the Commission is quite
actively engaged in, is not the conversation; it--it's merely a way of
getting clearer about what should happen there and what kind of
engagements brought solutions to the issue.
<p>
Unidentified Woman #2:  I think in one of your transparencies there
was the expression of report card.  I'm not sure where it's reflected
here, in...
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  In the research.
<p>
Unidentified Woman #2:  ...in the research.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Yeah.
<p>
Unidentified Woman #2:  And I--I wanted to--to draw you out a little
bit more.  That--that strikes me as interesting.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Well, I...
<p>
Unidentified Woman #2:  What do you have in mind in terms of metrics
or (unintelligible) how you--because this--this--in this one little
sentence, I think this may be echo some of what Maria said
before--I--I think naturally in terms of ...(unintelligible) Amnesty.
Amnesty every year comes out with a report which really grabs the
world on how good or bad we've been with regard to civilly--our
relation to civic rights.  And if something can be developed along
these lines, that can be useful to the world and not just for internal
consumption.  And that's what I would like to hear more of from you.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  I--I think exactly what I want to say, which is that
machinisms like some kind of report card, some kind of a so--solution
for (unintelligible) would be useful as elements to develop
consciousness of the way in which we engage, and who's doing
...(unintelligible), who's doing that and so forth.  And then it
should ...(unintelligible).  I know that the Ansberg Sewell Policy
Center had developed some of those measures.  We have not really had a
chance to look at exactly how to do that, but I do (unintelligible) at
the end of the ...(unintelligible) on the 16 discourse programs that
we ...(unintelligible) that one of the ...(unintelligible) issues and
evaluation and methods of improvement and so forth, (unintelligible)
and--on a larger society ...(unintelligible).  So that is very much
the direction in which we want to go.
<p>
Unidentified Man #2:  Steve, just--just remember, we are going to be
in the situation where the operation was a success but the patient
died.  It's not about evaluating the discourse.  It's about outcomes.
Right?  And so it may be that we find an outcome that works, and the
whole process will (unintelligible).  So it's got to be very--I think
that's particularly--at least ...(unintelligible) are concerned with.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  You--you can't cover the entire community so that--to
hearken back to Michael's comment and--and pick up on the faults, we
will have to define some outcome variables here.  Will it be a certain
kind of community capacity?  Will it be more people voting who have
engaged in another aspect of this process?  Will it be reconnections
among competing civically engaged groups each of them have?  But some
outcome variables are going to be very necessary, or there will be a
process sort of turning on itself.  And I--I think the variables
clearly recognize that.
<p>
We've put a lot of ideas on the table, and--and what we will ask is
that you think about this and continue to think about other ways that
we can proceed with your input and--and with your take on what we
accomplished and what we learned over the last three years, and the
continuing thinking on your part about other ways or--or incremental
ways to enhance the next phase on the basis of your insights with
regard to what we learned certainly will be central as we move along.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  And particularly also which of these endeavors is
most important.  One of the things we've heard very clearly from many
of you was do a few things well; don't be too bold.  You know, we've
laid it out there conceptually or strategically, in a somewhat global
fashion, but we are very conscious of the fact that we need to start
but we won't achieve all of this all at once.  And--but we do think
that we have a foundation to, shall we say, move the ball down the
field ...(unintelligible).
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Well, we'd like to do a few things well, and we'd like to
begin with those that seem to have the greatest impact.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Right.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  So we--we've taken a very safe course, appropriately so,
I think, over the last three years, and I think we've convened a--a
wonderful group, and we have many interesting people.  And we've had
an extraordinary number of interesting speakers.  And from the
convening power of the Commission alone, I think that there has been a
great deal learned and--and an enormous amount of benefit.  But if we
take on the challenge of a second phase, then we really need, I
believe, to deliver important things in important ways that have the
capacity to transform and allow us to fulfill some of the goals and
aspirations that we communicated through the coordinate of the
Commission, and we intend to do that and really will benefit from your
help.
<p>
So, Steve, thank you for a very useful summary and a
...(unintelligible) of potential next steps.  We'll take about 10 or
15 minutes...
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  Ten minutes.  Yeah.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  ...and then we'll begin our next session.  Thank you.
<p>
Mr. STEINBERG:  And--and we'll be back in the--in the
...(unintelligible).
