Discussion following the Concluding Remarks of Dr. Judith Rodin
<p>
</font>
</center>
<p>

JUDITH RODIN:  So that's my mini-review.  It clearly can't capture
all of the domains in which we might work, but I've tried to capture at
least
some of the more salient ones as I saw them.  I'm happy to put any of
these
back on or to take other candidates.  I'll certainly circulate this, and
we'll
take minutes here and circulate that as well and continue from that frame.
But, Michael, if you'll help me, why don't we see if there are other
candidates or what your reactions are to what I've proposed?
<p>




ROBERT WIEBE:  I tried to do the same thing you did in a much briefer
compass. <p>

RODIN:  Will you pull the microphone...
<p>
WIEBE:  Sorry.
<p>
RODIN:  Thank you.
<p>
WIEBE:  I tried to do what you just did in much briefer compass, and
because it is brief, let me just say it, even though I'm repeating--there
is
one, the very last one I have here, that wasn't in yours, I think, and I
would like to have it included.  I thought in the two days, the discussion
broke down into these five categories:  facilitating fruitful public
discussion; developing mutual trust; widening participation in public
decisions; incorporating experts in public policy; effecting norms of
violence
in the resolution of public problems.
<p>
RODIN:  What's the last one here?
<p>
WIEBE:  The last one--the first four, in some way...
<p>
RODIN:  Yeah.
<p>
WIEBE:  And I guess my response to the question of
technique is to set aside now what we see as the outcome, because we don't
know what we've done yet, and to wait until we've done something and then
we
can talk about what might be the best uses for it and to think about how
we
might incorporate the talents and the energies around the table.  And I
would hope that you or your steering committee could do
it on a voluntary basis, initially, try to do something like you did or I
have done and say, `Would you like to volunteer to do further work in this
area to see if we couldn't make natural match-ups between things that have
been raised in these two days and where members of the committee would
like to
invest further energies?'
<p>
RODIN:  Michael, why don't you get the others, if you would, to fill
that in?
<p>
WIEBE:  Widening participation was number three.  Widening participation
in
public decisions. <p>

RODIN:  Thank you. <p>

MARTIN SELIGMAN:  I didn't try to do anything as ambitious as Judy or Bob
did.  What I've been listening for is the two questions that I
found most attractive in the last two days.  And I think I want to say
what
they are.  And they do tie in, I think, with the agenda that Judy gave us.
The first one ties in.  It's a more concrete expression of the
question of barriers to reasoned discourse.  And it comes out of what
Kathleen Jamieson was talking about a bit.  I was heartened by
Kathleen's telling us that for the substance of unreasoned dialogue, there
are
market forces that are limiting and correcting it.
<p>
But there's something else that I think underlies several of the problems
we
talked about today that the market forces are facilitating.  And it's not
the
substance of the unreasoned dialogue, but the form of it.  And that is,
I don't have a good name for it, but I'm going to talk around it a bit.
It's
something like the culture of immediacy, that I think there is a cultural
problem which we now all accept because it's so familiar--a culture of the
sound bite; a culture of immediacy; a culture of present-mindedness, of
short-termism.  Some people have called it...
<p>
RODIN:  Winner-takes-all, which I think is part of it, too.
<p>
SELIGMAN:  Some people call it the dumbing down of America and 
it's supported by the marketplace, and it undercuts
reflectiveness and complexity and long-termism.  And because Calvin
Trillin is
here and in line with one of the things he said, I think this is the
McDonald's of the mind.  This is the fast food of the minds.  And I think
we
should be trying to promote an ...(unintelligible) of the mind.
<p>
RODIN:  The what?
<p>
SELIGMAN:  So that's one topic, the culture of immediacy, that I think we
can do
something about.
<p>
And the other question I found most attractive, which I think is a
subclass of
the leadership question, is something that both Bob Wiebe and
Derek Bok asked about, which I'm greatly puzzled about.  When I ask
myself, `Why are we really concerned about incivility?' I think the reason
we're concerned is that the agenda of many of us is we want to revive
faith in our institutions, and the incivility has undermined it, and Derek
asked the question, and Bob tried to answer it:  `Why is it that faith in
our
institutions didn't revive after 1973?'  What's kept it going for the last
25
years?  What's happened?
<p>
And I think this is very complicated.  Both Derek and Bob and Paul
talked about Vietnam and other factors and the like.  There's one more
factor
that goes along with it that puzzles me, and that's that there's been a
tenfold increase in mental depression.  During that period, particularly
in
our young people--and it's not an artifact of asking the question.  If you
ask
people, `Was there ever a time in your life in which you cried every day
for
two weeks?' There's 10 times as much of that now as there used to be, in a
society of unprecedented wealth and power.  There's more pessimism and
more
depression.  And so the question that attracts me about this is to try to
unravel this complex question of the decline in leadership, the erosion of
the
faith in institution and how it's related to these other trends that have
happened in our society in the last 40 years. <p>

JOYCE APPLEBY :  I think that we could be a catalyst in a reactive
process that's going on right now.  And that process is, I think, the
despair
and discouragement and disgust at the overweening influence of the market
mores in public life.  I think that the market relies upon competition,
it incites competition, it clearly individualizes people in working with
them
directly.  It uncouples responsibility from power and, of course, it gives
power to money, but it's also an impersonal process, and I think this
sense of
impersonal processes being the determining forces in our society
contributes to the despair, maybe even to the depression.
<p>
But there's another thing that has made the market more powerful in
the last 10 or 20 years.  It's sort of interesting that we spent two days
together and no one has said the word `postmodernism,' but in a way we're
kind
of having modernist answers to a postmodernist problem, and that is that
entertainment is now the principal shaper of values in our society.
<p>
RODIN:  That's right.
<p>
APPLEBY:  And the entertainment industry, of course, is totally dominated
by
the market.  But there are other aspects of the predominance of
entertainment that we might consider, and that's the way in which the
entertainment as this pervasive cultural form in delivering the substance
to
our culture--what does entertainment do?  Well, it turns the public
into an audience.  I think we all see ourselves as consumers of
entertainment and we're critics of entertainment.  I think we've
we've talked indirectly about the way in which politics has become a form
of entertainment and the press reports it as entertainment.  Yesterday we
talked about the way in which private lives became grist for an
entertainment
mill and how we felt disturbed about that.
<p>
But also I think that this entertainment also creates this world of
celebrities and envy and it distances people and so one of the things we
might consider is how we could conceive of a public space that wasn't
dominated by entertainment values and market mores.  And maybe one of the
things we could do, through some vehicle, would just be make people more
aware
of the way in which the market shapes values in our society.  And we're
aware
of the market and its pernicious influence, but I don't think that we have
quite as full and powerful a vocabulary of analysis of the market.
<p>
THOMAS BENDER:  Skip substance for a moment, because I think I agree
with some of the substantive points, including Joyce's
most stated one.  But I'm trying to think of an activity
that might wrap some of these things up--Bob's list, plus Joyce's
and other partial comments.  And it strikes me--this may be really
naive, but this is initiated by a university president--I
think of a kind of setting--this kind of space Joyce is talking
about--being somewhat like Jim Fishkin's space, and whether or not one of
the
things this commission ought to try and imagine is a role for universities
in
our society.
<p>
We are supposed to be a special kind of space.  We're becoming less and
less a
special kind of place, but maybe we can reassert that we're a special kind
of
place, but not a place where all kinds of self-enclosed disciplines exist;
that we can be ambidextrous.  We can do that kind of thing, as we all do,
but
we could also open out, literally, to local communities.  And all of the
benefits that we're talking about and all of the problems we're talking
about
seems to me can be located right there through--obviously, the question of
expertise and leadership and democracy are all there.
<p>
I mean, this is my own hobby.  Of course, the experts are going to have to
get
in the same pool as the other folks in this model, but it also does this
empowerment; that is, you don't have to be a passive audience in an
entertainment society.  Then I think that all of the question of people
actively being together, doing some work and, you know, cumulatively,
there
are a lot of campuses--every town in this
country of any size has a significant university campus these days.  It
might be too much to imagine them all going into action.
<p>
But nonetheless, we do have a graph and we may have some models which have
to
do with putting people, beginning on the first day with Lani's classroom
and
ending today with your work and the drama and the
deliberative polling, it seems to me that we have a rough notion of what
some
of the issues are.  The real question is, we can have an imaginative and
appropriate, given the generation of this thing--a kind of place to do
it. <p>

RODIN:  I was asked by the press when they knew of this why I was
doing it; you know, had something terrible happened on campus.  They
were looking for a hook.  And I said no, that actually, I believed that
universities were a setting in society that had given up the role of
informing, of having hard conversations and of working with the broader
public to grapple with really pressing social issues, and that there were
lots
of pressures on universities not to want to do that, but some universities
had
to step up and take a leadership role here as one channel of society
for opening out and engaging our various communities in these sets
of issues.  Neil, you were next, then Paul.  Go ahead. <p>

NEIL SMELSER:  Would you put up your second sheet?
<p>
RODIN:  Right.  Mm-hmm.
<p>
<center>
<img src=ques2.gif alt="">
</center>
<p>
SMELSER:  I'll make a cautionary comment and then a recommendation.  Yes,
what
I would like to caution against is assuming a Cassandralike attitude
toward
that "how do we arrest the decline of civic life?"  I mean, that
that sort of says, 'Putnam is right,' and that is a very complex
debate going on now about.  So I guess the question [is] of not prejudging
so much.
It's very tempting, if we're interested in improving this quality of life,
to assert that it's going down the tubes.  And I just don't think we ought
to
fall into that trap. <p>

Second is I would like to, without having specific agenda, make sure we
don't ignore what you might call the macro side of the forces affecting
community life in this society.  I'm talking about the economy.  I'm
talking
about changes in the legal system.  I'm talking about changes in migration
and
group life and changes in government policies.  These are things that we
began
talking about in the next-to-the-last session.  And I just hope we don't
lose
sight because that will help us, I think, think in a more complex and less
absolute way about the matter.
<p>
RODIN:  I think that's important.  In the next-to-the-last session we
dealt with, in a peripheral way, not only the macro issues, but what we on
the
Steering Committee were calling `the hot-button issues' in our society:
immigration, affirmative action, abortion.  And another cut at this might
be
to take a session and really try to understand why certain issues are
hot-button issues in our society, and then look at the multiple levels,
including the macro issues, that really relate to that.  And we had
hoped in a next meeting, among other things, that we might take that look.
<p>
PAUL VERKUIL:  Let's continue this approach.  I think the idea of bringing
the
university in in a very self-conscious way makes an awful lot of sense,
because it is a major institution whose purpose is ultimately to create
and
listen to and have voices heard.  But there are other institutions that,
as you say, can help to subvert boundaries that we ought to look at.  And
I've
been trying to think about them as we sat here today.  And after our
session this afternoon with these wonderful examples of people who
actually do things to create voices and to break down boundaries,
maybe we should add some more.  So here are some of the ideas, and they
might
also lead us to want to add some people to this commission.
<p>
For example, who's already community building, the military? One of the
most successful communities that we have --whatever else you can say about
it-- it may be an
undemocratic institution, but it works.  It's got the highest poll ratings
these days and more than that, it's integrated and it has succeeded in
many respects, although it has problems of dealing with some of the issues
that we don't like to face.  So that's one.  AmeriCorps grows out of
that--things that are going on in Washington without the military.
<p>
The census, you know, every 10 years we spend millions of dollars to
collect data about Americans, and that's a process that is a face-to-face
process.  If you know how it's done, it's very much of a community
process.
People go around.  We ought to learn more about the census--how it works,
how
we could maybe plug into it.  The Supreme Court recently issued an opinion
that took away from the states--the states all sued because they based
their, you know, welfare payments on the number of citizens or the number
of
people who are counted in there and so forth, and they've left it more to
the
discretion of the Department of Commerce.  We might want to
learn about how the census works and how that might be used.
<p>
Juries.  One of the greatest existing community units we have is
the jury system, which comes together for a specific purpose.
But can you do something with a jury pool while it's sitting there?
It [is]a randomly selected group of citizens and they are
available in a variety of contexts.  Do we want to include them?
<p>
And I just looked at other things.  What's the biggest group we know of in
athletics, maybe Little Leagues?  What happens?  Richard Lapchick
knows about athletics; maybe you know about leagues and things.  But
people do
get together in communities for athletic purposes a whole lot.
<p>
And, finally, Social Security is being reformed.  I know we don't want to
reform Social Security here.  But we did talk about the dialogue that goes
on
in Medicare and health care.  And in the recent evaluation of
Social Security, there is contention about whether or not to
privatize, as you probably know.  [A] defense of not privatizing Social
Security is that it's a community commitment and that we ought not [end
it.]  And now
what does that mean?  You know, so maybe we want to learn more about this.
[It] goes to this business of the market that Joyce talked about.  I don't
know
whether the market is a better solution to Social Se[curity], to
retirement or not.
And what is the value of a Social Security commitment or a
health-care commitment? <p>

And, finally, what about the Internet?  Does that play into all this
community
business?  I don't know, either.
<p>
RODIN:  It seems to me we have to look at the Internet at some point.
Claude. <p>

CLAUDE STEELE:  Yeah.  This is in the interest of adding something to the
list
that we haven't talked, at least directly, about.  I suppose a number of
people have alluded to it.  But one might think of the issue of
civility, civic public life, as having two dimensions to it.
<p>
One is the civility of public discourse, which we have attended to a great
deal.  And the other is the concept of civic commitment or the
other side of the meaning of the term 'civic life'
of having a sense of responsibility for other people, for
inequalities in society and that sort of side of it.  In fact, in
public discourse, I think the term 'civic' often has that meaning to it.
It refers to more than discourse; it refers to a sort of
an expanded sense of responsibility for the commons.  Do we
encourage the value of taking care of the commons? <p>

And so I think a commission like this is a good place to address
that kind of concerns, because there are structural factors that undermine
the commons and undermine our sense of responsibility about taking
care of it.  The increasing inequality of income, the
abandonment of responsibility for our public school system, for the
nature of inner cities, the new welfare bill.
<p>
There are a variety of things that have structural impacts that I think
underlie inequalities that then in turn underlie the incivility of
public discourse to some degree.  So I think both kinds of
of civility are on decline, both the civility of the
discourse that we have and also the sense of
responsibility we have to each other and to the commons in general.
So I feel that this is going to be a good arena for--my hope is for
addressing that side of it as well.
<p>
RODIN:  Go ahead.
<p>
ANDRAS SAJO:  I do some comparative constitutional law, and it is
more and more called an intellectual exercise in identifying intellectual
blind spots.  And I think that it is inevitable that--and I suppose
we were invited to remind people that you don't live in
a closed world.  And I think it would be very important to bring in a
global or external dimension.  We [have] seen in some of the presentations
the impact of the Cold War.  There is something out there which has an
impact
on the US.  And in practical terms, perhaps it would be quite interesting
and challenging, maybe for this commission, maybe for another audience,
to have a replica of this in Europe, in the Middle East, somewhere else.
Just ask your own questions from those people there and see what
is the reaction.
<p>
And there's just one point that came up to my mind, although to some
extent it was mentioned in the form of the Army, etc.  In these two
days it was fascinating to listen that there is leadership, there is
community.  What is in between?  It was only one institution:  the media.
And
this is something very, very, very strange.  If you come from Europe,
where you have all these institutionalized, mediating, intermediate
organizations, from quite disgusting, now corporatists institutions to
trade unions or many other organizations, which act
as go-betweens between these two spheres.
<p>
So I think that's something--if it doesn't exist in the US,
that's certainly very interesting, but I don't think that this is the
case.
It does exist here, and in that case we really have to conceptualize.
It's
not simply a macro problem.
<p>
RODIN:  Jay, you were next.
<p>
JAY ROSEN:  A few quick questions and then one challenge to us in the
commission.
Some of the questions I think we should definitely keep our eye on are,
first
of all, the possibilities of a civic professionalism.  I think we need to
talk more about all the professions and the ways in which those
professions,
those professional organizations, the leaders of those professions, could
be
recruited into the general cause that the commission is pursuing, for the
simple reason that those are major non-market forces in the culture.
And we need to think about how we include professionals, professionalism,
and
what Tom Bender and others have written about as civic professionalism in
our
work.
<p>
Secondly, I think we need to think much more about incidents like the ones
that Kathleen illustrated, when, for some combination of factors,
incivility
was somehow inhibited or shamed or shamed out of existence.  That seemed
to me
to be part of what she told us about when she discussed how these ads were
withdrawn.  So if we can find other cases where uncivil or regrettable
behavior was somehow inhibited, this would tell us a lot about what we're
trying to do.
<p>
Third, I think it's extremely important that we think imaginatively and
creatively about where are the intervening points, the viable entry
points,
for the sort of thing the commission might make?  All over this country
people
meet in various kinds of public and professional spaces.  We ought to
think of
what we're doing as having a destination, not only an audience in
particular groups of people, but destinations almost in a sense of
physical spaces.  I mean, I think of all the Sheratons and Marriotts
meeting
rooms around the country where every day in this country a huge array of
organizations get together and meet, and they are engaging in the
reproduction
of civic life.  Everything you see on C-SPAN is an example of that.  We
ought to think about what could we possibly make for those destinations
that
would somehow intervene in what happens there and possibly alter it.  Now
those are my three quick points. <p>

My challenge is this:  To go back to Tom Bender's remarks about the
university, I think he's absolutely right.  And I think you are right that
the
university has a special responsibility here.  I think we should think
harder
about making ourselves--this commission--in fact, this room, this physical
space, as an arena where we demonstrate an experiment with extraordinary
acts
of civility that others might find instructive.  This space is, itself,
extraordinary if you just look around it.
<p>
I mean, just look first of all, [at] the physical beauty of it, the way in
which it recalls the origins of the republic with the classical
architecture;
the fact that we have natural light; more importantly, the video cameras
that are here.  We're making television here.  We just so happen to be
making
very bad television.  And the sound recordings--the fact that this is
being recorded--it will become a text and that text will go on the
Internet--we ought to think about something that we could do in this room,
perhaps of a civically theatrical nature, which would demonstrate to
everybody that something new is possible.  And I think this would help us
address one of the problems that these kinds of commissions have.  And I
think
you've already thought about this.  One of the weaknesses of commissions
of
this type is that they issue recommendations, right?  And the reply to a
commission's recommendations is always 
vulnerable to the following reply, which is, `It's easy for you to say,'
right? <p>

So what we ought to try to think about coming up with something that is
not easy for us to say, that, in fact, was hard won for us to say because
we
did something among ourselves that was really hard to do.  And we did it
and
we learned it and we learned from it, and what we can say to other people
when
we are done is, `You can do it, too.'  And the `you' could be a lot of
different groups--all those groups that meet in all the Marriotts and
Sheratons around the world.  So I think we should think very imaginatively
about something that could happen here that would demonstrate some new
possibilities for civic dialogue, because 99 percent of the things that we
could do are uninvented.
<p>
RODIN:  Jim. <p>


JAMES FISHKIN:  Yeah.  I just have a simple procedural recommendation.  I
think that we should try to make this commission a functioning
deliberative
body.  And by that I mean--I think you are transcribing all of these
discussions of the weekend, right?  I would recommend, first, as I think
you're planning, that the transcription be sent as soon as possible to
everybody; secondly, that perhaps there be a list serve, because probably
everybody here is on e-mail, and if there are one or two who
aren't, they have access to have a fax machine, and so the essential
equivalent could be made by somebody at the commission faxing the
non-e-mail
person or persons the materials.
<p>
But I think we should try to arrange for a continuing dialogue between
now and the time this commission meets the next time.  And the first task
we
should all think about undertaking is reflecting over the weekend, perhaps
with the help of the transcript and of our memories and notes, and
thinking
about trying to distill [the] framing of the topic which survives
reflection.
<p>
There's a lot of material.  Some of the things said here were
absolutely brilliant and a few of them, I think, were silly.  But
we each probably have our own version of that, but those things that
survive reflection with an aim to making recommendations to your Steering
Committee about topics that need to be included in the agenda for next
time,
with an aim to possible end results, but not necessarily, because it may
be
too early for that.  And I would also ask you to think about possibly
some portion of the weekend or the event next time being divided into
smaller group discussions, where the groups could be manageable enough
that
you could really talk for an hour or two, and with some product to come
out of
it to be presented to the larger group, because real deliberation
works well in a smaller group than this.  And some interaction
between the smaller groups and the larger groups would be
useful.
<p>
So those are purely procedural recommendations, but it would be great if
we
could have a continuing dialogue over the period of time.  We've all
been sort of activated and we need to not lose the fruits of that, but to
carry it forward for next time.
<p>
RODIN:  And there are several other members who just had crazy scheduling
conflicts or who at the last minute--a couple illnesses of people who
were really very desperate to be here and participate.  So we need to get
them
up to where we are, as well, and using  a list serve, I think, is
a way to engage them fairly quickly.  Rochelle.
<p>
ROCHELLE GURSTEIN:  This isn't really a recommendation.  I just wanted to
point out
maybe a month ago there was a big teach-in at Columbia, that I don't know
if
anyone's aware of, of labor and intellectuals.  John Sweeney was there
and labor unions, in general, were there.  And there was a very big
response.  There was, at least, I think, 1,500 or 2,000 people the first
day.
They broke down into small groups.  There were a lot of
students who were there, also.  I don't know how the students fit into
this,
but it really was impressive to see how many people from labor unions came
and spoke in these smaller groups.
<p>
We haven't talked about labor at all today.  I mean, labor
unions--probably
because labor unions don't have much power anymore and we don't think
about
them.  But one of the things that we keep talking about is this kind of
attitude of we're all consumers of news media and so on.  Part of that, of
course, is a response to having a society that's so split between what
had once been a productive laboring society, historians say, of the 19th
century and now the culture of consumption of the 20th century.  We
haven't
talked about the division and degradation of labor that maybe has helped
to
lead to a lack of participation in politics, since there's very few
opportunities in everyday life to participate in anything.  So maybe
that's
something that we need to add to this discussion which, so far, we haven't
talked about.
<p>
RODIN:  Lani, you're next. <p>

LANI GUINIER:  I just wanted to echo what I heard from Tom Bender
both yesterday and today, and to try to bring what he said together with
some
of the really important work that Mari Fitzduff is doing in Northern
Ireland
and also some of the observations that I heard Joyce make about trying
to conceive of a public space that's not dominated by either the market or
entertainment.  And it really does seem that the university is not only
such a
potential space, but it's a space that we all have in common, not only
because
we're here meeting at a university, but my sense--and I don't know
everyone's
biography, but my sense is that we're all connected to a university in
some
way. <p>

And the challenge--and here I think Jay is absolutely right--that this is
a
challenge to be creative and experimental and that it's not just a
challenge
for us to be experimental within the sight of this commission.  But going
back
to your comment yesterday, the challenge is to take this problem back to
our
own classrooms and back to our own universities and not just talk about it
among ourselves, but to try to invite other people into this conversation
and to explore ways of thinking and doing that could be very creative
and innovative. <p>

And the reason that I feel it's important to underscore this is because
I'm a
little worried that the focus for some people on this commission--and this
is
not to say that we all have to agree on what the focus for the commission
is--but I do worry that some people seem more concerned about incivility
and
others seem more concerned about community.  And I see incivility as a
symptom of dysfunction, and incivility in many ways is the symptom of the
lack
of community.  But I don't think that the solution is to simply impose or
to
articulate some desired vision of community, because--this is where I
thought
Mari's comments were so important--that we really have to talk about
sustainable community.
<p>
And so it was ironic that--in terms of the Cornerstone Theater, that June
30th
becomes this embodiment of community, which--on some level it does reflect
a
momentary or temporary or transient community, and certainly the
role of the theater and the role of innovative ways of communicating and
the
role of the spectacle is important in terms of inviting people to come
together for a moment to become a community so that they at least know
what
that feels like.  Where it's such an odd feeling for so many people that,
yes, celebrating June 30th, a birthday in common, is an important
milestone. <p>

But, to me, the reason I think it's important to come back to the notion
of
the university and the idea of community is that, at least for most of
the people at the university, they're here for four years.  They may not
be
here for their lifetime, but they're here for four years.  You bring
people
from very different backgrounds and it's an opportunity to rethink the
role of
the university in this society and to try to reconnect the university to
its
public mission, not just to the education of individual students, not just
as
a place where we are passing through, but really as a sustainable
community.
<p>
And this is where I want to come back to Tom's comments from
yesterday.  He said in closing that, `We are not a public unless we have
work
to do.' And this is a little paraphrase of what he said, `And in a way,
we're
not a community unless we have work to do together.' And so, to me, 
if we're going to reconceptualize not only the university as this
important intermediate public space, but also as an example of a
sustainable
community, the challenge is to think of the university as a public that
has
work to do, not just the individual work of the individuals who come here,
but
as a community that is going to do some kind of work together.
And this, again, brings me to the last point, which is Mari's, that it's
not
just to be a public, it's not just to be a community, it's not just to be
a
sustainable community, but we also have to be a diverse community; that
is, we
have to be a community that can come together with diverse experiences and
diverse expectations and, therefore, we have to give people a sense of
belonging to this community that they care about so that they don't
retreat
into their prior, exclusive identities, or that, nine months after they
leave
the deliberative poll, you see the regression effect taking place.
<p>
And I thought the comments of Neil about the stranger effect, the odyssey
effect and the Hawthorne effect all feel special.  They can think that
this has
a beginning and an end and, therefore, it's easier for them to experiment
with
changing themselves because, in fact, if they don't like it, they can go
back
to whoever they were when they leave.  But because of alumni associations,
because of the professional associations that all emanate from the
university,
there is a chance not just to change the nature of what the university
does
when people are there, but also to give them a sense of belonging for the
rest
of their lives to this ongoing sustainable and diverse community.
<p>
RODIN:  Thank you.  Michael, you're next.
<p>
MICHAEL PIORE:  I'd like to just make another plug for the hot-button
issues. 
And I know that's been mentioned.  But I think they're much more central
to
the discussion than the amount of time we've spent on them because I think 
they raise at least two related themes. <p>

One is the theme which was discussed in the first session, but
we sort of lost it afterwards--is how much the difficulties we have in
civility [in] forming a community are the result of new voices which
have emerged, which raises the question as
to whether community couldn't be restored by pushing those voices back 
or curtailing these voices.  And a
lot of those voices--maybe not all of them, but I see them as connected to
these hot-button substantive issues.  And, at least for me, a very
important part of the need for community is to resolve those issues.
<p>
And so the question of [how]communities form or people come
together in community when they have work to do--I see those issues myself
as the work that we need community for and so on.  But I don't know that
that is really universally accepted.  And so I think we
need to discuss those issues, those hot-button issues, not so much in
themselves, because each one of them, in a sense, is discussed
in itself, but in relationship to this issue of process or community. <p>

EDNA ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  Just two points, very quickly.  One is I'd like
still to make a pitch or to urge to include this topic of boundaries of
the
community--inclusion, exclusion, membership--as a focal point to some of
of the issues that were raised.
<p>
And then the other point is that I would very much like to urge the
members of
this commission or maybe the Steering Committee to think how to exploit or
use
us, the three people who are non-Americans, because I don't
think we should be an exotic specimen or speciwomen, you know, adorning
this
or just bringing anecdotal experiences from faraway places.  I think there
is
a possible real contribution that we can be
used as resource people, of bringing some kind of perspective to make it
less US-central or focused, not in the sense that we have to solve the
problems of the globe, but that there are some issues that were discussed
here
that even just comparisons would help, and some of the problems that
plague
America are problems that are going to plague the rest of the world.
There is
an import and export of problems and issues going on, so that can be used.
But I'm not quite sure I have the answer of how I want or can be used.  I
have
a few ideas, which are still half-baked, but I would just urge you wise
people
to think how to do that.  Thank you. <p>

MARI FITZDUFF:  All right.  Just a suggestion that might help in our
discussion is I would appreciate some sort of a trend analysis by the
equivalent of the serious Alvin Toeffler's about the realities that are
facing
us.  Economics are about to define our wealth and our society.  I mean,
the
whole question of Far Eastern development of economics, etc.--the whole
question of free trade is under a lot of controversy at the moment.
<p>
All of these trends we need to know about because they're actually, even
within the three years that the commission is going to be in existence--be
defining and redefining our lives.  And I would appreciate if we could get
what is the best available to undertake something like that for us.
<p>
RODIN:  Are there other data that you would like or other
background papers that you think we should commission?
<p>
FISHKIN:  All data that was referred to about where
the decline for institutions it's sufficiently
complex and interesting.  But the trend since--that book data from
1962-- we're going to see that data.
<p>
RODIN:  Yes.
<p>
FISHKIN:  But that wouldn't be hard.  There'd be a lot of data like that.
But respect for a variety of institutions the media, the Army, the public
officials, etc., I think, would be very useful.
<p>
DREW FAUST: I'd like to see something that's a little more
qualitative and relates to what Edna was saying; also relates to one of
the
ways you framed the questions on the second chart, where you talked about
returning the private to the private.  I can't remember exactly what it
said, but I think it was
kind of the embodiment of David's horror at how do we re-establish the
boundary between the public and private?  I think the United States has a
very
particular notion of what `civic' and what `public' are, and that it's
quite
different from European nations.  When you go to France--having taken my
teen-age daughter to France, she just couldn't believe the public life
that
was taken for granted in Paris.  And she found it such a contrast to urban
life in the United States, and just the naive eyes of the innocent brought
it
to me very clearly.
<p>
And I think it'd be very interesting for us to have some kind of
qualitative
evaluation of how we draw these lines, because it's not so much a matter
of
just shoving the private back behind closed doors, but I think it relates
to
what Claude said, which is the notion of:  What do we define as public
responsibility and, therefore, how do we build a civic culture in which we
agree upon certain kinds of shared responsibilities and experiences?  And
I
think that it would be useful to have some kinds of sense of how
those values are articulated and executed in public life and its
definition in
other cultures and societies.
<p>
RODIN:  All right.
<p>
ROSEN:  I'd like to have a survey of exercises
in civic imagination, along the lines Mari's testified to, innovative
things that have been done around the country and around the world that
are
extraordinary for their potential and promise, that people have invented
and
carried out, like the community theater thing that we heard about, that
could
be described in a page or a couple of paragraphs that would give us a
diverse
and rich store of examples to think about around the country.  What's
known
about how people have creatively intervened to improve civic dialogue in
various settings.  And a lot is known; in areas like conflict mediation,
for example, there's a tremendous amount being done around the world in
places
as difficult as South Africa and Northern Ireland and so forth.  There's a
lot
being done there.  But there's just a lot known.
<p>
So the most imaginative, most thought-provoking examples of civic
imagination
at work that we could have described for us in brief detail, on a page or
two,
would be a tremendous resource for me in thinking about the work of the
commission.
<p>
RODIN:  You know, one of the things that was exciting to me in
learning about Bill's work and the Cornerstone Theater was my own
thinking about this was so cognitive, so left-brain.  It was about talking
and
ideas and creative intellection.  And these are issues that are
visceral and emotional and value-laden; they're right-brain issues.  And
so
there are a lot of right-brain solutions, I think, and creative...
<p>
ROSEN:  Right. <p>

RODIN:  ...approaches to this that at least someone like me doesn't know
as
readily and doesn't come to as easily.  And I'd like to know more about
that
kind because I think that that may get more at some of the heart of the
problem without words, initially, or with different kinds of words.
<p>
LEONARD ERON:  I don't know if it's out of place for me to say something,
because I'm
not a member of your commission, just a presenter.  But I would like to
comment on a remark you made earlier and which was brought up more
recently,
and that is the need for data.  We have heard many, many brilliant
hypotheses
here about the causes of this, about solutions.  But I haven't heard much
data.  And until we get the data, these are only hypotheses.  And I
believe
before your commission makes any recommendations, these recommendations
must
be supported by data if they're going to have any effect.
<p>
RODIN:  Good.  Thank you.  Derek.
<p>
BOK:  I was just going to say, apropos of what Jay just
mentioned, I'd not only like to know examples of creative community
building
and problem solving--that would be useful--but there has been an enormous
growth in this in recent years in an attempt to get more people involved,
more people empowered, overcome cynicism, accomplish what Jim talks about
in
his very successful effort.  But some of these have just not worked at all
I
mean, efforts to get tenants to--in public housing projects to become
active
participants in the management.  You know, three or four successes; a
great
many failures.
<p>
There are other examples in trying to solve environmental problems,
instead of
by command-and-control regulation, by community mediation or by negotiated
rule-making.  Again, some successes; some failures.  There must be some
body
of research that is trying to develop some hypotheses under what
conditions do these efforts at inclusive problem solving work?  And in
what
cases do they not work?  And that seems so central to our discussion, that
if
there were some way of pulling together that research and saying, `How
much do
we'--gets a little at your point of data--`How much'--because it should be
built on real experimentation and real analysis of actual examples and
trying to draw hypotheses from that.  `How much do we already know that we
could incorporate in our discussion so that we don't start talking about
examples of this at random and try and reinvent a wheel that has
already been worked on to successfully by others?'
<p>
RODIN:  Good.
<p>
MARTIN MARTY:  One of the things that occurs to me that could be
useful would be to run down your computer and find all of the groups right
now
that are working on civil society.  Last week the Pew Charitable Trust
announced that Sam Nunn, William Galston and--if you can believe it--Bill
Bennett are going to work on civility.  That's going to be a high-powered
thing.  It'll be a parallel track.  Jean Bethke-Elshtain, who couldn't be
here
today, has one on the mediating structures.  She's doing family,
neighborhood,
church. Several people said mediating.  Mark Silk has
one up at Hartford.  These are all coming up a little later than this one,
and
this, I think, this is the highest powered of them all.
<p>
But I'd hate to think that seven, eight, 10, 12 of these things would spin
wheels and come up with parallel-track things, when there are so many--in
other words, if Elshtain�s thing really does mediating structures, that
may
not be something we need to do. <p>

RODIN:  Right.  Exactly.
<p>
MARTY:  Bender's suggestion on [the] university might be a good one.
Bennett and
Nunn and Galston might do the political order in a very distinctive way.
Then
we don't have to do that.  And maybe out of these
eight, 10, 12--through some coordination, we might make a bigger impact,
too.
<p>
I'm impressed by your staff, and a few tickets to some of these other
places
could be useful for them to interview, to combine, and maybe at our next
meeting invite the heads of seven, eight, 10 of them here.
<p>
RODIN:  I think that's very important.  I talked to Rebecca Rimel this
week, who's the head of Pew, and agreed that we would have Steve and
Galston meet, at least, because it sounded like there was some potential
overlap, and we really wanted creative and not uncreative redundancy in
places where we would really differentiate.  And I think that that would
be
important in several of these other initiatives as well.  And we will
surely
do that.  Joyce.
<p>
APPLEBY:  Who is funding the commission?
<p>
RODIN:  It's a group of donors that's interested in these questions and
wishes, at the moment, to not be known, other than to say that they want
us to
continue to do interesting work and have important conversations and
hopefully
make a difference. <p>

KATHLEEN JAMIESON:  Good donors?
<p>
RODIN:  Good donors.  And don't want recognition--the best kinds of
donors.
<p>
Let me say, in conclusion, that this has been a wonderful two days,
getting
to know so many of you whom I didn't know, and we had read your work and
tried to understand some of what you did and thought about before
bringing you together.  But you've exceeded my greatest expectations, and
I'm
very, very grateful.  I'm grateful to the staff for all the hard work,
too.
And you've really done a great job in putting this together.
<p>
We will get transcripts to you.  I think that Jim's comment is quite
accurate
that some of this was really profound and other ideas won't stand the test
of time with regard to future initiatives and greater purposeful action on
the
part of the commission.  But for all of the great good work that you've
done
over this day and a half, you have my thanks.  And I think Jay Rosen
talked
about the importance of setting.  We didn't choose this room by accident,
and
we really did think about important spaces.  And when Philadelphia
really is chosen as the venue, one has to think about the birthplace of
our
democracy.  And our forebears really came together in committees of
correspondence, and they thought about and grappled with the difficult
issues
that our nation was about to confront as it became a nation.
<p>
And I do like to think that what we're about to embark on is becoming
several
committees of correspondence to grapple with these issues and to
move our nation, and hopefully other nations, forward to a more reasoned
and
more successful future.  Thank you. <p>
