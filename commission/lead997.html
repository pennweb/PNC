Subject:      Re: leadership: an example

Hello, folks.

Just to get ourselves going again on the leadership question, here's
something I've written for my forthcoming book on public journalism that
offers an example of what we might call "discourse leadership," the kind
our group might focus on as we think over Michael Schudson's last message
to us in the summer.  I offer it just to jog your minds a bit.  I
apologize for the length; but it's a story and stories need space to
unwind. 

Civic Imagination and the Campaign Press:
The Minnesota Compact.

        It is election season, and you are watching the evening news.  The
program breaks for commercials, which at this time of year means campaign
advertisements, often appearing one after the other.  An unflattering
photo of someone's opponent shows on screen, and an unseen announcer
begins his litany of charges.  The voice is dark, accustatory, slightly
menacing in tone.  It wants to persuade you that the candidate in question
is not only unfit but unsavory, not only a poor leader but a bad person. 
Should this dubious character somehow squeeze into office, another
scoundrel will gain power, and your own powerlessness will deepen.  The
prevailing mood of the ad is fear and, beneath the fear, a contempt for
the hapless pol who is under attack.  For attack is the only way to deal
with someone so dangerous, so cunning, and so wrong-headed. 

        In Dirty Politics, Kathleen Hall Jamieson describes one of the
most famous ads of this type, the "Willie Horton" spot produced on behalf
of George Bush's campaign in 1988.  It sought to link Bush's opponent,
Michael Dukakis, to a convicted murder who had raped a woman while on
furlough from a Massachusetts prison. 
        The ad opens with side-by-side pictures of Dukakis and Bush. 
Dukakis's hair in unkempt, the photo dark.  Bush, by contrast, is smiling
and bathed in light.  As the pictures appear, an announcer says, "Bush and
Dukakis on Crime."  A picture of Bush flashes on screen.  "Bush supports
the death penalty for murderers."  A picture of Dukakis.  "Dukakis not
only opposes the death penalty, he allowed first-degree murderers to have
weekend passes from prison."  A close-up of mug shot of Willie Horton
flashes onto the screen.  "One was Willie Horton, who murdered a boy in a
robbery, stabbing him nineteen times."  A blurry black-and-white photo of
Horton apparently being arrested appears.  "Despite a life sentence,
Horton received ten weekend passes from prison."  The words, "kidnapping," 
"stabbing" and "raping" appear on screen with Horton's picture as the
announcer adds, "Horton fled, kidnapping a young couple, stabbing the man
and repeatdely raping his girlfriend."  The final photo again shows
Michael Dukakis.  The announcer notes: "Weekend passes.  Dukakis on
crime." [end of Jamieson quote]
        Much has been written about such advertising: whether it works,
what it does to an already cynical electorate, when it is proper and when
it crosses the line into "dirty" politics.  Campaign journalists,
responding to the rising influence of the ads, invented around 1990 a
method for dealing with them: the so-called "truth" boxes that evaluated
the claims in the spot.  The idea was to provide a counter-balance to the
frequent distortion of an opponent's record. [Jamieson, 156] But as every
campaign professional knew, much of the force in such advertising came
from the potent mix of visuals and vocals, along with the emotions they
aroused.  False or misleading claims were common enough; and the press
could try to counter them with verifiable facts.  But what sort of fact
could contend with the striking juxtaposition of a white candidate and the
black rapist he supposedly set free? 
        Along with the truth boxes, the political press invented another
kind of commentary, the analysis of the "strategy" behind the ads, their
supposed appeal to this voter or that.  This fit well within a larger
narrative: the "horse race" metaphor through which the press tried to make
sense of the campaign as a series of clever (or disastrous) moves by
candidates who were rising or falling in the polls.  But as Jamieson
notes, the strategy device made for a disabling picture, in which
"candidates are seen as performers, reporters as theatre critics, the
audience as spectators."  With its emphasis on winning and losing,
performing and posing, the strategy lens invited citizens to assume a
"cynical and detached" position, from which they might observe politicians
manuevering for their votes. [p. 166-7]
        Here, journalism wound up reinforcing the deepest message of the
ads: politics was a spectacle of deceit and deception, best left to
professionals who knew the game and played it well.  It was "dirty"
business, or, at best, an art form practiced upon us by skilled hands
making savvy moves.  Striving to be equally savvy, journalists who thought
to decode the spectacle rarely thought about alternatives to it.  All of
which left citizens stranded in their living rooms, watching the politics
of mutual destruction play out before them in ad after ad.
        Tom Hamburger was Washington bureau chief of the Star Tribune in
Minneapolis in 1996.  He had written his share of strategy stories.  But
he became alarmed when the 1994 elections brought to his state the same
"attack"-style ads that were eviscerating campaign dialogue elsewhere in
the country.  He noted, as well, that in 1994 Minnesota had a record low
voter turnout for a mid-term election. 
        Blessed with a strong civic culture, Minnesotans had come to
expect a more reasoned tone to prevail in their politics.  As Hamburger
discussed the drift of things with players in both parties, he found a
near unanimous sense that the new rules ("destroy your opponent and do it
early") were regrettable and foreign to the state's public spirit.  "It
was clear that '96 would be a disaster if there wasn't some intervention,"
Hamburger recalled.  "Everyone I talked to expressed a desire to end the
cycle.  But they also felt locked into a system that went against their
better judgment." 
        Reviewing these facts, Hamburger came up with an idea.  He called
it the "Minnesota Compact," a proposal floated with the aim of improving
public dialogue during the 1996 Senate race in his state.  The compact
addressed all the familiar frustrations with electoral politics: the lack
of thoughtful discussion, the attack ads that do so much to heighten
public cynicism, horse-race coverage that fails to connect with people's
central concerns, and citizens who turn away in boredom or revulsion. 

        The Minnesota Compact was designed to break the lock and make it
possible for the state's "better judgment" to win out.  It had four parts:

        1.) Eight debates or "community discussions" would be organized by
a private sponsor during the 1996 Senate race, one in each congressional
district, some on single topics like welfare or education.  Press
conferences following the event would allow for follow-up questions.  Only
the candidates who agreed to the compact would be invited to participate.
        2) "Candidates must face the camera for the duration of any paid
political advertising submitted for television broadcast.  There is no
restriction on what the candidate might say.  But the use of prepared film
footage--whether dramatizing the threat of a released convict or a
candidate's face morphing into that of an unpopular figure--would be
prohibited.  Candidates who breach this plank of the compact would be
ineligible to participate in the debates."
        
	3.) "News organizations would emphasize the substantive concerns of
citizens, addressing competing proposals for dealing with those concerns
with the gusto we reserve for coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial or the
Super Bowl."  Journalists would agree to "cover the debates and follow-up
press conferences, emphasize substance over style in campaigns, and
provide in-depth coverage of community concerns."  Editors would be held
"responsible for making measurable changes." 
        
	4.) "Minnesota citizens commit ourselves to participating, setting clearer
and higher standards for political discourse among candidates and
citizens.  Citizens will designate an hour before the first fall debate to
consider what's at stake in the election..  And for one hour on each of
the subsequent debate days, families and churches and labor groups and
private clubs will gather together, participating in a statewide
discussion.  We're accustomed to hosting gatherings like this for the
Super Bowl.  We'll use the debates as an opportunity to meet together to
talk about common concerns-- and to demand restoration of rational
thinking and discussion in our political contests." 

        Hamburger's hope was to encourage broad public investment in an
alternative style of discourse, one that might prevail over the
destructive cycle of attack ads and the "soundbite" politics they had
engendered.  Aware of the ferment surrounding public journalism, Hamburger
had come to believe that he and his colleagues were not exempt from acting
against the decline of public discourse and its predictable result: deeper
cynicism.  "One thing we should be willing to stand for as journalists is
high quality public dialogue," he said.  "Not only should we call for
quality, we can go on to advocate it and suggest ways to bring it about. 
And it's in our interest to do so."  Hamburger called newspapers "one of
the last common denominators in American society," well-suited to be a
caretaker of public discussion.  "We have a role in helping the community
identify its concerns and get them resolved," he observed.  "If the system
gets off track, if we aren't really talking about common problems, then
it's our responsibility to call the debate back, and keep the discussion
focused." 
        
	By speaking in the "we" voice, the Minnesota Compact incorporated
the press into the statewide political community, giving it a duty to
support civic traditions now threatened with eclipse.  It also challenged
the fiction of the journalist as someone without a political life, for in
trying to rescue Minnesota from a fate that has befallen other polities,
Hamburger was clearly standing up for a certain kind of politics--grounded
in oratory, rational argument, civility and public deliberation--against
the "attack" style, which is image-based....
        
	Wary of proceeding alone, Hamburger chose to draw on America's oldest
political tradition: the notion of a compact, mutually-binding on all who
join it.  Far from destroying the independence or freedom of the press,
the compact actually honors these principles, for only those who are free
and independent can agree to be mutually bound.  By acknowledging their
duty to "emphasize substance over style in campaigns, and provide in-depth
coverage of community concerns," news organizations were to make public
use of their freedom and link their First Amendment guarantees to
important principles of accountability.  They would declare what they are
willing to be "for." 
        
	The Star-Tribune was not willing to push the Minnesota Compact as
it own "cause."  It simply gave one of its reporters the space in which to
propose it.  As it happened, two powerful figures in the state--former
Congressmen Tim Penny, a Democrat, and Vin Weber, a Republican--saw wisdom
in the idea and agreed to collaborate in hopes of making it happen.  They
helped gather together a network of civic, academic and church groups to
refine the compact and turn it into a workable document.  (Hamburger's
involvement had ended by this point.)  Chaired by Penny, the Minnesota
Compact Coalition adopted a version of the original proposal with these
four planks:

        * The compact calls on candidates to participate in at least two
substantive, informative debates.
        * The compact challenges candidates to take responsibility for all
ads on behalf of their campaigns and to refrain from false and misleading
attacks.
        * The compact asks the news media to cover the substance of
political campaigns instead of focusing on "horse race" stories, attacks
and controversy for controversy's sake.
        * The compact invites citizens to reinstate the honored tradition
of community-level political discussions.[Hamb, S-T, Oct. 31, 1996]

        Although the coalition was unable to get agreement from the two
leading Senate candidates, it did succeed in Minnesota's First
Congressional District, where Republican incumbent Gil Gutnecht and
Democratic challenger Mary Rieder agreed to be bound by the compact's
terms and a separate advertising code developed by an ad executive in the
state who wanted to see candidates take the high road.  These signed
agreements were nonetheless voluntary and unenforceable by law; as the
campaign wore on, both candidates complained about violations in the
advertisements that each side aired. 
        
	But they also felt constrained by the agreement.  Reider noted that she
and her opponent "said in effect we want to run a hard campaign but don't
want to have ourselves made a mockery of."  As she met with other female
candidates around the country and was told to prepare for the attack-style
of campaigning, her revulsion surfaced:  "It made me sick to my stomach...
hearing they would try to go after you and your family.  I felt better
knowing the compact was in place."  She added that her advertising
consultant in Washington thought that his "creativity" had been hampered
by the compact's terms, a sentiment shared by Gutnecht's ad expert, who
told Hamburger that there were things he wanted to try but couldn't
because the agreement was in place.  Which was precisely the point: to
place limits on what the consultants could "create" as they tried to
defeat the opposition. 

        Here, then, was a case in which Tom Hamburger, a political
journalist, felt he had something to offer his state that went beyond a
chroncile of depressing events.  His idea sparked the imaginations of
other actors who shared the same desire for a better civic climate and
agreed to cooperate.  It illuminated the possibilities of action in the
face of national trends that appeared irresistible.  It brought to life
the ancient wisdom of the political compact and made it seem relevant to
the politics of today.  And it worked to bring two politicians together in
an attempt to avoid the spiral of mutual destruction. 
        
Rieder and Gutnecht still went at each other with vigor and in some cases
an excess of zeal.  They accused each other of violating the code.  Their
contest did not become a civics class or a polite discussion among
friendly rivals, merely because they had signed a pact.  But they did
prove that there were alternatives to the ruling ethic: "destroy your
opponent and do it early."  In Minnesota, politics didn't have to be what
it was elsewhere.  So said one reporter, moved by the spirit of public
journalism.  How many citizens, greeted by the nightly spectacle of attack
ads, might have longed for that spirit to show in their own precincts?

So, fellow commissoners.  What do you think?

From: Jay Rosen <rosen@IS2.NYU.EDU>
Subject:      Re: thoughts & plans

To:     Penn Commission, leadership collegaues
>From    Jay Rosen
Re:     Possible directions

In an e-mail to us this summer, Michael Schudson asked us to be thinking
about what we can best accomplish, given the Commission's aims and our own
talents and limitations.  These are good questions.

Michael, I believe, is right that our hesitation about offering a standard
commission "report," while wise, shouldn't blind us to the fact that what
we do best is read, think and write.

So we need to find other ways of reporting out the work we do, if what we
don't what to do is file a predictable report.  And, Michael reminds us,
we need to limit our inquiry to some piece of the leadership puzzle, if
we're going to contribute anything of distinctive value. 

I offer for some thoughts to consider-- and a suggestion.

My own feeling is that we should focus on opening up lines of possibility: 
that is, we employ civic imagination ourselves.  What may be distinctive
about our report or product will be our ability to imagine a better civic
culture because we convened, "commished," brought our diverse knowledge to
bear on a well-framed problem.  What the problem should be is our first
act of imagination, begun at the initial meeting.  We said: we want to
study leadership that leads to an improved public climate.  But Michael
says "leadership" is too broad.  We have found the territory; we need a
better map. 

So here's my suggestion:

Maybe we should be asking: what would constitute creative acts of
leadership, not in a fuzzy and general way--for there are all kinds of
leaders and a huge, unwieldy literature on the subject--but specifically
on this: leadership in the realm of public discourse.  What we might call
"discourse leadership" (or "leadership through public talk") involves: 

* speaking out on matters of general import;
* conducting, staging, framing, reporting on and otherwise constructing
public debate for others-- as the news media does, for example;
* participating in public debate as one among many speakers, in forums
where the clash of views is expected, and yet the chance to expand our
view is also present;
* exercising civic imagination, developing the art of possibility, making
space for genuine deliberation and otherwise adding to our capacity for
intelligent public talk-- moving the discussion along, in other words;
* entering our contentious, lively but in some ways dysfunctional public
climate with sharp and passionate views that nonetheless leave room for
others to disagree, without going to war with you-- the "civlity" question
without the dreaded word.
* plus many others I have not thought of here.

Our focus might fall on especially visible people--leaders, however we
define them--those from whom the society or local community often hears. 
How might ask how *could* they conduct themselves as public figures if
what they wanted to do was exercise some leadership, break out of familiar
patterns, dare to be different, take a chance now and then, show the way
to others in improving public conversation? 

This is quite different than asking about leadership in general because it
narrows in on the acts of speaking, listening and making room for others,
and for imagination, in the sphere of public talk.

It seems to me that the best thing our group could do is try to imagine
ourselves what the national and local culture of debate would look or
sound like... if we had more people concerned about the quality of public
discussion, trying to do something about it by behaving in a different
way.  This is something we could research, talk over and write about. 

Just to take one example, when two candidates, goaded by public pressure
and concerned about their own families and reputations, sign a pledge to
restrain themselves in their campaign advertisements by, say, not
permitting their consultants to engage in gratuitous personal attacks on
the opponent, that's "discourse leadership," of a kind.  Not only by the
candidates themselves, but by the groups and individuals that called for
this kind of voluntary action and helped administer the agreement.  It
happened in a Minnesota congressional race in 1996, as my previous message
to the list described.

To offer another example, I would love to hear Bill Wilson, Amy Gutmann
and the rest of us discuss what would constitute "discourse leadership" on
matters of race and poverty.  And simply having good discussions is part
of our job-- part of the fun, too. 

In general, I don't think we should shrink from what might be called acts
of public dreaming: conjuring up a world in which the country and the
community have better discussions, where the possible meanings of "better" 
are made more visible to more people, more often, by more and more folks
in the chattering classes. 

Who are they?  Journalists, writers, scholars, editors, publicists, public
officials, candidates, interest groups, activists, political operatives,
university presidents, corporate chiefs, professional associations,
foundation folk, school administrators, police chiefs, heads of
neighborhood organizations, PTA presidents, union officers-- all might be
seen as discourse leaders, able to show the way to better public talk.

If we can imagine a path they can follow, tell good stories about those
who did, or offer suggestions on how to cultivate such leadership, perhaps
we can do some good ourselves.  And maybe we can "report" out our work in
some creative and arresting fashion. 

This idea has a long way to go before it becomes concrete enough to be
workable.  And we may not agree it's a good direction.  So I conclude by
asking: What do you folks think?

From: Michael Schudson <mschudso@WEBER.UCSD.EDU>
Subject:      getting in gear

"Leadership" colleagues--

I want to respond to Jay Rosen's very helpful recent messages and I want
also to let you know that between now and the end of October I'll try to
reach each of you by phone to see what you're thinking about how to
proceed. I'd like to have enough communication with you over the next 2
months so that we can sit down in Washington in December with a reasonably
focused agenda and some ideas for how we want to structure the June
meeting in Chicago (because it is ours to organize). 

On Jay's idea that we focus on "discourse leadership": as I've said to
Jay, the part of this notion I don't like is that it limits us to
"discourse"  when there are lots of other dimensions of leadership as or
more important;  what I do like about it is that "discourse" is one of the
dimensions of leadership where our particular group has some considerable
expertise. Let me go a next step: if we accepted Jay's idea, what might we
do with it? Here's one possibility: let's think about the variety of modes
of discourse-in-public that we find admirable -- I think it would be
misleading to assume that there is only one ideal mode of democratic and
civil discourse. What does discourse look like normally and at its best in
a jury room? What does discourse look like normally and at its best in a
medical consultation? in a psychoanalytic interview? in a seminar? in a
public meeting? in the peer review process at NSF? in a town meeting? in
the chambers of the Supreme Court? in a college admissions process? in a
news conference to determine tomorrow's front page?  in collective
bargaining? 

If we imagined writing a book together in which each person pursued a
chapter on one of those domains, I think we'd have made a significant
contribution.  Would we find some common threads? Probably. And some
context-specific stories to tell? Probably. And perhaps we could free up
ours and our readers' views about what desirable "discourse" in a
democratic, civil society can at its best look like. 

That's at least one way to take Jay's original idea that I think we could
actually achieve and actually do some good with. Not that anyone signed on
to start a research project and write a book chapter! But maybe some of us
would be interested or maybe we can find, and commission, others well
equipped to do parts of this. 

Or maybe nothing is further from what you had in mind. But I don't know
what you have in mind because scarcely anyone in any of the 3 groups has
taken advantage of our e-mail listserv to date. So I will call you. About
this idea.  About your ideas. About anything you'd like me to do as chair
of our group. 

(The other thing I am doing: is gathering info. on leadership programs,
leadership training institutes, etc around the country -- just to get the
lay of the land and make sure we don't start off on something that
re-invents a wheel that is spinning along just fine.) 

You can also call me: 6l9/534-2370 at the office, I'm in generally M-F
9:l5-4:30, with a msg machine if you miss me.

Michael

P.S. to Derek Bok, Richard Lapchick, Michael Sandel, Bill Wilson or anyone
else in the Boston area: I'll be in Boston Friday morning Oct 3 and Monday
morning Oct 6 and would be happy to convene a mini-group of us over coffee
one of those mornings if you are interested and available. (I have to
leave for a meeting in Worcester Oct 3 by l0:30 and get to a lunch at
Boston College by l2 Oct 6, where a variety of people interested in
discussing "civil society" will gather -- if you want to join us for that,
let me know.  I'm giving a talk there at 2 on "Political Paradox: The
Widening Web of Citizenship and the 'Decline' of the Citizen.")
