SUBJECT: Summary of Working Group Meeting - 6/12/97

The following is a summary of the first meeting of the Working Group on
21st Century Community.  I believe it reflects the main points that were
addressed and puts them all in the tripartite framework proposed by the
group's chair, Joyce Appleby.

I have also included some questions for possible discussion on the working
group listserv. They are designed to continue the provocative conversation
initiated in Philadelphia.  To respond to all members of the Working Group

PNC Working Group on 21st Century Community
Chair:  Joyce Appleby

The Working Group on 21st Century Community of the Penn National
Commission on Society, Culture and Community began its work by conducting
a wide ranging discussion on the nature and meaning of community.  Issues
of popular culture, values, civic spaces, and the arts, and their
relationships to concepts of community were all placed on the table.  The
group concluded by outlining a series of questions to be investigated and
tasks to be performed.  These questions and tasks will be undertaken in a
three step process of exploration, definition and recommendation. 

Exploration

The first task for the group will be to investigate the types of
communities which exist or are emerging today.  This will be done through
approaches to states' humanities councils, surveys of the internet, and
communication with other groups working in this area. 

The group will look at the goals communities pursue and the tasks they set
for themselves.  Members expressed interest in exploring communities of
purpose and affinity, as well as distinguishing those seeking positive
goals from those which exist for negative purposes (e.g., lynch mobs.) 
Examples of successful and unsuccessful communities will be sought; 
points of commonality and difference will be determined.  This will allow
the group to develop models of community which will be the basis for much
of its later work. 

During this phase, the working group will also seek to enlarge its
membership by going outside the confines of the PNC.  Expanding the
diversity of the group was seen as essential for the success of the
group's efforts. 


Definition

Having acquired data and developed models, the group will seek definitions
for several key concepts and answers to major questions.  For example,
what are the preconditions for community?  Among possible answers offered
at the meeting were affection and common purpose or common values, myths
and norms. 

A quality of openness to other groups was recognized as a positive feature
for subcommunities and communities operating in a democratic society. 
However, others noted that for some groups a degree of exclusivity is
central to the achievement of their goals.  What is the proper
relationship between the need for communal exclusivity and openness to
others? 

What can be learned from racially or ethnically based communities?  Can
successes found in these groups be used by others trying to forge creative
linkages across such divides?

Communities that play a public role, either deliberative or active, will
be especially important to the group as well as determining how more
private communities affect the larger civic community. 


Recommendations

The working group will initiate approaches in different areas.  Four
specific areas emerged from the discussions:

1. Internet.  The internet is forcing us all to rethink many of the
central notions of community such as geographical proximity and temporal
commitment.  It is acting as a wellspring for new and often spontaneous
communities.  At the same time, it is feeding a culture of misinformation,
negativity, and incivility.  The working group will seek concrete ways to
make the internet a creative force for building and sustaining community. 

2.  "New Communities."  In addition to the internet, new forms of
community are emerging all around us.  The group will actively seek out
groups, both in the US and abroad, which are seeking to form new
communities through unconventional techniques.  The role the arts can play
in bringing people from diverse backgrounds together will be emphasized. 

3.  Universities.  University communities were held up as exemplars of the
challenges to and opportunities for contemporary community.  The
significant issues facing institutions of higher education (e.g., the
canon, affirmative action, fragmentation of the student body, housing) are
all at base questions of community.

4. "Community of Citizens." In this phase, the group will also address the
relationship between communities and the larger "community of
citizenship."  Ways in which communities might act to create civic spaces
for the discussion of public issues and the re-engagement of citizens in
political processes will be explored, developed, and promoted. 


Questions for Discussion

1.  Are there any corrections, additions, or deletions you would make to
this summary?

2.  What would be the best way for the group to increase its diversity ?

3.  Would it be useful, at this stage, for the group to commission
research?  If so, what should be the focus of this initial research?

4.  The group is scheduled to present its findings at the plenary meeting
to be held in Los Angeles in December 1998.  What sort of timetable should
the group set up for its work?

5.  Creating new communities through electronic communication will be one
of the focuses of this group's investigations.  As we work together to
form our own community, largely via the listserv, are there ways you think
would be useful in making this a more meaningful and successful
experience?

Fellow Committee Members:

I think that the minutes fairly accurately represent the various lines of
discussion at the meeting.  I think that the first order is to diversify
the committee's membership.  The other concern I have is to sharpen the
focus.  At the risk of pushing my own agenda, let me suggest that are the
core of our concern was a fairly simple question (double question, in
fact).  First let me establish a premise that I think is empirically valid
and probably shared by us all:  there is no absence of communities; the
question is the kind of communities.  And what is the question we would
ask of them?

1. What kinds of community enrich civic life (or the "community of
citizens," our largest "national" community)?

2. What kinds of community seem to leach or weaken our civic life (or
"community of citizens").

While I have no problem with the nationalist quality of this phrasing, it
is important to recognize both that some communities are transnational and
that there are human unities that should concern us that extend beyond our
national borders (a larger cosmopolitanism).

With these two questions, however, I think we can develop some fairly
sharp analytic questions that would follow naturally--and it is those for
which we might need some research, pointing toward typologies.

Hope this helps.
Tom Bender

Many thanks, Tom.  I agree with your premise that we must be well
focussed.  I've been away for a week and will get back to this next
Monday. Joyce

Bill -- I want to write Rodriguez and invited him to join the task force.
Is there any remuneration envisioned for such participation?  Joyce

Subject:      Re: Summary of Working Group Mtg

I just got back to find your summary of the working group meeting.  It
will take me a little time to digest and think about it.  But on quick
reading, it seems to me that a really critical question that was not
highlighted is how groups interact with each other, not simply how open
the groups are to outsiders in the sense of membership but how open
communication and interchange is across the frontiers of the various
groups into which society is divided.  Much of the discussion seemed to me
to suppose that "society"  is constructed by citizens who meet together in
some kind of public space or forum.  I guess I think that "society" is
constructed much more by more selective communication across boundaries,
or that the kind of public forum only works if there is a lot of more
"private" communication across the boundaries of different groups.

It looks great, Bill.  Thanks for making my suggested changes.  I shall be
back in touch with you next week.  I have some ideas on several fronts.
