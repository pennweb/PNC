<p>
JUDITH RODIN:  ...but we'll have Professor Marty taking us
through the rest.  Thank you.
<p>
MARTIN MARTY:  One, two, three.  You look at your agenda, you'll
see that I'm TBA, the moderator, on relatively short notice.  And
my main criterion is I own three watches, and I'm really supposed to
be riding the 15-minute rules, so we get some good summary discussion
at the end, too.  But we're going to have three rich presentations.
Throughout this day and a half we've talked about what Calvin Trillin
called this morning examples.  And we're now going to get into that
practical stage by taking three such examples.
<p>
It may well be that the steering committee and the plenary group may
later on say one of the best ways to disseminate some of the things
we're about is through examples, through concrete cases, and that's
exactly where we're moving now with interesting stories.  The first is
by Mari Fitzduff, director of the Northern Ireland Community
Relations Council, spending the 1990s in one of the more volatile
areas of the world working on conflict resolution, and taking some of
the things that she has taught and learned to other parts of the
world--Middle East, Sri Lanka, Russia and elsewhere, and is producing
a source book on conflict resolution that has been translated into
Russian and Croatian, and I hope many more languages will give
it an opportunity to spread it even further.  Lecturer Fitzduff,
please. <p>

MARI FITZDUFF:  Good afternoon, folks.  You can all hear me, I
hope, and I wish you a comfortable lunch.  I hope your digestion is
not going to be disturbed by having to listen to all these fairly
fast-paced presentations, I think.  Could I just say I want to thank
you for giving me an opportunity to be with you and to be part of your
conversations.  I'm never quite sure whether I should be consoled or
depressed by hearing the echoes of many of our own dilemmas in some of
what you said, although, obviously, ours are caricatured and
exaggerated.
<p>
I'm consoled because I think before Yugoslavia, we did think perhaps
there was something wrong with us as a race of peoples on the island
of Ireland, or depressed by the fact that we are now actually
realizing that many of the issues that we are facing are likely to
proliferate throughout the world.  In that sense, I think the
conversations that we are having are of relevance not just to here but
much further afield.
<p>
We've been talking about the media.  You may be interested to
note that I've lost count of the times of which the media have asked
me to explain the Northern Ireland situation in one minute or less.
Sound bites has indeed reached us with a vengeance.  I was interested
to see--and those of you who saw the recent Michael Collins
film--that, in fact, they just had Collins disappear at the time when
the Northern Ireland situation had to be discussed.  You may remember,
those of you who saw [it], that for four months, he went to London to try
and carve out some sort of compromise that would deal with fact that
we had a million Protestants who were the descendants of the colonists
who came in the 17th and 18th century from Scotland and England, who
did not want, frankly, to be forced into a poor and Catholic Ireland.
They glossed over that.
<p>
I will presume that most of you have, certainly, sort of a
competent understanding of the Northern Ireland situation, and
therefore, I'll just start by reiterating very, very briefly, probably
about 30 seconds, the main divisions as they exist.
<p>
<center>

<p>
I am frequently asked, 'Is it a problem of religion?' Of course, it's
not a problem just of religion.  It is a problem of religion,
compounded by history, politics and by culture, by our attitudes
towards the police, and by the segregated living and work and social
patterns that we have.  
<p>
[Insertion of text from prepared remarks: Religion and Politics tend to be
synonymous in Northern Ireland, with Catholics generally voting for
nationalist parties, and Protestants voting for unionist parties.  Almost
all Protestants still wish to retain the constitutional link with Britain,
many continuing to fear decreased material well-being and the possible
excessive influence of Catholicism in a united Ireland.  There are two
main political parties in favour of the retention of the union with
Britain, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party
(DUP), who between them poll about 55 per cent of the total vote.  In
addition, the Alliance Party ... is broadly in favour of the retention of
the union ...]
<p>

[Referencing overhead transparency -- "Northern Ireland - A Divided
Society] Some of these have slipped on the computer,[the graphic here,
online, has been restored to the original form] so lest this be
transferred at home, let me remind you alliance, in fact, should be more
towards this section.  But it is interesting to note the alliance, which
is seen as a compromise party, regularly only gains about 8 percent of the
votes. <p>

[Insertion of text from prepared remarks: The main democratic proponent of
the desire for a united Ireland is the mainly Catholic Social Democratic
and Labour Party (SDLP) which consistently polls about 20 per cent of the
vote.  Sinn Fein - a party which advocates a joint "bomb and ballot"
electoral approach, consistently polls between 10 and 12 per cent of the
electoral vote in Northern Ireland and about 2 per cent the Republic of
Ireland.]
<p>
I did put in the women's coalition, because in the last election,
within six weeks they had garnered 1 percent of the votes, which is
not bad.  But the interesting thing about that party is, it is totally
a process party.  It takes no line on the political constitution
solution.  It takes a line that it is available to facilitate the
process.  It has, however, within its party, people who come from very
strongly republican positions and loyalist positions.  And, actually,
it has been an amazing achievement.  I must say that the
sectarianism has been overwhelmed by the amount of sexism that they have
met, because politics in Northern Ireland is almost a completely male
process. <p>

A couple of other things to notice is education.  State schools, which
are in theory multidenominational, only have 4 percent Catholics.  And
we have managed now--integrated schools, again, should be under
here [gestures toward center column] --instead of having one
integrated school, which we had 15 years
ago, we now have 33 integrated schools, which take between 2 percent
and 3 percent of the population.  The more interesting statistic is
that about 70 percent of our parents--both Catholics and Protestants;
there's not much difference between them--actually would like
integrated schooling for their children if it were readily accessible.
<p>
The other interesting fact is that, en masse, the churches totally
oppose it.  And the Catholic church, for instance, has even refused to
give chaplains the sacraments at one stage to teach Catholic children
who went to integrated schools.  So that is the level of feeling with
which we're addressing a lot of this.  The other statistic,
just before I move on, is this statistic:  Roughly 60 percent
Protestant, 40 percent Catholic, but you will notice there the figure,
55 percent of the school leaders are Catholic.  This, of course, is
highly problematic for a Protestant population that is already
feeling very besieged. <p>

Now we were set up in 1990.  And we were surprised no one had thought
of the idea before, to actually look at the whole question of
fostering community relations.  Now one of the first things we
did was draw up a strategy that may be of some use to you, because we
quickly discovered for ourselves that there was no point in trying to
do community relations unless we actually tackled the rest of these
issues. <p>

<center>
<img src=fitz2.gif>
</center>
<p>


Let me give you an example--echo some of what you've said here:  If
you try and address equity without having dialogue between the
communities, those Protestants who are losing their jobs presume
they're going to Catholics and, therefore, you've even more tension on
the streets.  If you try and do equity work without doing economic
development, there are not enough jobs to go around.  If, for
instance, you do law and order in such a way--it was very problematic
in the 1980s--where it actually increases support for paramilitarism,
then, in fact, you were actually counterproductive,
in terms of the idea of containment of paramilitarism. <p>

Just to tell you that the end game at the moment is, as we say--and
I think I'll talk about this very briefly later on, approaching.
But one of the main strategies we have been developing is the movement
of people from paramilitarism into political activity and into
community development and leadership. <p>

The problem and the reason we had, for instance, the Canary Wharf
bombing and some of the other bombings is that we have not as yet
managed to find roles for some of those, though they know
the paramilitary war is over, their meaning has not as yet--their
energy has not as yet found another way to express itself.  We still
continue to move on that, and I will come back to it. <p>

Can I just say, one of the things we very quickly discovered was that
if you focus on where the violence or the tension is, in fact, it is
an inadequate approach.  If you would go to an area where there has
been, in your case, racial violence, in our case, sectarian violence,
and assume that they have the capacity to deal with it, it is
misplaced.  The power, for the most part, to change society does not
actually lie where violence is expressed.  That has been our
experience.

<p>
<center>
<img src=fitz3.gif>
</center>
<p>


<p>
Therefore, the other strategy you had was very much at working at the
three different levels.  The main power broker level--so, for
instance, we would be facilitating groups and resourcing groups--we
are a resourcing agency--who would be working on rumor control,
developing cease-fires, etc.  Power holders; we would be resourcing
groups for working within the trade unions to address intimidation,
and at community power level we would be funding, for instance, groups
of interfaith workers who move across the peace line so that they can
ensure that loyalists, republicans, Catholics and Protestants can
address common social issues.
<p>
Now I would say that the area that is most neglected in change is
actually the central area, to which I think most people in this area
belong.  And this is my suggestion yesterday--that if you don't
actually engage with those who are the power brokers--and I don't
understand your power net, but certainly for us it is very much around
governments and politicians.  And if you don't, furthermore, engage
with strategies so that what you're saying and talking about can
actually be translated into action at community level, in the end, you
will find that the lack of work at any of those levels is likely to
mean that your work will be less productive than it might be.
<p>
<center>
<img src=fitz4.gif>

</center>
<p>
Another one of the issues--and it's interesting, because I've heard a
lot of echoes here, in terms of the focus on, for
instance, relationships vs.  rights.  When we came on the scene in
1990, it was very clear to us that a lot of energy was going
on the conflict between those who wanted to address, as it were, the
problems to the Northern Ireland solution, but who wanted to address
it in different ways. <p>

So, for instance, we had in one corner a group arguing, `You've got to
look at equity work and you've got to look at political solutions.'
And in the other corner we had a group saying, `No, we've got to look
at cultural diversity and understanding and respect,' and ne'er the
twain would meet.  And it was amazing the amount of energy
that was being lost through that.  Well, what we did was we just
defined the whole lot, in a sense, as community relations.  And it
actually has had a significant effect, because what we are now saying
is that community relations addresses the hard and the soft issues.
<p>
So all of our groups are equipping themselves, as it were, to look at
issues of rights and issues of justice, but doing it in such a way
that, in fact, they can come to collective, agreed solutions.  And
this, for us, has been important, because if you don't address both
the structural and the psychocultural aspects,
we have noticed it is a tendency, as it were, for energy to
be lost in addressing it. <p>

<center>
<img src=fitz5.gif>
</center>



<p>
I brought this along because I thought it would
be useful.  It's a contact model that we
use for our work.  Just a brief word about the council; the council
itself has 21 members that are drawn right across the political
spectrum.  They are--a third of them are government appointees; the
rest, as it were, are appointed from among the members themselves.
And they do bring a lot of credibility.  They do bring people right
through the social spectrum, right through the power spectrum and
right through the political spectrum.
<p>
We do not ask that they give up their political positions.  We only
ask that they are committed to a process of dialogue about those
political positions.  The council itself maintains a very small staff
very deliberately, because our sense is that the work needs to be done
through every institution in society and not through an agency like
ourselves.  Its budget at the moment is approximately six or seven
million.  Most of that goes in actually funding a lot of groups to do
the work.  And this is on the basis that the best ideas for dealing
with conflict often come from groups themselves in different areas.
<p>
And hardly a day goes by--for instance, this summer threw up an
amazing number of very creative ways to actually deal with the tension
and of the parades on the streets.  But when groups come to us, very
often they would be in the position, in the first place, of never
having met someone who came from a different community.  You can
literally live--I don't know if it's true in your cities and
towns and villages--we can live in our area till you're 16, 17, 18 and
not have met a Catholic if you're a Protestant or a Protestant if
you're a Catholic, and certainly not have had a qualitative
relationship where you would feel easy with people from a
different culture tradition to yourselves.
<p>
So often groups come to do what we call contact work.  It is initial
contact work.  The next time we come, we say, 'Look,
...(unintelligible) contact really is not very effective.' The best
thing we know about conflict resolution, or one of the few things we
know, actually, is when you get people to work together on common
issues about their common future, you are likely to increase respect
and understanding.  So we will try and move them up to sustained
programs on unemployment, economic development, etc.
<p>
Third time round, we say, 'OK, folks, you've been meeting with one
another for six months looking at this.  How about raising some
contentious issues?  What about policing in your areas?  What about
political constitutions?' So, again, we're moving the stakes up all
the time until they can come to the whole question of agreed options,
positive diversity, etc., in that--I haven't time to talk about it,
but identity is fascinating in that and, actually, our own experience
has been that identity can be actually changeable according
to circumstances. <p>

Now this [gesturing towards yellow triangle in "Contact Model" figure] has
been very important to us and it may be of some use
to you.  What we quickly discovered was that if we brought a group of
Protestants together or Catholics together who actually hadn't first
discussed their own perspective on the situation or on other groups,
what happened when you brought the groups together was
aggression and hostility that often came from a confusion about their
own position, and therefore the hardest position had to be taken.
<p>
So a lot of our work has been about, in the first instance, single
identity work.  But we do write in that at some stage there actually
is a stage in what we call outreach or contact work, so that if, for
instance, somebody that comes from a ground to do single identity
work--among the Protestants, a lot of it has been about the whole
sense of loss because the British have decided that at some stage they
could bring themselves to leave Northern Ireland, and the whole
question of what that would mean in terms of identity for
Protestants--we would try to ensure that that's not continued on a
single-identity basis; otherwise, it just can increase ghettoization
and not increase the sort of contact that we actually feel that
is needed.
<p>
<center>
<img src=fitz6.gif>
</center>

<p>

Now, briefly, these are the three issues that inform our work.
They'll be familiar to you, I think; particularly, the first.  There
is no point in moving on any of this unless you actually have
equity as a principle, as a norm, and endorsed in our laws.  And the
second one for us has been diversity, because certainly the threat
that people felt in terms of our work was very much the threat of the
grayness of being lost and the whole sense of their own particular
belonging somehow being submerged into a greater need for political
harmony. <p>

Now our experience has been that that actually just does not work.
So, in fact, the whole question of diversity work--affirming
confidence.  But confidence that is very much a part of our increasing
confidence not to assert yourself alone but assert yourself in
relation to others has actually been very important. <p>

And the third one has become increasingly important.  The whole need
to acknowledge what we call interdependence, which is the third strand
of all of our work, and that is the interdependence that actually
acknowledges that we live in streets that are side by side one
another, that we have got common problems that for the most part,
barring a mass exodus or bad mass ethnic cleansing, which I hope we've
gone beyond, we actually would have to continue to work together.  And
the whole thing that is around for us now as we move towards political
solutions that will take some time is the whole question of management
in a divided society.
<p>
Most of you will have seen our screens and been quite depressed last
summer--the whole question of parading on the streets.  Yes, of
course, we were depressed.  And it was, however, nevertheless, an
extraordinarily good year for us; although there was aggression and
tension there were no deaths.  But it has thrown into question the
whole sense of need for collective agreements about managing divisions
within our society.  And it's extraordinary the amount of work that's
actually going on that very issue of managing division.
<p>
And when I talk about the work going on, I really do mean at every
level, all of those three levels I've spoken about.  At one level,
it's policy development.  At another level, it's incorporating yet
mainstreaming within statutory bodies, and at the third level it's
very much about hundreds of groups at local level actually looking at
a lot of these issues together.  And these were the kind of policies
that may be of some interest to you. <p>
<center>
<img src=fitz7.gif>


</center>


<p>
The equity policies--I was interested to hear somebody bringing up the
issue of class--Was it you, Donald?--bringing up the issue of class
because there is a whole confusion about this.  The first
one's just FEC, which is laws against discrimination.  We do not have
affirmative action.  Affirmative action is illegal in Northern
Ireland.  And TSN is targeting social need, and this in a sense was a
way to deal with the continuing differences between Catholics and
Protestants.  And it was where all government policies were to be
looked at in terms of addressing that difference.  However, three
years on, there still remains a confusion about whether this is
about Catholics or those who are poor.
<p>
I mean--and my own sense is we should be actually very up front about
it being about those who are poor rather than
those who are Catholics.  

One of the things--the triangles we use that might be useful is we use
this triangle to look at-- [draws on chart, reproduced here:]

<p>
<center>
<img src=fitz8.gif>
</center>
<p>
the larger
triangle, for instance, is Protestants.  The smaller triangle is
Catholics.  But it does mean below the line, you actually have people
who are finding themselves marginalized without a system, in terms of
poverty, who are both Protestants and Catholics.  And it does mean
that you, of course, have, similarly, people who are middle-class and
wealthy who are Catholics.  You just don't happen to have quite
so many. <p>

So it actually gets you--if you take the class issue and the poverty
issue, my own sense is that TSN should actually very much look at the
poverty and the below-the-line issue rather than looking at Catholics.
Catholics is too problematic, particularly for those of our angry,
marginalized, working-class Protestants who feel that they are being
totally left out of the process, and I suspect you have something like
that in terms of marginalized white people here as well.
<p>
And the second is the policy on diversity.  You would find it hard to
believe how
much the whole culture--Irish culture was actually left out of the
equation until 1969.  It was, for instance, illegal to
show what your aspiration was for a republic.  It was
illegal to use--you could not use the Irish language in many
situations.  We have transformed that fairly rapidly within the last
10 years.  It is now legal to use the Irish language.  We have
Irish-language schools.  In fact, the radio stations, which
never used the Irish language--now frequently we have discussions,
etc., in Irish.
<p>
So that, in a sense, has been done, and at a statutory level.  This
initiative of the last one, their interdependence,
is one we're actually moving towards, and I think it's going to be
very, very controversial.  We've just started to get some policymakers
and lawyers to draw it up.  And this is another policy initiative.  I
think it will be controversial as much because another policy
initiative is going to exhaust people.  But also it is a policy on
separation and sharing.  This is where we would require government
departments who, for instance, are looking at local economic
development or local development of leisure centers, to actually look
at the capacity for ensuring that they are available for sharing
rather than for affirming separation, which is what most policies do
at the moment. <p>

And there actually is a huge backing for this kind of work because all
of the evidence shows--I've already said 70 percent of parents would
like shared schools.  Eighty percent of folk would like shared working
places and a similar figure would like shared living places.  There's
usually a few percentages lower on the Protestants, but overall, there
is a very high percentage actually wanting shared options, provided
they feel safe.  And the other level, of course, is the comfort level
of children choosing and providing it is convenient.
<p>
But that, I think, is going to be quite a controversial one.  But we
are so disturbed by the fact that only 7 percent of us live in
culturally balanced areas, which inevitably means that the work that's
happening through the schools is being lost because of the lack of
conversations that happen with parents at home about the future.
<p>

<p>
OK.  Finally, I will just briefly run through them here--about diversity
work and validating
diversity.  And somebody here is going to talk about drama.  Bill's going
to talk about drama.  Can I just say that we find you need a lot of
different ways to promote
this kind of work, and I want to finish up by talking about that, and
interdependence work, a lot of which is about contact.
<p>
Finally, I could go through the indices of success.  I just will say
infrastructurally they are very successful.  Intimidation's
disappeared.  Integrated schools are happening.  A lot of power
sharing happening at local councils, etc.  So we are happy that the
infrastructure's in place.  It will be quite difficult to return
en masse to violence, and particularly in equity.  And I want to
finish with this--just 30 seconds.
<p>

<center>
<img src=fitz10.gif>
</center>
<p>
What I draw out of this that I think may be of relevance here is for
us the whole sense of meaning and is extraordinarily important.  I
talked about the difficulty of shifting paramilitaries and finding a
new meaning for paramilitaries, and I just picked up this book on your
shelves.  Look at the title:  "We Wrecked the Place." It hasn't
arrived with us yet.  This is the story of our paramilitaries, only
numbering between 300 and 500, who have kept us murdering each other
for 25 years.
<p>
And I've noticed one--I happen to know most of them-- and I noticed one
talking about his involvement at first in violence, where he said--and
he talked about the media picking up their intervention:  `Suddenly,
we were living inside the reports we saw on the television news.  And
where before we went we read thrillers, we now have a chance to
star in our own home-grown, patriotic, version of heroic fantasies.'
And they took the chance.  And they did.
<p>
And I think there is a huge question about the role of the media here.
But the whole question of belonging that Edna mentioned as well--the
whole need to belong and the extraordinary need that is exemplified
throughout the world, which is why we have fragmentation such that we
may have as many as 2,000 nations within the United Nations two
decades after the millennium, is something that we need to take
account of. <p>

Change does not happen through rational discourse, and this is why the
title of this session, actually, worries me slightly.  Our experience
has been that, frankly, about 15 percent of people will change through
rational discourse.  The rest will change through experiences--drama,
music, etc.  And we are wasting a lot of time trying to
emphasize rational discourse.  That is a reality, I would suspect,
even here, where you would belong to cogitators rather than belongers.
Even you, if you think about experiences that changed you, it may not
have been a book that you read or a lecture that you heard.  It was
much more likely to be experience of meeting a
person or an emotional experience. <p>

And the final, final thing I want to say is one of the things
preventing us from moving is we do not have a rhetoric for
complexity, and I would appeal because I hear the echo of that need
here.  We do not have a rhetoric or, indeed, songs of complexity.  If
you go into any of our pubs--and please do come to Belfast and go into
them--you're not surprised people go out to murder and
kill.  The songs are about the fundamentalist kind of songs that you
hear in Bosnia that send us out to murder the other.  We don't have
the equivalent of those songs--liberality and complexity.  They are
left out of the equation.  That is an enormous task and one we need to
address. <p>

And, finally, we also need a politics that is about complexity.  In
our area, the main difficulty in moving towards complexity and
compromise, which we know we have to, is that our politicians,
frankly, know that they are going to lose.  And that is why it's going
to take us probably another two years to get to a political agreement.
Thank you. <p>

MARTY:  Thank you.  I'm glad this is being filmed.
I think the steering committee will play this back at half-time
because it's a whole course.  It was very rich. <p>
