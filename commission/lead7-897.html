Dear "Leadership" Colleagues--

I'm just now freed from spring term (we quarter-system folks don't really
see summer begin until July 4) and I will shortly turn to the matter of
our working group. I am off to Wisconsin for the rest of this week, but
next week I will send you some further notes on our June meeting and a set
of questions for you about how best to organize our work over the next
months. I expect we will want to develop a general reading list for
ourselves, perhaps a more extensive bibliographic search for the staff to
read and review for us, a list of other people and organizations we should
be in contact with, and -- if we stick to some version of a "profiles in
civic leadership" concept -- continuing nominations of likely candidates
to profile. 

I expect we'll want to brainstorm further on possible "products" to be
looking toward, but that will also mean more discussion on what audience
or audiences for our efforts we should be thinking about. 

I'll be back in the office July l4 and will get back to you with a longer
memo some time that week. Hope you are having a good summer,

Michael

Subject:      Re: leadership voids: an example

To:     Leadership Subgroup
From:   Jay Rosen


Reading a recent editorial in The New Republic about Clinton's initiative
on race led me to some thoughts on why our working group is needed and
what it--and the Commission as a whole--might accomplish.  I thought I
would pass these thoughts along, for whatever they're worth. 

The editorial was called "The Healing Game" and it appeared in the June 30
issue of TNR.  In tone and stance it was typical of the biting style of
commentary for which the magazine is known.  According to the editors,
Clinton had taken a question with real gravity (race in America) and
proposed to "empty the question of its gravity."  His plan is "just plain
meretricious," for it is premised "on the notion that Americans are
misunderstanding each other, when the problem is they are understanding
each other perfectly."

Some believe in color, said TNR, while others in color-blindness.  Some
are integrationists, some separatists.  Some see in the present "the power
to annul the past," while others see the past as key to the present.  Some
believe in equality of opportunity, others in equality of result.  Some
think governments must act, others that individuals and communities are
the relevant actors.  This is our real problem, the magazine suggests. 
Conflicting principles, conflicting views, convictions that dramatically
conflict. 

But Clinton never deals with the realities of a problem.  "When he is not
merely agreeing with everyone serially," he shows the pedantry of a policy
wonk and the sentimentality of a man who feels your pain and wants you to
talk about it.  Thus, the town meetings Clinton proposed "are therapeutic
exercises masquerading as democratic exercises."  In the end, Clinton will
practice the politics of elision.  In discussing race, "the president will
not champion liberalism and will not champion conservatism.  He will
champion emotionalism."

The editorial concludes this way:  "All this is an insult to Americans,
black and white, whose lives are more and more disfigured by this curse on
our country.  If the president cannot speak about race unpolitically,
unambiguously, and unmoistly, if he insists on healing instead of leading,
then he should not speak."

Here's what struck me about this editorial as I thought about the work of
the Commission.  I think it is fair to say that the editors of The New
Republic believe themselves to be among the most sophisticated and
clear-eyed observers of the American scene.  They parade against cant,
denounce fuzzy thinking, see through all manner of deception and speak the
unvarnished truth, as they see it.  In the realm of opinion, they are
"leaders" and they cultivate that stance rather self-consciously,
particularly in lampooning what passes for leadership in Washington.

So here we have a leadership group, of a kind, ridiculing in the most
caustic manner the President's initiative on race.  Well, Clinton and his
plan may have deserved it.  I myself was not overly impressed with what
was announced in San Diego.  But the striking thing is that this editorial
includes not one word describing what, in the minds of the editors, would
constitute "leadership" on race.  Not a word.  There is not an idea in
there about what Clinton or the rest of us could do if we wanted to start
a real race initiative.  Everything the president has proposed is either
phony or stupid, says TNR.  What The New Republic, understanding the true
conflicts, proposes is..... nothing! 

I call this striking because I'd really like us to be struck by how
remarkable this is, not because I think it a rare or unexpected event. 
The dearth of civic imagination, the void in leadership, the revolution of
falling expectations in public discourse are by now so advanced that to
demolish an attempt at national leadership and put absolutely nothing in
its place is utterly routine, and seems intellectually up-to-snuff to
people who are up to their ears in intellectual snuff. 

I offer these thoughts not as a critique of The New Republic, which is a
fine magazine, but as a challenge to our working group on leadership and
to the Commission as a whole.  Could we rewrite this editorial and show
what "opinion leaders" could be doing?  Can we challenge the culture of
critique to become something better and more useful to the country?  Do we
understand how things have gotten to this point, where the best and the
brightest feel fully at ease in demolition work, and see no problem when
the demolition leads nowhere? 

It seems to me that these are questions the Commission and the leadership
group could be taking up.  Your thoughts, colleagues?

Subject:      Re: leadership voids: an example

To: Leadership Subgroup
From: Amy Gutmann
Subject: Jay Rosen's excellent memo

I will be bried in reply to Jay's memo because I think Jay has found a
good example of part of the problem of contemporary political commentary
and culture. Jay has also helpfully pinpointed an important part of the
problem.  (The other part is that under the aura of journalistic
objectivity, the article mistakenly assumes and asserts--without a shred
of reliable evidence, when there exists a lot of evidence on the other
side-- that Americans are irresolvably divided and close-minded in their
views on race.  We may have no doubt that some public opinion leaders are
so divided and close-minded, but the best in-depth studies of public
opinion on race show quite the reverse, that ordinary Americans change
their minds in reaction to both leadership and moral argument. It's too
bad, and a symptom of our problem of leadership, that so many public
opinion leaders, journalists among them, project their close-mindedness on
to the American public. (For evidence that Americans are not close-minded
about our racial problems, see, e.g., Piazza and Sniderman, The Scar of
Race, pp. 131-146. For the practical and moral implications of this for
the politics of race--and the importance of leadership on race--in this
country, see Appiah and Gutmann, Color Conscious, pp. 138-151.) 

Many thanks to Jay!

Amy

"Leadership" Colleagues--

I'm glad Marty, Jay, Amy have got us started using this listserv. This is
probably going to be a haphazard means of communicating over the summer
when any sensible person would be far removed from his/her computer. But I
hope we can have some e-mail discussion to keep things rolling. 

Far from the infectious spirit of our meetings in Philadelphia where I
came to share in the sense that we could truly coax from ourselves
something new and something important, I find myself pondering 2 null
hypotheses. First, that we can't say or do anything NEW about leadership;
second, that we can't say or do anything GENERAL about leadership. 

The critical word there is "we." As I start to think about and read about
and keep my eyes open to the question of leadership, I see impresive
examples all over. I've read a bit on Ernie Cortes, who was mentioned at
our meeting. I get my Swarthmore Alumni Bulletion and read about Eugene
Lang, an imaginataive philanthropist who sponsors disadvantaged kids
through college. I read in the newspaper about the Vermont publisher of
some national auto magazine who not only provides his employees paid leave
to visit their children's schools but is now trying to make the first day
of school a state holiday so parents can meet teachers. (He says the first
day of hunting season is often recognized by Vermont employers as a
holiday, why not the first day of school?) And many, many more. I can't
clip the newspaper fast enough. So in a world where many people are
concerned about leadership and civic imagination and where there are
hundreds, thousands of impressive instances of the sort of thing that (I
think) we want to encourage, what is it that our un-elected, un- anchored
(in any particular community), un-full-time group of wonderful thinkers is
in a position to add that is new? 

Or what can we add that is general? I fear that the more generally one
talks about leadership, the more vapidly one talks about it. What are the
leadership issues in politics? in the corporations? in the Congress? in
executive agencies? in the ministry? in the schools? I've just browsed
through Mary Ann Glendon's "A Nation of Lawyers" about leadership in the
law and judiciary.  Part of the time what she seems to want from judges is
character and reasonable self-restraint -- that that's what defines ideal
judicial behavior. But she also admires Earl Warren for exercising a
different kind of leadership, a dogged effort at building consensus among
9 justices. She criticizes the current Supreme Court decisions as mere
"voting" rather than deliberating and consensus-building, and attacks with
relish the Kennnedy-Souter-O'Connor opinion in Planned Parenthood vs.
Casey for its pompousness, saying the words of judicial restraint but
forgetting the tune. 

I don't know if she's right or wrong in this, I'm just pointing out that
serious discussions about leadership might have very different
vocabularies in different contexts. Is "self-restraint" going to be a big
issue in the ministry or among high school principals as it is with the
judiciary? 

As I think about these matters, I want to urge us not to abandon too
quickly one area where "we" have notable strength: thinking and analysis.
I agree that another "report" is an outcome that makes me want to yawn
already. But some kind of writing, whatever form it might take, or
collection of writings, that help clarify issues about leadership or
dimensions of leadership in certain settings, or leading challenges to
leadership, or the changing historical context for leadership to be
exercised -- this would not seem to me beyond us and it would seem to me
potentially very helpful. 

My own inclinations usually run to the historical, and it seems to me we
have a hard time grasping especially our recent history. Think, for
instance, about models of leadership in the Congress. Who comes to mind?
Lyndon Johnson probably, maybe Speaker Rayburn, maybe, in a crucial
moment, Everett Dirksen.  Those are almost inconceivable models today in
the much more decentralized Congress of diffused power, weaker committee
chairs, a proliferation of subcommittee leadership, greater ability of
individual representatives to work through the media and other
institutions and around party structures, etc.  Newt Gingrich is an
extremely interesting example of contemporary leadership, whatever one may
think of the ends to which he has harnessed it. But whatever it means to
be a Congressional leader today, it seems clear that the constraints and
opportunities are so different from what LBJ faced in the l950s that we
require entirely new models and images of what exemplary leadership in
Congress would be. 

I think this would be true in most domains. Certainly college presidents
today exercise leadership much more in relation to external constituencies
(the government, foundations, wealthy donors) than to internal curricular
and educational matters than they needed to in the past. What models of
leadership are appropriate? Should everyone who runs a college still want
to be Robert Hutchins (should anyone want to be Robert Hutchins)? What are
the constraints and opportunities of leadership in higher education TODAY? 

A last thought. I've been skimming through some works on welfare, learning
that, in anything like its present state, welfare does not go back to l935
but to l960s, that the federal role vastly grew in the l960s, expanding
further in the early l970s, the number of people on welfare doubling from
the l970s to the early Reagan years, with concerns expressed from those
days on about a system that was breeding dependency by being badly
administered. Now, maybe Lawrence Mead (Beyond Entitlement) has the wrong
take on this and maybe he misplaces his admiration for those he calls the
"civic conservatives" in the Congress in l970s/80s efforts at welfare
reform. But it makes me think Clinton's failure to veto the welfare bill
may have been a failure of leadership for reasons different than I
thought. I thought it was a failure of nerve, a chance for a "profile in
courage" that Clinton muffed. But maybe it was a failure at explanation, a
failure to say to the left why welfare required reforming before turning
to the right to say why reform had to be humane. The "leadership" question
was not veto or no-veto, not "courage,"  but hard in-the-trenches building
of opinion and understanding. So maybe we are looking not so much for "New
Profiles in Courage" but for "New Profiles in Leadership That Will PRevent
the Need for Courage"! 

Sorry these thoughts are so random and so long. I hate really long
e-mails, like this one. Which raises one further question: how many of us
are really comfortable, regular e-mail users? And should longer
communications go by regular mail? Or should e-mails be periodically
collected by staff and sent out regular mail? 

Michael

I have been enjoying the exchange. I have lots to say on the
merits, but I am limiting this intervention simply to register my
agreement with Michael that longer emails should be sent by mail
and all emails should be periodically collected by staff and sent
out snail mail (perhaps with a cover memo identifying and/or

evolving correspondence from time to time. Otherwise, keep
