The Criminalization of Politics and its Impact on Culture

DAVID BROMWICH:  Some of what I'm going to say is familiar
in its nature; some of it will have become familiar in the last couple of
hours of discussion and in Judy Rodin's opening remarks, with which
mine overlap to a degree.  But I'll take that as a sign of coherence in
the whole proceedings, rather than redundancy on my part.
<p>
And I mean to open by just sharing a few anecdotes and observations, and
then stating four theses dogmatically in order to start a discussion.  And
to
show the ordinariness of my sources, let me start by recalling a moment
almost at random from daytime talk TV.
<p>
A young black woman, who had been beaten nearly to death by a crack
addict,
having suffered a severe concussion, multiple fractures and a face so
smashed
up it had to be wired together, was asked by a sympathetic TV hostess to
confront the man who'd done this to her.  His image was piped in by
close-circuit TV from prison.  He'd been invited by the show's producers
to
ask the woman in public to forgive him.  She wasn't sure that she could.
Her
job, as was plain, from the setup, was, anyhow, to exhibit her feelings of
grief and anger, and after meditating for 20 minutes, more or less, see
what
new point of judgment she could arrive at.
<p>
This show miscarried a bit.  The man was sullen; the woman who had been
his
victim still looked wounded and looked as if she were baffled.  On this
occasion, both participants broke with the decorum of therapeutic
atonement
that the TV format calls for.  I didn't watch the end.  I felt I was
watching
something I wasn't meant to see, but I mentioned the segment to a few
friends,
who were shocked, as I was--more so, in one way, since they didn't know
about
daytime TV.  They did not know there was a genre of shows where such
things
not only could be shown, but were encouraged and cultivated and created as
an edifying spectacle.
<p>
Many of you will have heard of another appearance on a daytime program.
This
a surprise appearance of someone billed as a secret admirer of an
unsuspecting
conventional young man, whom the producers successfully lured into a chair
on
screen with the promise that his life would be changed.  The promise was,
of
course, implicitly, sexual flattery, but the admirer turned out to be
another
young man, and the one who'd been set up was displeased.  After the show
his
displeasure turned to brooding, resentment and rage, and a few days later
he
shot his admirer.
<p>
This produced an expression of bemused regret from the TV hostess, and
there,
we might say, the story ends.  But these shows continue to be popular and
influential.  What they share and convey, most of all, is an ethos of
confrontation, the prompter of the exchange usually being an accusation of
suppressed feelings.  The moral and sensational selling point, I guess,
for
spectators is that here artificial barriers between people will be seen to
have been dramatically torn down.
<p>
Incest, a favorite topic in this walk of entertainment, allows the
producer
and star and audience to exhibit a shared understanding of the taboo, and
by
publicizing its violation, at the same time, to lend a gloss of ordinary
scandal to the exposure.  But by doing so they also bring the act within a
normal range it never seemed part of earlier.  Often a therapist or
someone
called a therapist is on the scene to supervise the interactions and
comment
on them gravely.
<p>
Now there is a paradox about the way these shows operate in the minds of
their
participants and spectators.  In expanding, and as they must suppose
deepening
domain of privacy, they reduce the conventional qualifications for public
speech below what had once been the minimum in the private realm.  The
result
is a counterfeit personal discourse that mimics the possibility of
discourse
about public things, even as it destroys genuine privacy.
<p>
This will sound sweeping, and also may be rather abstract to anyone who
hasn't
seen the shows or had the time to notice the inroads they've made in
politics
and in what we still think of as the legitimate media.
<p>
What the mood of shared intimacy means in practice became most vivid to me
on
hearing the words of a guest, who said once to the most popular of the
hostesses that though she'd never dared to tell her closest friends what
she
was about to say, the truth was that the mayhem her daughter had caused at
home was the real reason for the breakup of her marriage.  She didn't dare
say
it to her 10 best friends or to her family, either, but she was saying it
here
to 10 million.
<p>
We ought to think slowly what's being encouraged in a culture where this
kind
of entertainment is part of the common fare.  I've mentioned inroads
elsewhere.  The confession of traumatic experience has now been used with
apparent confidence of success as a way of tapping millions of votes by
leaders in both political parties.
<p>
The effect of these therapeutic dramas is to level distinctions and to
abort
authority.  The best explanation for any taboo, `We just don't do that,'
falls
on barren ground when the greatest of such rules, the one against talking
to
strangers about the things we do or things we've experienced with each
other,
gets broken at the very start of the game.  But the seductive intent here
is
carried out in the name, I think, of a rival taboo, namely the democratic
aversion from all forms of deference as a kind of snobbery.
<p>
One of the puzzles of the mass culture today is that it is obsessed with
making every part of the life it reflects more democratic.  It thinks,
though
maybe in a way that Tom Bender would view as perverse, that the cure for
the ills of democracy is more democracy as it interprets that.
<p>
It might be thought as John Stuart Mill, for example, did think in
"Representative Government," and as Tom reminded us, Lippmann extended his
thought in those books of the post-World War I period, that democracy is a
good in politics, but that to accomplish what it can there, it mustn't be
made
the prior or ascendant value of every walk of life.
<p>
The deference that goes with observing distinctions is a practice that
leadership depends on, as does all education.  The word `education'
implies a
leading-in, a teaching, among other things, by example.  But we've moved
in
our culture, generally, from an idea of the exemplary character who
addresses
an audience to the idea of the sample person from the mass who is useful
to
the audience chiefly by confronting them with thoughts or feelings or
opinions
already there.
<p>
The contemporary design of political speeches and platforms in keeping
with
the advisory pattern of focus group response has become the correlative in
politics today of the design of public therapy by audience response.  And
there's a good deal of overlapping in the kinds of demotic audience from
which
these therapeutic formats and the spectacles they contribute to shape are
drawn.
<p>
Let me now state the four theses.  Thesis one:  For anyone concerned with
the
habits of reflection and deliberation that belong to democratic
citizenship,
the mass culture of America today is the enemy.  As this culture is our
leading export, it is the enemy also of much of the good we take for
granted
in the political democracy we've worked hard to spread throughout the
world.
The evil is not new, but the incorporation and rationalization of
worldwide
media networks in the past two decades have given it a scope and influence
without parallel.
<p>
Thesis two:  Political and cultural action has come to mean a method for
satisfying needs--that is, desires imputed to people by experts in the
medium
of opinion research and preference.  Reflective feeling, by contrast, the
gradual attainment of a sense of the duties I owe to fellow citizens in
this
or that situation, has ceded to plebiscitary reaction and confessional
feeling.  Sentiment of the latter kind, that is to say this reactive
sharing
of needs that I've been describing--sentiment of the latter kind, moves
quickly, does not distinguish between private and public, and is
comfortable
identifying with people as types, rather than judging them as moral
agents.
<p>
Along with a preference for identifying with comes a pleasure--excuse me,
comes a picture of oneself as a typical member of a group that is owed
satisfaction, rather than a citizen who owes and is owed the performance
of
certain duties.  The result leads away from an understanding of shared
ideals
and toward an ethic of shared experiences--experiences from the present
and
past ideals which would be partly in the future.
<p>
Thesis three:  The most visible casualties in the regression of democratic
morale have been thus far chiefly politics, education and the law.
Politics,
in the bipartisan reliance on social scientific methods that appeal to the
prejudices people already cherish, whether ill or well-instructed.
Eduction,
in the waning of the belief that there are things that every citizen
should
know, that there is a good elitism--repeat, a good elitism in knowing more
rather than knowing less, and the growing counter-belief, entertained with
varying degrees of irony or optimism, that the scene of instruction is
fated
to be a marketplace of ideas and salable skills.  And law, in the fading
of
the conviction that the manners of citizenship are intimately affected by
the
conduct of justice, so that a juror, chosen as the statistical
representative
of a human type, projected to vote in exactly one way, can easily now feel
well within his or her rights in disclosing the contents of jury
deliberation the day after a verdict is announced.
<p>
Thesis four:  Under the impact of the mass culture these distinct areas of
American social practice have moved into closer conformity with each
other.
Educators are expected to meet, swiftly and surely, the clamor of students
for
shared experiences; political representatives to follow opinion far more
than
they lead it, and, in a pinch, to lead in the language of following; and
lawyers to seek the widest attainable publicity for a case in order to
facilitate a decision by persons of the narrowest possible knowledge.
<p>
There is, thus, a commonsense basis for the nihilism of everyday life, at
whose
bidding many Americans now regularly defeat school budgets and amend them
downward, defect from voting at election time, and fervently hope they'll
never be judged by a jury of fellow citizens.
<p>
The passage I've just made in this rapid sketch from talk television to
politics as it's now practiced may have seemed a short jump and a far
longer one, so you might guess, is required to get us from these
contemporary troubles to any substantial change in our view of education.
But
if you look into the national standards for literature, which were
rejected
last year by the federal government but have been accepted by many states,
which define literature so as to include personal narratives by students
and
don't define literacy as a precondition of literature, you'll see
prominent
among the collective authorship of the book several focus groups,
rank-and-file teachers from across the country whose approval and
disapproval
and graded reactions were called upon, as from so many turns of an
opinion-sensitive dial, to help generate the final form of the national
standards. <p>

That project was initiated and worked out from research institutes in
steering
a federal grant, but the authors felt warranted in their author--felt,
excuse
me, unwarranted in their authority unless they could safely cite this form
of reverse deference.
<p>
The effects, then, that I'm describing, I would like to say, work
both ways.  The kind of plebiscitary practice that Paul Begala talked of
work
their way down into the culture of the media, but media practices like
therapeutic TV have gone back into politics, too.
<p>
Anyway, the common feature, I take it, of the process, this blurring of
the
boundary between authority and constituency, seems related in a way that's
not
often noticed to the loss of decent self-regulation that people often
complain of in the mass media.  These manifestations of cultural default
come
together in a puzzle about what, if anything, to be embarrassed by, what
to be
ashamed of.  So in speaking about the enforceable limits on speech and
action
today, we tend to run together, into each other, concerns that are
severally
libertarian and republican and commercial:  the license to broadcast
anything
you like; the right to hear anything you like; and the always
unimpeachable
motive of indifferent moneymaking. <p>

It's sometimes said that you can't legislate shame, that our customary
small
morals of approval and disapproval are, properly speaking, beyond the
reach of
the law and, therefore, unhappily, beyond the reach of suasion.  This has
become a reflexive American way of looking at the question, but it's not
the
outcome of a satisfactory or even reasonably frank description of our
predicament. <p>

And there are, it seems to me, after all, social incentives or
discouragements
that lie between a sensorial code and the blank feeling of impotence in
the
face of the mass culture, the sense that the culture is the enemy that
many
people seem to feel now.  I think it's a feeling especially strong among
those
trying to bring up small children.
<p>
We might do several things we don't do now.  We might tax.  For example,
zoning laws already forbid certain kinds of shops or theaters from moving
into
settled neighborhoods.  And similarly, works of commerce of some
description,
such as pornographic films with a strong sadistic edge, having been
determined
to be hazardous to human health, could be made expensive to the consumer
and
swept to the illegitimated precincts to which, by nature, they belong.
<p>
Changes like that would require a shift of our present constitutional idea
that all expression properly owns the wide liberty that was designed to
protect politically suasive expression, because all expression may be
implicitly suasive.  That idea is just one instance of a kind of
literalism--the treatment of the corporations as persons for the sake of
political advertising is another--that will have to be reformed generally
if
local changes are to follow.
<p>
One might, likewise, imagine protocols of internal enforcement--I take
this
idea indirectly from Mill's last chapter in "Representative
Government"--of internal enforcement coming to govern the mass circulation
media in a matter akin to that of civil service exams.  Whereby a young
reporter, aspiring to write on politics, would have to prove himself or
herself in possession of a certain body of political and historical
knowledge
before being assigned a story of much responsibility and weight.
<p>
And maybe there's a more obvious remedy, too, against the libertinism of
publicity, in the shape of public opinion itself.  And I suppose I mean,
here, to revise Tom Bender's revision of the Madisonian line--you know,
the
republican cure for the ills most incident to a republic, and go back from
democracy cures the ills of democracy--to Madison's original emphasis,
though
I don't claim to have ultimate and original materials.
<p>
How could public opinion reshape the libertinism of publicity?  Well, why
should we respect the current plutocratic convention by which the
producers of slanderous or degrading materials in politics and
journalism and in the arts are screened from contempt by the enormous
anonymity of power?  Let them--the producers--let them be named as if they
and
not their agents and anchormen and advance women were the real movers in
the
scene, and let their families and neighbors of their families have this
familiar knowledge to reflect on again and again when they think how that
money was made.
<p>
If we're going to induce a new idea of civic attention, and work in
earnest
toward the reflective wisdom that may come with it, we shall have to
revive
some part of an older habit of being shockable and being ready to say that
we
are.  Thanks.
