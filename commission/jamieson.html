How Bad Is It Really?  Lessons From Media Research <p>
Presentation by Professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson

</center>
<p>

<p>
 JUDITH RODIN : Let me say good morning and welcome back.
Yesterday we spent a considerable amount of time exploring new ideas and
sharing our perceptions about a variety of issues--incivility and
intolerance,
a bit in the morning, and then we enlarged and expanded the conversation
to
community and group process and empowerment and a variety of other issues
that
I think nicely rounds out some of the issues that we are discussing.
<p>
What we'll try to accomplish today is the following:  We have several
speakers, beginning with Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who will discuss with us
politics, the media, rhetoric.  And Kathleen told me that she rewrote her
comments after yesterday's conversations so that she would add to and
enhance
the discussion that we had already begun.
<p>
We will move from that to two panel sessions, one that really more
intensely
analyzes the causes, and that will move us forward in our deliberations,
and
then a second that more intensively analyzes some models for solutions.
They
will move us closer, I think, to the kind of agenda-setting that many of
us
envision must come out of the discussions today.  I'll conclude this
afternoon
with a conversation with you that really does attempt to both summarize,
set
some aspects of the agenda, and then ask you to work with me to set other
aspects of the agenda.
<p>
So it's my intention that we will leave here this afternoon with our
agenda,
if not fully set, at least with some fairly substantive conclusions about
where we're going, the kinds of directions that we'll be taking and the
kinds
of issues that we'll be working through.  A more elaborated summary of our
conversation will follow, from our transcribing the notes, and we will
send
those to you.  But I don't think it's especially fruitful  for me
to play a summative role.  We've all participated in the same
conversation,
and so we'll just use our time this afternoon to really move ourselves
forward
and set our agenda.
<p>
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, our first speaker this morning, is certainly
familiar
to many of you.  She is familiar on the media, particularly around
election
time.  She's a noted commentator on political rhetoric and on the
relationships between media, politics and the public.  Here at Penn, we
know
Kathleen also as the Dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and
one of
my most energetic and stimulating colleagues.
<p>
Her notable books include, "Dirty Politics:  Deception, Distraction and
Democracy," "Packaging the Presidency:  A History in Criticism of
Presidential
Advertising," "Presidential Debates:  The Challenge of Creating an
Informed
Electorate," and "Eloquence in an Electronic Age."  And I know that there
are
more on the way.  Kathleen.
<p>
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON:  I'd like to build on a question that David asked
yesterday, which I would paraphrase to be:  At what point do we express
outrage, at what point to express shame?  Are there things that shock us
and
when do we speak about them?
<p>
And I would like to show you three instances in which the public or the
press
or the pundit community or the academic community or some combination
managed
to express a sense that the discourse was inappropriate.  And I want to do
that in part to answer David's question, to suggest that there are
instances
of that in a market economy, and that those instances are instructive if
we're trying to ask:  Where are the current boundaries?
<p>
And so in that context, I'd like to play the first tape.
<p>
(From tape) <p>

Announcer #1:  He told us he would lead.  He told us he could do his job
and
run for president; that he was a doer, not a talker.  Then he told us he
was
quitting, giving up, leaving behind the gridlock he helped create.  And
now
all he offers are negative attacks.  Meanwhile, the real work goes
on--balancing the budget, protecting Medicare, education, the environment,
reforming welfare, cracking down on violent crime by a leader who's proven
actions speak louder than words.
<p>
Announcer #2:  Bill Clinton--he's really something.  He's now trying to
avoid
a sexual harassment lawsuit, claiming he's on active military duty.
Active
duty?  Newspapers report that Mr. Clinton claims, as commander in chief,
he's
covered under the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act of 1940, which grants
automatic delays in lawsuits against military personnel until their active
duty is over.  Active duty?  Bill Clinton--he's really something.
<p>

insurance...
<p>
(End of tape) <p>

JAMIESON:  Stop, thank you.  Cut the tape. <p>

The first ad was on the air in late May, 1996, and caused a very strong
response by the editorial community, by academics and by those who comment
about politics.  The ad has this as its context:  Senator Dole had
resigned
from the Senate in order to campaign full-time for president of the United
States.  Bill Clinton, as president, had written him a gracious letter
which
thanked him for his distinguished service to the United States.
<p>
Bill Clinton's ad team then turns around and puts an ad on the air that
suggests that he's a quitter who's walked away from the gridlock he helped
create; in other words, the paid media are now serving to carry the attack
message, an environment in which the president has acted in a dramatically
different fashion.  The name for this, I assume, is hypocrisy.
<p>
The underlying assumption that Dole had quit was one that many found
offensive, since he had resigned, and the notion that he'd walked away
from
the gridlock he had helped create was problematic because you wouldn't
have
gridlock if you didn't have a Democrat in the White House.  And so the
people who are the custodians, in my judgment the first-line
custodians of civil discourse responded to this and they are doing it,
having been identified as the liberal media by Bob Dole--responded by
saying
that this was inappropriate, that the ad ought to be taken off the air.
And to the surprise of many people, it was.
<p>
Meantime, before it was taken off the air, Clinton was seeing placards in
the
audiences to which he was speaking, probably put there by the Dole
Campaign,
saying Bob Dole is not a quitter, and he was hearing on the stump from
people
who may or may not have been planted by the other campaign, saying that
that
was inappropriate discourse. <p>

At the same time the Republicans previewed the second ad.  They showed the
ad
at a press conference; they bought time to air the ad.  The ad is
attempting
to extend, in the news context, the interaction that is happening that
week
between Clinton's lawyers and the court and Paula Jones over the sexual
harassment lawsuit.  And Bill Clinton's lawyer had argued that Clinton
ought
to be able to delay accountability until after he stepped down as
president, a
case that's going to be decided, I gather, shortly.  And he ought to be
able
to do that because he's commander in chief; hence, on active military
duty.
<p>
This ad is an attempt to ensure that that stays in the news longer than it
otherwise would stay, but in the process it takes a series of photos of
Clinton in recreational context and invites the inference that not only is
he
not the commander in chief, but that he doesn't take the job seriously.
The
same group of individuals who were reacting very negatively to the first
ad
responded to the press conference by saying that this, too, was
inappropriate
discourse.  Having purchased time, the Republicans never aired the ad.
<p>
This is an instance in which the intellectual community that functions as
the
front guard expressed sufficient outrage that, in one case, an ad was
pulled
and, in another case, the effect of the ad would have been sufficiently
controversial that the ad didn't air at all.  Second instance, if you'll
play
the tape.
<p>
(From tape)
<p>
Announcer #3:  Bush and Dukakis on crime:  Bush supports the death penalty
for
first-degree murderers; Dukakis not only opposes the death penalty, he
allowed
first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison.  One was Willie
Horton, who murdered a boy in a robbery, stabbing him 19 times.  Despite a
life sentence, Horton received 10 weekend passes from prison.  Horton
fled,
kidnapped a young couple, stabbing the man and repeatedly raping his
girlfriend.  Weekend prison passes; Dukakis on crime.
<p>
(End of tape)
<p>
JAMIESON:  This is, as you know, from the 1988 campaign, and this is an
interesting instance because it aired for a four-week period on cable and,
hence, was not seen in large portions of the United States and not seen by
many people who don't watch cable, even though they have it in their
homes.
But the ad itself did not provoke immediate controversy, and when the
Democrats tried to make it controversial, it didn't stick, in part, I
think,
because those who were trying to find it controversial appeared to be
speaking
from a partisan perspective and, hence, were discredited in an environment
which we assume that partisans are always partisan, and a partisan cannot
make
a non-partisan point.
<p>
However, after the election was over, the pundit community--the
columnists,
the editorial writers, the academic community--spent a great deal of time
thinking about and worrying about what that ad and its possible effect had
meant and added, as a consequence of this discussion, a new word to our
vocabulary:  Hortonize. <p>

George Bush was sufficiently constrained in 1992 by the fear that if he
aired
attack ads or if he addressed an ad using race as a subtext or text, that
he
would be branded as a Hortonizer and, hence, repeating the dirty tricks
and
the dirty advertising of 1988, advertising that was not perceived in '88
itself to have been dirty; that his campaign staff and strategists
indicated
to us in the election debriefings that they did not air ads they otherwise
would have aired for fear of the condemnation that would have followed
from
that perception.
<p>
This is an interesting instance because what it suggests is that we may,
in
fact, not have an immediate visceral response to some things that on
second
reflection we find problematic; that it occasionally takes time to find
the
articulated structure through which we will perceive this kind of
discourse
and ultimately to create a frame that makes it less likely to occur.
<p>
Interestingly, after the Horton episode in the 1988 campaign, we have not
had
serious instances in national presidential campaigns, in which you have
had
this sort of use of race and discourse, in large part, I believe, because
we
have the label Hortonizing, and because it so clearly telegraphs the
inappropriate, that there is great fear that if one steps into that
boundary,
one is going to be tarred with the label and, hence, one is going to be
hurt.
<p>
Third instance.
<p>
(From tape)
<p>
Mr. DON IMUS:  ...in those tank tops.  Maybe I'll just hang on to these.
Oh,
here we go.  Good evening, Mr. President, Mrs. Clinton, honored guests,
ladies and gentlemen, radio and TV scum.
<p>
You know, I--I think it would be fair to say that back when the Clintons
took
office, if we had placed them all in a lineup--well, not a lineup--if we
were
to have speculated on which member of the first family would be the first
to
be indicted--I don't mean indicted, I--I meant to receive a
subpoena--everybody in this room would have picked Roger.  I mean, been
there,
done that.
<p>
Well, in the past three years, Socks the cat has been in more jams than
Roger.
Roger has been a saint.  The cat has peed on national treasures.  Roger
hasn't.  Socks has thrown up hairballs.  Roger hasn't.  Socks got his
girlfriend pregnant and had--oh, no, that was Roger.  And--and as you
know,
nearly every incident in the lives of the first family has been made worse
by
each and every person in this room--the radio and television
correspondents--even innocuous incidents.
<p>
For example, when Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive game record,
the
president was at Camden Yards, doing play-by-play on the radio with John
Miller.  Bobby Bonilla hit a double and we all heard the president, in his
obvious excitement, holler, `Go, baby.'  And I remember commenting at the
time, `I bet that's not the first time he's said that.'  Remember the
AstroTurf in the pickup?  And my point is there is an innocent event made
sinister by some creep in the media, although, in some cases, the Clintons
have not exactly helped themselves.
<p>
Imagine if back in 1978 Mrs. Clinton had not said to Mr. Clinton, `Honey,
Jim
and Susan are here, and they've got some riverfront land for these great
vacation homes, and maybe we can make some serious money,' and he said,
`God,
I love this Reaganomics.'  Or later, she said, `Bill, I talked to Webb,
and he
said put down 600 hours,' and he said, `Wow, that's a lot.'  She said,
`Yes, I
think 60 makes more sense.' And recently, somebody said, `I don't know, I
left
them on the table in the book room.'
<p>
Which reminds me, in light of the controversy that surrounded the
publication
of Mrs. Clinton's book, perhaps Anonymous should have written "It Takes a
Village."  And then there's Senator D'Amato's book, "It Takes a Village
Idiot."  The senator suggests that the Clintons hung around with unsavory
characters in Little Rock.  What the hell is he talking about?  All of his
friends have bodies in the trunks of their cars.
<p>
By the way, my candidate for "Primary Colors" is Susan Thomases, the
literary
agent.  I think she wrote it and simply can't remember.  When I was asked
to
speak here tonight and was told who would be in attendance, my initial
thought
was, `Well, I've already said almost every awful thing you could say about
almost everyone in the room.'  And then I thought, `Well, almost
everything.'
And I--I recognize I'm not going to be invited to Renaissance Weekend, or
that
Bohemian deal where Newt, Rush and Dick all sit in a tepee, naked, beating
on
tom-toms.  I won't be having lunch with Peter Jennings and some Hollywood
nitwit, so this could actually be fun.
<p>
Well, let's start at the bottom with you folks in the media and work our
way
up.  Do you remember the infamous curbside shooting photograph from the
Vietnam War?  Well, I'm watching the "CBS Evening News" one night, with
Dan
Rather and Connie Chung--things are not going well--and I'm thinking,
`We're a
couple of nights away from another hideous photograph.'  I mean, everybody
in
this room knows Dan Rather is capable of anything, including pulling a gun
out
on the set of the "CBS Evening News." <p>

Dan has these--Dan has these utterly incomprehensible bucolic expressions
that
he punctuates conversations with.  Several times, after talking with him,
he
would say to me, `Tamp them up solid,' having something to do, I later
learned, with fortifying the sides of underground tunnels that his father
dug
for reasons that remain unclear.  Now I'm hard of
hearing--hear--hearing-impaired, I guess, would be better, from wearing
headphones for a long time, so I--I thought he was saying, `Tampons are
solid,' and I'm thinking, `Why--why would he say that?  I mean, I know
he's
nuts, but what does that mean?'
<p>
Anyway, I would laugh and I would say `Uh-huh,' and I would--I would hang
up.
Now he's a great reporter, but he does not have all of his bait in the
water.
And he's a little tense--I mean, watching Dan Rather do the news, he looks
like he's making a hostage tape.  They should have guys in ski masks, you
know, and AK-47s just stand off and--and yet he is one of the three or
four
people most Americans get their news from.
<p>
(End of tape)
<p>
JAMIESON:  I think that is an extraordinarily instructive evening because
you see a point at which the audience boos the person who is the
presenter,
and you ask why it happened then and hadn't happened earlier.  Why did it
take that series of potentially problematic statements before the audience
was ready to respond in a fashion which would express disapproval?  And
you hear the audience then, as the tape progresses, begin to divide.
There are moments in which parts of the audience respond and parts of the
audience don't respond.
<p>
I think what we have is a moment in which we are examining what
constitutes appropriate discourse in a setting in which we didn't expect
to
see this kind of discourse occur.  What is most interesting to me about
this
encounter is that Imus is correct when he says that he's insulted all of
these
people before.  In fact, he's insulted them before in this same language.
In
fact, they've appeared on his show and been insulted on his show, and
they've
appeared on his show before and after he's insulted them.
<p>
So the question isn't:  Are they tolerant of that kind of language when
transmitted over radio to a massed audience?  And Imus has a very large
audience.  But, rather, in what environment is that
considered by them to be inappropriate discourse?  And situational
constraints
here are clearly, markedly different.  The speaker of the House has spoken
as
part of the set of speeches before Imus.  Walter Cronkite has spoken.  And
you may not profane the speaker of the House, but profaning Walter
Cronkite is
taken relatively seriously in this culture. <p>

Bill Clinton has spoken as president of the United States.  Hillary
Clinton is
there as the first lady.  The individuals in that room are dressed for a
formal occasion and the boundaries, as a result, I think, have changed
dramatically.  I think what is instructive here is that we  become aware
that there are some kinds of things that we tag as situationally
inappropriate and uncivil and over the line when we don't in other
circumstances which are also mass-mediated circumstances.
<p>
For a practical purpose, there is not much difference in
listening to Imus saying this on the radio and listening to this tape
play.
There's a difference when you see it in the context of the setting of that
dinner.  And it is a very different kind of experience when you see the
president of the United States, the speaker of the House, the first lady
and
the journalists who are being discussed in the audience as part of the
frame
of response for the discourse that is being offered.
<p>
As you know, the people who are in the audience, to an individual,
condemned
this discourse and the question was raised to them:
Well, then, why did you appear on the show?  `Why are you continuing to
appear
on the show?' is a question we might ask after the fact, because, in fact,
the
individuals who condemned it have continued to appear on Imus' show.  I
think
it raises the question about the circumstances in which we respond and how
we
respond, and suggests that we don't have a single definition that moves
across
circumstances. <p>

I think the other thing that is potentially important about this is the
effort
by the White House to ensure that it wasn't shown.  Mike McCurry asked
that
they not show this on television.  And C-SPAN responded by saying they
taped
it, and as a result, they were going to show it on television.  When we
make institutional
moves to try to suppress something, I think we're telling ourselves
something 
about the way in which the society is functioning in relationship to the
discourse.
<p>
I think McCurry, in fact, was doing something that was necessary under the
circumstance in order to indicate that from the White House's perspective,
it
was inappropriate discourse, although I suspect that he was very pleased
to
see it air because it recontextualizes all of these claims being made
about
Bill Clinton in an environment in which, because you can dismiss a set of
them
as being vulgar and inappropriate, you can, as a result, also, you know,
set
aside those that look a lot like morning news reports about Clinton's
activities.
<p>
We have a fourth domain in which there's been a lot of controversy about
incivility, and that is talk radio.  And what I would like to indicate to
you
is that in talk radio, many of the things that are talked about in public
as
incivility are atypical, but let me first indicate to you what they are.
Here
are the things that are most often quoted from talk radio:  Bob Grant
calling
blacks savages; Bob Grant calling LA rioters savages and blacks
genetically
inferior; Bob Grant calling Martin Luther King a scumbag, a bum, a fake, a
phony and a fraud; Bob Grant saying that Haitian boat refugees should be
allowed to drown; Bob Grant calling New York City Mayor Dinkins the
washroom
attendant; Bob Grant calling Congressman Charles Rangel a pygmy.
<p>
About G. Gordon Liddy:  G. Gordon Liddy talking about shooting federal law
enforcement officers; G. Gordon Liddy advising head shots to ATF agents
and
saying, `Kill the SOBs'; G. Gordon Liddy noting that he had
practiced using stick figures of Bill and Hillary Clinton for target
practice.
<p>
About Rush Limbaugh:  calling feminists femi-Nazis; inaccurately making
statements on air, including lying on air; assaulting the Clinton
health-care
initiative in a way allegedly designed to terrify people about health care
and
making nasty comments about the poor and people with AIDS.
<p>
I know that these are the statements that are most often repeated in the
media
because we looked at 25,000 articles about talk radio over a 10-year
period,
and we asked `What are the recurrent statements made about talk radio?'
From
these instances, which are the repeated instances about talk radio,
reporters
have drawn the inference that talk radio as a medium
is chronically uncivil and is dangerous and is potentially, as a result,
something that we ought to cordon off and worry about in a democracy.
<p>
But I want to suggest, based on the content analysis of 50 talk shows
across a
three-day period in the primaries of 1996 and over 2,000 hours of Rush
Limbaugh, is that the norm in these shows is not in any way parallel to
these
instances.  Although these instances clearly did occur, they are not
typical
even of the hosts about whom--or to whom they are attributed.  We spent a
great deal of time listening to Bob Grant on the assumption that since we
found the greatest number of instances from Bob Grant, he would be the
easiest
person to find instances that were uncivil.  And we did not find any in
over
40 hours of listening to Bob Grant.


<p>
So what we have is an interesting instance in which the amount of public
alarm about incivility has been magnified dramatically by nine or 10
instances that have occurred over a 10-year period that are atypical even
of
the hosts who are offering this kind of discourse.  And I don't mean to
suggest that I think that suggesting that people kill ATF agents is
appropriate discourse, but rather that if we're going to suggest that a
medium
is dangerous and pernicious, we probably should do it based on an analysis
of
what is typical there, not what is unusual there.
<p>
But when these sorts of things occur, what happens on talk radio?  I'd
like to
answer David's question by saying at least some of the time the market
forces
that we worry about come into play in order to restrain that type of
discourse.  And I'd like to cite a series of instances from talk radio to
suggest to you that, in fact, there are social mechanisms--and they are
somewhat predictable--that work in the presence of things that we find
offensive in order to push the discourse back into its box.
<p>
So, for example, when Colorado Springs talk show host Don Baker urged
listeners to take their guns to Washington to protest the assault weapons
ban,
Francisco Duran of Colorado Springs did just that and he was arrested for
shooting at the White House.  Callers blamed Baker.  He withdrew from the
air
for a time as a result.  The incident prompted his station, KVOR, to set
up a
formal policy against advocating violence or retribution.
<p>
Now you might say:  Why was a policy needed to begin with?  Well, you
don't
assume you need a policy until you get this kind of instance, but you have
a
response to it that tries to bracket and constrain future discourse of
that sort.  After the Oklahoma bombing, which is when those statements
by G. Gordon Liddy were featured, a number of stations around the country
take Liddy off the air.  The callers from those stations, in a number of
instances, call in to say, `We find it offensive that you don't think that
we're mature enough to hear G. Gordon Liddy when he's being outrageous.
We
didn't take him seriously and we think that that sort of speech should
be able to be aired.'
<p>
However, after those instances, when G. Gordon Liddy lost nine stations,
we
can find no instances in which G. Gordon Liddy has advocated violence
against
anybody.  G. Gordon Liddy, in other words, presumably got the message from
the
market, which is, `You may be taken off the air.  Callers will respond
negatively.'
<p>
In February 1995, San Francisco's KSFO fired J. Paul Emerson after six
weeks.
His attacks on gays and his suggestion that AIDS patients be quarantined
had
produced protests and a boycott of his advertisers--classic market
reaction.
<p>
Atlanta's Shawn Hanaday responded to a discussion of the gay lifestyle of
Representative Barney Frank by telling listeners that he lost his first
radio
position for criticizing a lesbian over artificial insemination pregnancy.
He
then adds on air, `It's unnatural and I still believe that, but the bottom
line is I just think we ought to leave people alone, and I don't think
conservatives ought to be coming on the radio and making statements that,
well, if you're gay and lesbian, you can't be in Congress.  This is
America.'
<p>
This is someone who's learned the same lesson that G. Gordon Liddy has
learned
by virtue of a market response.  He was fired from a job in which he
overstepped the line in the judgment of the people who were paying his
salary.
`I still want to ride that razor's edge,' Hanaday tells an interviewer, `I
want to be outrageous.  I want to catch people and get them to listen, but
there are certain lines I won't cross.'
<p>
In March '96, Alan Dershowitz's Sunday evening show on WABC was canceled
when
he called Bob Grant a racist and a despicable talk show host.  But Grant,
too,
was fired by WABC for expressing regret that Commerce Secretary Ron Brown
may
have survived a plane crash.  After reports of the crash of Secretary of
Commerce
Ron Brown's plane in Croatia, Grant had said, `My hunch is that he's the
one
survivor.  I just have that hunch.  Maybe it's because, at heart, I'm a
pessimist.'
<p>
Although Grant was hired by WOR within two weeks of his dismissal, he
suggested that the action had sobered him, quote, "To be blunt about it, I
guess all of us talk show hosts shouldn't only want other people to listen
to
us.  We also should listen to ourselves.  I don't want the WOR management
to
ever feel they have to defend anything I say.  I don't intend that that
should
happen." <p>

On April 11th, 1996, simulcast with Spokane's Richard Clear, Seattle host
Mike
Siegal of KVI, in the words of Tal Daley, recounted the allegations that
Mayor
Norm Rice, mayor of Seattle, was shot by his wife while he was engaged in
homosexual activity.  Siegal said the story was being repeated by people
in
very high places, and that he had been hearing the story privately from
people
who will not talk publicly about it.  Because it's such a rampant rumor,
Siegal urged Rice to confront it and deny it.
<p>
On May 13th, Rice held a press conference condemning Siegal and KVI for
spreading vicious lies.  KVI aired the press conference.  Siegal appeared
on a
subsequent KVI program and apologized to the mayor, and on his own program
on
May 14th, Siegal apologized to the mayor and his family.  Siegal's callers
debated whether he should have apologized.  Some called for his
resignation.
One asked, `Do you feel any need to apologize?  You demand a lot of
accountability from other people; what kind of accountability do you
demand
for yourself?'  This is, in my judgment, a debate about the boundaries of
discourse in a civil society.
<p>
In late May, Fisher Broadcasting, owners of KVI, having listened through
this
set of exchanges about the appropriate norms for discourse, announced that
Siegal had been fired.  The statement said, `Our decision was based on an
investigation of the impact of Mike's actions on the reputation and
credibility of Fisher Broadcasting, not on the allegations surrounding the
Mayor Rice broadcast on the Mike Siegal show.  Although Mike's actions
initially impacted only KVI radio, it has now become a companywide issue,
damaging the reputation of both KVI and Fisher Broadcasting.  In seeking a
resolution to this matter, we focused on the values and commitments that
shape
our day-to-day programming standards.  We remain committed to talk radio
and
to those who support the standards our community has come to expect from
us.'
<p>
Those are all instances in which the stations took some action as a result
of
the presumption that their reputation was being tarnished or their
interest in
pursuing their commercial goals were being minimized by virtue of
discourse
that they considered inappropriate.  We also have a number of instances in
which sponsors representing constituent groups were mobilized against what
they considered to be inappropriate discourse.  After Hispanic groups
threatened a boycott of the sponsors of his program, Howard Stern
apologized
on air in Spanish for ridiculing slain Hispanic speaker Selena.  Stern had
played the sounds of gunshots over one of her songs.
<p>
Then we have instances of immediate self-correction.  After calling Judge
Lance Ito `little' and mocking him in a Japanese accent on Don Imus' radio
show, Senator Alfonse D'Amato apologizes to the Japanese community.  When,
in
a radio interview, Representative Dick Armey refers to Representative
Barney
Frank, who is gay, as Barney Fag, he apologizes, calling it an
unintentional
mispronunciation.  The comment and apology are widely reported in print
and
broadcast media.
<p>
Rush Limbaugh, too, has abandoned a number of tasteless tactics.  For a
time,
he placed a condom over his microphone to engage the audience in safe
talk,
and cued a tape sound of a vacuum cleaner to abort callers whose positions
he
found repugnant.  They were cut from the air to the sounds of a vacuum
cleaner
and a scream.  After protests, he no longer does either of those.  In his
early programs, Limbaugh included an AIDS update, whose theme song was,
"I'll
Never Love This Way Again."  Under protest from AIDS activists, he stopped
airing the segment.  `It's the single-most regretful thing I've ever done
because it ended up making fun of people who were dying.'  Limbaugh's
quoted
saying, "It was a totally irresponsible thing to do."  His imitation of
Benjamin Hooks also drew protests.  Limbaugh's Hooks sounded like
Amos and Andy's Kingfish.  That, too, has been set aside.
<p>
Talk radio, as a phenomenon, potentially is an open mike to the kinds of
verbal activities that ordinarily we find in bars and in private settings.
As
they move into a public domain, I think what we're seeing is a dialogue
when
they are problematic often followed by some action, which suggests that
the
community thinks that that oversteps, followed by moves by the talk show
hosts
to come back within the boundaries that are considered acceptable in a
commercial environment in which market forces do, in fact, act to
mainstream
discourse.
<p>
Now that tendency may, in fact, be very damaging in many parts of society
because it may minimize the voices that are able to come through; it may
suppress ideologies that would enrich the public dialogue; it may silence
points of view that, if known by the public, would lead to radical
systemic
change.  But in this instance, that same tendency is also working to
counter
some forces that I think many people would define as uncivil.  And so my
answer to David's question is I think we're in the process of trying to
determine what the boundaries are in a medium that is being used
differently,
and I think it is instructive to look at how society is functioning in
that
domain.  But I think the tendencies are relatively clear across the last
five
years.
<p>
Why, then, when you read mainstream media do you think that the typical
discourse in talk radio is uncivil?  I've enumerated for you every
instance
that I know of.  I've almost exhausted my categories.  The reason that I
think
we think that is because the mainstream media, threatened by a new medium
which is potentially providing an alternative form of expression for the
electorate, is responding predictably, which is by trying to set the
medium off as an inappropriate part of the social dialogue.  The
mainstream
media take on talk radio is that it's pernicious and that its effect is
going to be a negative effect socially.
<p>
Why would the mainstream media adopt that tactic?  They would adopt it in
part
because that would marginalize talk radio, but there's a second reason:
There's, in fact, a tendency underlying mainstream media that is evidenced
in
the way in which talk radio is covered on mainstream media, and that is a
tendency to magnify our sense of how much incivility there is out there,
how
much negativity there is out there, how much conflict there is out there,
and
then mainstream media turn around and indict the rise of incivility, the
rise
of negativity and the increasing conflict in society.
<p>
There is the possibility that incivility has not dramatically risen, but
rather that our news norms have led us to believe that it has risen, and
in
the absence of direct contact with those things that are being reported,
we've
concluded that there's a crisis when, in fact, all we have is a normal
transition in Congress where people who, once out of power, have now come
into
power and have to learn the rules in a Congress in which many of them had
no
legislative experience, which was an aberration.  Many more who are coming
into this Congress have had legislative experience.
<p>
And that secondly, talk radio is working out the kinks that occur
early in a new medium's attempt to find its social boundaries.
<p>
What I heard in the discussion yesterday, I think, were a series of claims
about what civil discourse looks like, and I'd like to precis them for
you.
What I heard us saying in general was that civil discourse gives reasons;
that
civil discourse focuses on understanding, not insulting; on resolution,
not
winning; that it invites additional communication; that it's inclusive,
tolerant, it doesn't silence voices and that it is empowering.  Let's, for
a
moment, just assume that that's our operating definition.
<p>
What are contemporary news norms?  Contemporary news norms privilege
assertion, not argument, which means that you're not going to have
reason-giving as part of what comes through the mainstream media; you're
going
to have the conclusory assertion.  It focuses on conflict, not consensus
or
compromise.  It focuses on attack, not advocacy; it exposes self-interest
of
all parties; and it focuses on who is winning and how, not on whether they
ought to win.  It focuses not on problems and the alternative solutions,
but
the tactics that are being offered by individuals to advance their own
point
of view with the presumed conclusion that they advance those views because
there's tactical advantage to them, strategic advantage to them, and that
that's the way they're going to preserve their own power base.
<p>
In other words, if these are, in fact, contemporary news norms, they are
going
to dictate that what we see in the public arena, filtered through news, is
going to look more negative, more hyperbolic, less likely to advocate or
compare, and more likely to attack than the discourse itself actually was.
That is, in fact, what's happened with talk radio.  Legitimate instances
in
which hosts have overstepped the line are featured as if they are typical.
Now it's important that they by featured because by featuring them, you
call
into play the social forces that will determine whether or not this is
discourse the society wants to accept.  But when they're featured as being
typical, they may also lead us to the conclusion that something is
happening
as the norm when, in fact, it is not happening.
<p>
We see this most clearly when we look at political discourse.  There's a
cliche in politics--in political news coverage, which says that campaigns
are
getting more negative.  I don't like the word negative because it
conflates
two very different meanings.  It conflates legitimate differentiation with
with illegitimate differentiation or with dirty politics.  If we move, in
politics, to eliminate all differentiation by saying that everything
[that] is
negative is bad, I'm not going to know how you differ from my position
because every time I point out the difference, someone is going to say,
negative, dirty, and we're going to move to dispatch that kind of
discourse.
<p>
And so we try to make a distinction in our research that assumes that
there
are different ways of approaching any given position as a politician.  You
can
attack the opponent, you can advocate your position, or you can do some
combination, which is generally a comparative move, and that in any of
those
you can be telling the truth or you can be lying or you can be misleading.
In
any of those, you can be enhancing the dialogue or you can be diminishing
the
dialogue.  So with that coding structure, one of the questions that we've
asked is:  What proportion of candidates' speeches on the stump in general
elections and the presidency across five periods in history have attacked,
just simply made the case against, no case for; have advocated--just made
the
case for me, but not against my opponent; and have done both
simultaneously?
<p>
And we find something that I think you will conclude is a surprise.  We
find
that most speeches, most of the time, engage in advocacy, and when they're
not
engaging in advocacy, most speeches, most of the time, are engaging in
comparison.  Attack is not, in fact, a dominant form in political stump
speeches by candidates.  Now why do I say I think you'll find that
surprising?
Because unless you're reading and watching those speeches, and few of us
are,
you're getting your sense of those speeches by looking at news, which
minimizes your perception of the amount of comparison--this is 1988, 1992
and
1996--all of the general election campaign speeches, compared to all of
the
broadcast network news.  You'll think that what the candidates are most
likely
to do in their speeches most of the time is attack, and in presidential
debates, you see the same thing.
<p>
So if debate viewership is down substantially, as it is this year, and if
your
exposure to it is through quick assessment of what the media environment
is
suggesting, what you would think is that you had highly attack-driven
debates,
when, in fact, we didn't, we haven't.  It is just simply not the norm in
political discourse. <p>

As a general rule, when a candidate speaks in any form--in an ad, in a
debate,
in a speech, the amount of advocacy is going to be predominant, and the
amount
of attack is going to be minimized.  And that has been historically
true, at least since 1960.  So what we have is an environment in
which the news media suggest that the discourse is more highly negative
than
it is.  There's a second tendency in the discourse, and that is to take
from
the environment not simply the attack, but to denude the attack of its
evidence, to take the reason-giving away from the attack.
<p>
And what that does is transforms indictment, a statement against the
opponent
with evidence, to simply an attack, no evidence.  And then, through the
norms
of editing, having taken the evidence out, the norm of news is to lay up
the
attacks sequentially, which suggests that a candidate simply got up and
gave
you a whole series of assertions without argument, without reasons for why
you
should oppose the other side--no reasons for why you should vote for him,
although that is what he will have done most in his speech.  In other
words,
the modeling of discourse in mainstream news is a model that removes from
the
equation of discourse something which many in this room think is a
presupposition of civility.
<p>
Then there's a second characteristic:  As the news media scan what is
available to be quoted, there is a tendency to take the most hyperbolic
statement, the most extreme statement and to suggest that it's the norm.
That's what we're seeing in the talk radio coverage.  But more
importantly,
we're seeing it in public policy debates.  We spent a year examining the
health-care reform debate, and in that process, collected all of the
speeches, all of the print and broadcast news, all of the talk radio that
we
could get our hands on and all of the advertising.  We looked at all of
the
legislation; we looked at all seven bills that were pending before
Congress.
And we asked `Why is it that most people were unaware that there [were]
six bills
other than the Clinton plan?'  And the answer is the Clinton plan was set
as a
plan that was going to be discussed, and the news frame then looked at all
the
reasons to oppose it.
<p>
And so the people who were arguing against the Clinton plan were not given
the
opportunity and news space to indicate what they stood for.  They were
simply
given space to indicate that they opposed the Clinton plan.  We then
looked at
what they said in their speeches on both sides, both the Clinton advocates
and
those who were supposedly opposing the Clinton plan--supposedly without a
plan
of their own--and what we found was that the crazier the statement, the
more
likely that it was to be quoted--that the rule that predicted what was
going to be quoted was the most hyperbolic, most dichotomous, most
Manichean
statement was going to be quoted. <p>

And if there was any name-calling in the statement, the likelihood that it
was
going to be quoted went up dramatically.  The only thing that overrode
that
prediction was if the statement was funny.  A funny statement could, in
fact,
be included.  What we saw, in other words, was a reporting structure that
magnified your perception of how negative the debate was, minimized the
likelihood that you saw that there were alternatives and magnified the
likelihood that you thought that most people most of the time stood up and
engaged in a hyperbolic rant against the other side, without ever
advocating a
position on their own. <p>

Ultimately, what does that do to the electorate?  What that does to the
electorate is gives the electorate the sense that a bunch of clowns are
engaged in legislation, without serious intent, without serious
alternatives.
<p>
I'd like to make a final point before closing.  The underlying structure
through which all of this is filtered is a strategy structure.  It's a
structure that assumes that those who come into public policy do not come
in
with goodwill and integrity, differing philosophically from the people on
the
other side, but rather that they come in because they're motivated by
personal
gain, and that personal interest and self-interest cannot be consistent
with
the public interest.  And so based on self-interest, what they do is use
tactics in order to accomplish partisan ends that are not in the public
interest.
<p>
If you set up a structure which explains public policy that way, you make
it
impossible to govern, because no goal that is being sought is ever going
to be
featured as a common goal, because the stress on conflict is going to
minimize
that, and all players are going to be discredited as venal, self-partisan,
self-interested individuals.
<p>
We took the strategy structure, which is the norm in political campaigns,
and
increasingly, the norm in public policy debates, accounting for up to
two-thirds of the broadcast and print coverage, and we exposed voters to
it in
two different studies, health-care reform and a simulated study of the
mayoral
election of 1993 in Philadelphia.  I won't bore you with the details of
the
studies; the conclusion:  People who were exposed to the strategy
structure
over a five-day period and then exposed to a debate which is edited to
have no
strategic information in it, that is explicit, are more likely to perceive
that the politicians are corrupt; the politicians are acting for
self-interested motives; that there's nothing good that's going to come
out of
the process; that one ought to be uninvolved in the process.  And they're
more
likely, when given new information, to not be able to take the substantive
information out of the new information, but rather to find strategic
content
in it when there isn't any explicitly there.
<p>
The strategy structure is, in our judgment, a structure that activates
cynicism.  The underlying news norms, in our judgment, are structures that
activate a public belief which I think is often mistaken, that our
political
discourse is a substantially debased discourse which does not, in fact,
have
serious consequences for the body politic.  Thank you.
