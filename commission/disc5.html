JOEL FLEISHMAN:  Thank you very much.  Well, we have three
interesting candidates.  I would like to ask some of the synthetic
minds here to try to see if  these candidates, whether they're the
controversial public policies or television or the heritage of the '60s
and
the long-deferred reasonable claims of racial groups--how do you weave all
this together?  And perhaps you can think of some other candidates to
suggest that may be at the root of some of the problems that we have.  
Professor Smelser.
<p>
NEIL SMELSER:  Yes.  This would be by way of trying to complement both
the first and the third speaker and perhaps bring the issue of class up a
little bit more explicitly than either of them did.  One very
interesting--What's that? <p>

Unidentified Man:  That's complimentary ...(unintelligible)
<p>
SMELSER:  Of course.  One of the features of the 1960s development
of affirmative action was to set the civil rights movement and
its definition of the situation as a general model for for further
thinking; and the student movement and other groups, in a way, adopted not
only the philosophy, but also the strategies of the civil rights
movement, which really predated the '60s in large part.
<p>
In particular, I'd like to point to the very interesting growth of the
categorization of American demands that was, in a way, a copy 
of the racial identification that the civil rights movement and
affirmative action did.  The way it multiplied was that other categories
began
to be added in affirmative action terms--Native Americans,
Asian-Americans, Hispanics, women.  And the interesting thing about
it was a lot of this was based on what sociologists call ascribed
characteristics; that is to say, those that are put onto people, either at
birth or by some similar mechanism.
<p>
So you got, from the top--that is to say, in affirmative action
programs--this
categorization--category politics, which later got to be called identity
politics, that was, in a way, a function of the effort to resolve
initially, racial politics, but then generalized.  And I think a lot of
it stands at the root of the peculiarities of conflict in
American society at the present time.  It was a kind of an invitation to,
you might say, primordial politics to make placing of demands on blood
and bloodlike ascribed characteristics that characterizes a lot of the
discourse and, I believe, contributes to a lot of the dichotomization and
absolutization of demands in the area of rights, privileges, employment,
education and so on.
<p>
Another interesting feature of that series of developments was that both
on
the affirmative action side and on the backlash side, there was a common
point
of cultural legitimacy identified; that is to say, equality of
opportunity.
Both opponents and proponents were aiming toward the same symbol of
legitimacy.  Now that's not always the case; as a matter of fact,
frequently
not the case in political struggles, and it really adds complications when
both opponents and proponents are referring to the same system of
legitimacy.
It tends to make the conflict cultural because you're always looking at
some
kind of cultural reference point and outbidding the other with preference
to
what, presumably, is an area of agreement.  That's one setting.
<p>
Then I think what has to be added is that beginning in 1973, class in
reality began to rear its head again and has intensified its real
dimension in
society since that beginning point.  That was the onset, of
course, of the long-term stagnation of real wages in the United States and
the
regressive movement of income distribution in the United States, which
persisted also for at least two decades.
<p>
Now when you superimpose--that's the kind of situation that breeds class
politics--or you might say should breed class politics because 
that's what class is all about.  But somehow or other, the class
dialogue got superimposed on this categorical dialogue and created a kind
of
vast political confusion in this society, which I think persists to the
present day.  Class really is quite absent from most of the discourse
about social conflict, whereas the social realities would suggest that
it's
really there but somehow or other getting expressed in a language that we
inherited from the heritage of affirmative action and its
long-term repercussions into all other groups in society.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  That's very helpful.  Thank you very much.  I have Cass
Sunstein and Edna Ulmmann-Margalit and then Professor Wiebe.
<p>
CASS SUNSTEIN:  This is an effort to take up Joel's invitation for
something synthetic.  When I read the titles of these two sessions,
�How Bad Is It� and  �Hypothesizing Causes,� one reaction is, `How bad is
what?'  and
`Hypothesizing causes of what?'  And I think this would be very good to
try
to identify the `it' whose badness we're trying to quantify and the
phenomenon whose causes we're hypothesizing.  So that's an introduction to
these not terribly long remarks.
<p>
The head of the Federal Communications Commission said in the early 1980s,
`Television is just another appliance.  It's a toaster with pictures.'
That
was his response, and it was a metaphor--very self-conscious--to the claim
that television had civic responsibilities.  The Dole advertisement that
Kathleen Jamieson referred to about the president claiming immunity as a
member of the armed forces, that's actually not true.  The president never
made such a claim.  There was a footnote in the brief arguing by analogy
to that statute, but as anyone who looked at the brief knew, that
claim had been waived in the lower court.  So there's that.
<p>
Now we have a family of `its' and phenomena--that is, the absence of
reason, giving conflict and polarization, incivility, the failure to
invite
further responses, the sound bite phenomenon, violence actual and verbal.
And I think it would be very good to try to concretize the phenomenon in
order
to be able to hypothesize causes.  And some of us were talking last
night--let me say very provisionally what we were trying to identify.
That is
something like a culture of immediacy, where the phenomenon we're
describing
really isn't class division; it's both more and less general, though we
could
describe/discuss something other than this.  But the phenomenon that
seems to unite a lot of what we've discussed is a kind of immediacy to
campaigns, to media practices, to conversation.  And that notion of
immediacy
connotes present driven practices and kind of something like
hysterical reportage. <p>

And then if we were asking, `What are the causes of that?' here's a
hypothesis.  It's really not the 1960s or social policies or television.
It's
two pretty simple ideas.  That is, commercial incentives and rational
ignorance. <p>

And so the causes of this, if that's the 'it', are commercial incentives
and 
rational ignorance.  And there are things to do about both of those
things. 
If you have commercial-driven practices, you know, market incentives, 
then there's--professional norms would be one response, what Jay Rosen 
is talking about.  If it's rational ignorance, then there are practices, 
like what Jim Fishkin is addressing, that would be the answer.  That's
ill-organized but an effort.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  Interesting.  Yes, Edna.
<p>
EDNA ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  Thank you.  I think I want to take another
crack at the 'its' we seem to be discussing now sort of
larger issues.  And I would like to tie in with the talk about the
right[s]
revolution and the race problem.  And new things have been put on the
table
now, sort of large things.  And let me just try to say that the way I see
it--and I think maybe it may contribute to the mission we want to put to
ourselves as a commission--for several decades we have been, I think--used
to
think of most of these social problems in terms of justice and in terms of
distributive justice within a given society--within a given--usually a
state.
And I think that what we are now confronting is a shift in that.  I think
that
the major problem now is not so much justice or distributive justice
within a
given society, but really the question of membership in a society--who
counts,
who belongs, questions of exclusion and inclusion. <p>

And to me, this seems to be, perhaps, the very largest pattern and shift
in
patterns that we are not only observing but living through, and that this
is
the way we have to begin to address that.  Problems of immigration--when
you
say immigration, I really think that's one helpful way of getting out of
the
very America-centered tone of the discussions that we've had most
of yesterday and today and to tie these problems in with the larger world.
I
think that we see real big shifts [in] patterns of--of immigration
internally and
external.  People are crossing the lines--crossing boundary lines of
states
and looking for a better future in other places sometimes within a large
country like the United States.  And sometimes in Europe we see large
patterns and in Asia and so on.
<p>
And these seem to be the major problems confronting many countries and
states today.  I mean, some of the problems we discussed yesterday
of voice, disenfranchised groups, empowerment and so on, this seems to all
tie
in with this very basic question of membership--of membership in a given
society--who is to be considered a member?  And, therefore, maybe the
agenda
of justice--and that refers to racial justice as well perhaps, ought to be
switched now to questions of decency.  And decency will also involve
civility.
And some of you will know of a person of reason, why I mentioned the word
`decency.'  But to me it now captures, perhaps, the new focus of these
major shifts that we are experiencing.  And I think that these questions
of
membership pose a whole new set of problems, which are difficult problems
for
liberals.  They are not quite the kind of frameworks in which liberals
have
been trained and conditioned to think.  Because most of the problems that
liberals have been trained to think of are within a given society.  And
once
we are not clear who belongs and who doesn't belong, all these problems
get a
different focus.  And I would urge us to try and think in these terms.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  Membership also is interesting because if you have a
consideration of who belongs as a member, there's also the question of who
doesn't belong as a member...
<p>
ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  Right, inclusion and exclusion.  Right.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  ...and it really forces those questions.
<p>
ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  Right.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  Professor Wiebe?
<p>
ROBERT WIEBE:  Invariably, the historian wants us to think in
sequence, and I'd like to try to pick up on a number of things, including,
Neil  Smelser's comment about class, to just go through a chronology in
hopes that we will have a better sense of how we want to focus our
attention
if we know what came first and what came second.
<p>
The collapse in faith in public institutions, government and private,
begins,
if we believe public opinion polls, in 1962, when they peak, and has
collapsed
by Watergate.  And if there is some change up and down after that, the sea
change has occurred roughly during that time.  It precedes the most
newsworthy news-attended patterns of violence in the 1960s.  It apparently
comes from some other sources and, certainly, precedes those changes in
media
behavior that have received such emphasis in our discussion, so that
if we want to talk about renewing faith in major institutions, we
need to, as analysts, go back to whatever it is we think we see in those
years.  And here I think that Tom Sugrue's comments are are sort of a
cautionary tale for us, that the 1960s themselves expressed things that
have
been going on for many years before that.
<p>
My own feeling is that we are already talking about matters of combined
class
and race by the time we are at that point where faith in institutions is
crumbling.  And it has a good deal to do with that elitist and secretive
way
of proceeding with changes that we heard about this morning, and
that both whites and blacks who are out of that loop--and that's a large
majority of the population--feel very angry about the way in which
institutions out of their control and out of their vision have, in fact,
made
decisions that have powerful effects on their lives and that
African-Americans
weren't grateful for what they received from the top down and demanded
kinds
of power and authority over their own lives that turned out to be
disruptive
in the way in which politics and public life had proceeded. <p>

But I think whether this is right or wrong--that is,
whether that analysis works for anybody else or only works for me, the
fact is
that if we're going to demonize the media, we should at least recognize
that
at the time this collapse is occurring, the media is really very gentle
and
very, sort of, polite.  This is a time when John Kennedy is screwing
around
and the media wouldn't dare to say anything about it, you know?  This is
the
time where all kinds of things are happening in Washington but the media
is not touching it.
<p>
And if we think of Watergate as a kind of watershed in the way in which
media
goes after public figures, the collapse has already occurred by then.
That
is, public faith in institutions has already occurred.  So the
media sequentially is coming after.  What�s cause and what's effect?  I
don't pretend I can tell you.  But chronogically in sequence, these
changes in media tack, media delegitimization, media negativism are coming
after a sea change has occurred in public attitudes that would sustain or
support that kind of media behavior.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  David?
<p>
DAVID BROMWICH:  Thank you. <p>

FLEISHMAN:  Yes, and then Derek.
<p>
BROMWICH:  I feel with the suffrage of most people, I guess, that
the '60s, which I lived through, were an enormous change for the
better and for the worse.  I just wanted to say that as a counterirritant
to
Thomas Sugrue's, you know, worthy attempt at demythologizing those who
would
say it was only a change for the worse.  His effort, I think, erring on
the
side of saying that it didn't really change that much.  One thing it
changed that I can see in my experience today has to do with some of
the everyday experiences of integrated living, although one can concede
that
there is an enormous amount of persisting racial isolation.
<p>
I think that you were perhaps guilty of the kind of hyperbole that catches
attention but that we're trying to away with for present purposes when you
said that the amount of isolation we see today fits the wildest dreams of
the
engineers of Jim Crow.  If I didn't have you wrong in hearing it that
way, an everyday experience of mine almost is to go to a health club down
the
street in a suburb which is fairly mixed and middle class.  The people
who run the club--that is to say the clerks who greet you at the front,
stick
through your card, tell you how to use the weights and so on, are about 60
percent white, 40 percent black.  The constituency of the club is about 75
percent white, 25 percent black.  I tend to be sullen and silent when I'm
using the machines, but real regulars talk to each other all the time,
slap
each other on the back, male-female contact, black-white contact across
all
sorts of lines that would have been unthinkable--and the male-female is
included in this--in the '50s just happens.
<p>
I would like to point out that I feel that this happens in some areas of
American life today in a way that was unthinkable before 1965 or so.  And
I
wanted to ask the panel eventually and maybe John Skrentny in particular
to
reflect aloud, if you would for us, on why it is that the public discourse
about affirmative action hasn't ever been such as to ask us to reflect how
much of these good changes may have something to do with affirmative
action as
well as anti-discriminatory law?  But I do think there are these changes.
We
don't hear about them, but most of us have experienced them. <p>

In fact, it is not the elite that experience them most, it is
people of the middle class who experience quite a lot of this and take
it for granted and don't go around making racist remarks or raising their
eyebrows.  It's just there.  With it, enormous class division
persists.  But I take it that the difference in manners is a difference in
morality, too, and that is a change for the good and it has something to
do
with the '60s and it is part of where we are now.
<p>


FLEISHMAN:  Anybody want to take a try at answering that or commenting
on that?  Anybody?  John, yes. <p>

SUGRUE: I didn't mean to argue that--I should talk in the
microphone--I'm sorry.  I didn't want to argue that there has been no
change in terms of racial discourse or race relations in the United
States.  I
mean, that's patently false.  I live in a neighborhood that's been
self-consciously racially integrated in Philadelphia since the 1950s, a
place
that would have been unimaginable, you know, a few decades earlier
or...
<p>
BROMWICH:  Not the dream of Jim Crow, in other words.
<p>
SUGRUE:  Exactly. <p>

BROMWICH:  OK. <p>

SUGRUE:  But research by my colleague Doug Massey in the sociology
department shows that patterns of racial residential segregation have
barely
changed between the 1940s and the present.  So for the vast majority of
Americans, there has been very little change in terms of meaningful
day-to-day
interracial contact.  There have been changes on the margins to be sure.
And
those changes are not insignificant.  The changes, say, in the composition
of
academic history departments like mine where there are  black
faculty members and women faculty members who would not have been there
had it
not been for the 1960s.  But those are marginal changes that have affected
largely people like you and me and have not, by and large, affected middle
Americans who continue to live in predominantly white suburbs and work in
predominantly white workplaces and who continue to draw a very sharp
racial
division between their experience and the experience of African-Americans,
the
poor living in the inner city.  So I guess I'm much more
pessimistic ultimately, although I do admit that there have been
significant
changes on the margins.
<p>
BROMWICH:  Yeah, you're dealing with ascriptive attitudes, that I the
projected, imputed attitudes of the white middle class that you're
speaking, of which we are presumably not a part.  And I guess my point was
simply to differ with you on the observation of this ascriptive attitude.
I think that's changed, too.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  Derek.
<p>
DEREK BOK:  Yeah, I just wanted to follow up on the same question.  I
thought
the presentations were very interesting, but Mr. Skrentny points
out that really a lot of these controversial policies got started because
of
the pressures of the Cold War to keep up with the Soviet Union.  But I
would
take it those same pressures existed in the 1950s when there was a great
deal
of concern about the Cold War and yet they didn't produce this reaction.
Similarly, it seems to me, a common point that emerges in Mr. Sugrue's
talk
is, of course, all of these conflicts were quite obvious--racial conflicts
and
others--in other decades, but the point is they didn't erupt into public
consciousness and public dispute until the '60s.
<p>
So something is going on in the '60s which is different from what went on
in
other decades, and it didn't just produce these conflicts; it also
produced
substantial behavioral changes like a very rapid increase in crime.  And
it
didn't just take place in the United States, because you get the same
student
outbursts in Western Europe.  You get a tripling, quadrupling, quintupling
of
crime in countries like Sweden, where the levels of violence were much
lower.
So I think we still have some explaining to do about something that
happened
that probably does have a lot to do with attitudes toward authority, but
something really happened in the 1960s.
<p>
One last point in response to Mr. Wiebe.  I agree with his chronology
exactly, but I think there are two questions you have to ask about the
decline of trust and the growth of cynicism.  One is, why did it drop
initially?  But I do think and I'm sure a lot of that had to do with the
shock of assassinations, with problems with the war against poverty,
Vietnam--I mean, these shocks to complacency that took place.  But
there is a question why that the cynicism has persisted--and it's even a
bit lower today than it was in 1973--and particularly why after it
recovered
about 40 percent of its prior ground in the early '80s did it begin to
decline
to levels that were even below?  And it seems to me that's where the
question
of the relevance of the media might have some bite, that something is
causing the memory of these shocking events not to fade and for the
cynicism to persist long after one might have thought it would pass away.
<p>
WIEBE:  And all kinds of reinforcements are possible.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  I have on the list Calvin Trillin, Leonard
Eron, Richard Lapchick and Paul Verkuil, and I don't think that there's
going
to be much more room beyond that, because I think we're about at the point
that we're going to have to stop in about five minutes.  Is that right,
Steve?
<p>
STEPHEN STEINBERG:  Yeah.  That'd be fine.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  So why don't we proceed on with them, and I can't take any
more names and I'm sorry, but the clock has run out.  So Mr. Trillin.
<p>
CALVIN TRILLIN:  I agree with Professor Sugrue's
analysis of the '50s--I mean, of the '60s in the sense that you could
argue that the '60s began on February 2nd, 1960, in Greensboro with the
sit-ins, which actually, of course, date from the '40s.  The change, I
think
is that they were a response to the fact that nothing happened,
except for the Montgomery bus boycott between 1954 when the border states
desegregated their schools, and 1960 and there were enough black people
educated in the South some of these colleges to take matters into
their own hands and to take control of this movement.
<p>
I think it goes back to what Edna was talking about is who's a member and
who's included, and also what we were talking about this morning.  There's
something much more peaceful for everybody about a gridiron dinner that
nobody
knows about, except that it takes place.  You can kid each other.  You can
even make jokes, probably not to the pointedness or perhaps incivility
of the Imus jokes but pretty close, without anybody getting
excited about it because nobody sees it and the rest of us aren't there.
And
the same is true looking at the '50s, as so many people do now
nostalgically.  It was an awfully nice time if you happened to be a white
male.  It was very pleasant.  It wasn't noisy.  Nobody really talked much
about these other things and everything was fine.  All this stuff, as you
say was going on on the surface, and in a way these things are
sort of the same.
<p>
What it all gets back to a little concern I have that we concentrate
too much in this commission on noise, that or people arguing,
the absence of which probably shows in this society that people
aren't included and are not members of the society.  The more members you
have
the more noise there is, and the more people who are included and who see
things on television, or however they're seen, the more what appears to
be uncivil behavior is known to the public.  But in general, a
certain type of noise is quite necessary in a democracy and
I wouldn't want us to get off on the tangent of worrying about
what really is not even civility but sort of politeness.  It's an impolite
place but I think that's, to many ways, to the good.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  Very helpful.  Professor Eron.
<p>
ERON:  I would like to respond to a num... <p>

FLEISHMAN:  ...microphone.
<p>
ERON:  I would like to respond to a number of comments made by some
of the speakers.  I don't know if we have time for all of them.
<p>
But first, I would like to say to Edna who said that most of our
discussion is US centered and we don't really consider other nations,
other
cultures.  I would like to point out that some of the research that I've
done
has been replicated in four other countries, including Israel and Finland,
Poland, Australia, Israel.  There's one group of 200 children who are not
affected, and you would be interested to know that these were children in
an
Israeli kibbutz.  There we found no relation between the amount of
violence
they watched and how aggressive they were, which was not true of a similar
large--another 200 children in the Tel Aviv public schools.  So there must
be
something about the kibbutz' mores--atmosphere, which tended to discourage
this kind of relation.
<p>
And what we've thought, talking to our Israeli colleagues, is the fact
that,
first of all, there is a real cultural prohibition against violence toward
members of that group--violence towards other kibbutzniks.  And secondly,
television in the kibbutz is watched by children just for one or two
hours.  They all watch together and there is always an adult present who
can
explain to these youngsters that this is not what life is really like.  So
except for that one instance we find the same relation all over, and I
think
there are social reasons for that.
<p>
Cass talked about the need to concretize what's going on, and I don't
think
there's any better example of concretization than in the research done on
television.  We have defined, explicitly, what violence, aggression is.
We
define what television violence is.  We define what the various mediators
are,
and I think this is very concrete.
<p>
Another comment I would like to make is in response to Robert Wiebe
who says that a change in attitudes preceded what's going on in the
media--change in attitudes over the '60s, and then things changed in the
media
after that.  I think we have good research evidence that the media
influence
attitudes.  There may be some of the other--maybe going two ways.  But
certainly the causative effect that's most prominent, as demonstrated in
laboratory studies, in survey studies, is that the media has this power to
change attitudes and does. <p>

FLEISHMAN:  Thank you.  I have Richard Lapchick and then Paul, and
that's it.
<p>
RICHARD LAPCHICK:  Thank you.  First, I wanted to say I'm pleased that
we've focused on the issue of race here, because for me I think it's one
of
the most dangerous issues that's out there in the future of our
society.  And I think one of the things that we sometimes want to dilute
ourselves with is that we'll change when young people grow up and bring
new
values to the system.  We've hired Lou Harris three times now to do
studies on
youth attitudes toward racism, and the virus and plague of racism among
youth runs very deep.  Seventy-five percent of high school
students in the most recent survey told Harris that they have seen overt
acts
of racism often or somewhat often in their high schools in the previous 12
months. <p>

A phenomenon that started in Boston several years ago and has now spread
around the country is white high school students wearing Notre Dame hats
to
school.  Initial response was there are a lot of Irish people in
Boston--we're
all fans of the Fighting Irish--until the black students started wearing
UNLV
hats and there was a popularity for UNLV basketball in the black community
at
one point, but these were not about sport symbols.  Notre Dame--the ND
stood
for `niggers die.'  The black response was if you come after us, we're
going to defend ourselves.  `UNLV,' in fact, stood for `us niggers love
violence'--don't mess with us we're going to protect ourselves.
<p>
I think we've gotten some wonderful perspectives when Edna and Marie
talked
about what's going on in their countries.  And maybe I'll conclude with
the fact that I'm writing a book about a Bosnian junior Olympic basketball
team that was smuggled out of Sarajevo under very dangerous circumstances
in 1993.  And when I asked the 19 boys why they chose to risk their lives
to get out, they said because they had seen so many children killed in the
streets of Bosnia and had seen how people had learned how to hate each
other
on the basis of what they believed in.  And they all now live in the
United
States.  They're all feeling very secure.  But the most disappointing
thing
that they've found about living in America is that children are being
killed
in the streets and people have learned how to hate each other on the basis
of
what they look like or sometimes about their religion.
<p>
I think that the ideal circumstance that Professor Guinier laid out for us
yesterday, where so many different people of different groups were
together in
one class as equals sharing, debating and analyzing things is something
that still is so rare in this country.  We rarely get together as equals
in a
forum where we have an equal input.  And I just wanted to mention that
about
American youth.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  Thank you.  Paul, final word.
<p>
PAUL VERKUIL:  Thank you I'm thinking about the 60s again, since we were
all
there.  Is this on?
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  Yeah.
<p>
VERKUIL:  Sorry.  What you left out a little bit is--I didn't hear
enough of--was the Vietnam War, especially that discussion.  And we
can't ignore the fact, it goes back to what David said, too, about how
things have worked out. I mean, I had the--I mean, I had the
opportunity to serve in the Army and then be part of the anti-war
movement.
And I could see a lot of this emerging.
<p>
But, first of all, the Vietnam War repudiated the liberal values for the
black
community, because the blacks were serving in disproportionate
percentagewise
in Vietnam.  And the liberals were, you know, either avoiding the draft or
fighting the whole point of view and so there was a real split there that
perhaps has never fully been joined again.  I think there's a lack of
trust, which came partially through Vietnam.
<p>
Now the other side of it is that Vietnam was also an opportunity where
there
was a lot of integration and where, you know, black and white fought side
by
side, which they hadn't been permitted to do really in the military much
before that.  That was the first truly integrated war--World War II not
being that, and [during ]Korea Harry Truman had integrated the military,
but it hadn't really taken effect as much, I think.  Statistically you
could
probably show that.  So that in a sense had a positive impact on bringing
people together.  The community notion that people could serve next to
each
other, respect the fact that they were valid protection of their own
life and existence, and yet it continues on.
<p>
I think Vietnam didn't come before this and it can't be the cause--is
truly a central part of the '60s and the '70s because it showed that
political leadership could not cope.  I mean, the embarrassments
that we had both with Johnson and then Nixon.  No one really thought at
the end of the day that we had any good leadership in that decade and
largely
because of Vietnam.
<p>
The other point, quickly, and that is I thought you mentioned, which may
be something to pursue and that's immigration, where it's taking us.  I
think
maybe we could see some developments about if we think things
are bad kind of, maybe they're getting worse, immigration is what's going
to
lead us there as much as anything.  We did have the opening up in the '60s
of opportunities for immigration from groups that were
excluded--minorities in particular.  Family reunion became a value, and so
a lot of people came to this country.  We had the legalization of
illegal immigrants only 10 years ago, which put a lot of people who were
already in this country [in an]underground society.
<p>
We gave them membership, but the consequences of that were that
they could then benefit from family reunions in a sense that
we've added a lot of people to our society.  We are now rethinking
that.  We're not just rethinking it.  Western Europe is rethinking it.
Many
other places perhaps.  Certainly in Asia, there's always been a lot of
resistance to immigration, and so maybe that's one of the handles--what's
happening in immigration past and present that we could look to.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  Thank you all on the panel for carrying the discussion
forward.  I think we are scheduled now for a working lunch.
<p>
RODIN:  Right.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  And I think you're going to tell us about where that is.
<p>
RODIN:  I will.  What I'd ask you to do is to get lunch, which is outside
I
think.  We'll find out as soon as we walk out.  And just load your plates
and bring it back because we will have a working lunch, talk about three
very
interesting examples of efforts to grapple with some of these issues, and
then
move on to really concluding and pointing ourselves for the work of the
commission going forward.  Thank you.
<p>
