<p>
JOEL FLEISHMAN:  Thank you very much, Professor Eron.  Our third presenter
will be the historian Thomas Sugrue from the University of
Pennsylvania, where he has taught since 1991.  His new book, The Origins
of
the Urban Crisis:  Race and Inequality in Post-War Detroit, won the
President's Book Award of the Social Science History Association.  A
specialist in 20th-century American history, Professor Sugrue is widely
known
at Penn for his course on the social and political history of the 1960s,
which
will be the focus of his presentation this morning.
<p>
THOMAS SUGRUE I'm going to begin by
pitching a heterodoxy to you that I hope you'll find provocative and will
generate some interesting discussion.  The 1960s are an enormous millstone
around the neck of the American body politic.  In our quest for simple
explanations of economic inequality, racial polarization and civic
disengagement in America in our time, we reflexively turn to the events of
the
1960s as an explanation.  Whether it be the Great Society and the
expansion of
the welfare state, urban riots, the rise of the counterculture in the new
left, the emergence of white backlash politics or the spread of identity
politics throughout our campuses, the events of the 1960s have become a
political catch-all for our collective anxieties.
<p>
Newt Gingrich points to the reign of counterculture McGovernicks.  When
South
Carolina housewife Susan Smith drowned her children, Gingrich pointed his
finger to Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society.  Welfare reformers across
the
political spectrum, from Charles Murray to Bruce Reed, blame the war on
poverty for persistent, concentrated urban poverty.  An urban underclass
emerged, it is argued, because of the perverse incentives of welfare
unleashed
by the social programs of the 1960s.  Compounding the situation that
conventional wisdom goes were the sexual liberation movements of the 1960s
that legitimated out-of-wedlock pregnancy and divorce.  The 1960s, it is
also
argued in conventional wisdom, are to to blame for the travails of
liberalism.  The New Deal order collapsed in the late 1960s under the
weight
of the supposed excesses of 1960s liberalism led by special-interest
groups
who put their parochial demands above the common good. <p>

The view of the 1960s is the apocalypse of consensus is the pyre of
civility,
is rooted in a still very limited body of scholarship on the 1960s, a
limited
body of scholarship that has, nonetheless, been enormously influential.
Consider the titles of some of the leading synthetic overviews of the
history
of the '60s:  "The Unraveling of America," "Coming Apart," "A Time of
Passion," "Years of Discord," "The Dream and the Nightmare," "Chain
Reaction."
Underlining these books is a contrast of the 1960s with America's golden
age,
the 1940s and the 1950s, an era when Americans supposedly shared common
political values and a domestic pox Americana, glued together by
authority,
order and, above all, civility.
<p>
America in the post-war years, this image goes, was inclusive.  America
after
the 1960s, it is argued, was Balkanized.  Politics in the 1950s, it's
argued,
emphasized commonality; politics after the 1960s emphasized difference.
Paraphrasing Virginia Woolf, or bastardizing Virginia Woolf, the argument
goes
that, sometime around May 1968, human character fundamentally changed.
<p>
But the contrast between postwar America between the 1940s and the 1950s
and
the 1960s, I argue, is much overstated.  If we peel away or probe beneath
the
veneer of affluence, homogeneity and consensus that shape our
understanding of
America in the 1940s and in the 1950s, we find a far more troubled society
whose reality belies many of the comfortable shibboleths that we use to
describe it. <p>

There are four larger points that I'd like to make about American history
at
the mid-20th century that I think are germane to many of the issues that
we're discussing.  First, American politics and culture did change in
important ways in the 1960s, particularly in attitudes towards expertise,
government and authority.  But those changes, I contend, did not emerge de
novo out of the conflicts of the 1960s, but were the consequence of
long-term
political, cultural and demographic changes, changes that were already
well
under way by the 1940s and the 1950s.
<p>
Secondly, there were already deep fissures in American politics in the
seemingly complacent 1940s and 1950s, fissures that were masked by postwar
triumphalism and hidden by a superficial civility that glossed over
persistent
racial and gender inequality and entrenched poverty.
<p>
Third, the 1960s brought the tensions and contradictions of post-Second
World
War American life to the surface.  It peeled away that veneer of consensus
and
civility.  The social movements of the 1960s brought to national attention
deep-rooted and largely unsolved problems that had been off of the
national
agenda in the 1940s and 1950s.  These problems that '60s social movements
focused on were, by and large, not new.  They weren't peculiar to the
1960s.  Rather, they were the expression of decades of simmering but
largely
unexpressed discontent.
<p>
Fourth--and this, I think, ties into Professor Jamieson's point in the
last discussion--the media in the 1960s focused disproportionately on
conflict, on the transgressive, not on continuities and similarities
between
the 1960s and what had preceded it.  It is that emphasis on discontinuity
that
I contend has continued to distort our understanding of the era and, by
implication, our understanding of the woes of contemporary America.
<p>
With these points in mind, I want to turn our focus to one issue
that was extremely important in the politics of America in the 1960s, an
issue
that has been, I think, strangely absent from much of our discussion over
the
last day and a half, and that is the question of race and politics.  There
is
a compelling reason to focus on race, and that is that there is no area of
American life more characterized by incivility, polarization, shallowness
and
social fragmentation than race relations.  Other social divisions in the
United States pale in comparison to the dilemma of race relations.
Perhaps
the most salient feature of American life in the 1940s, in the 1950s and
in
the 1960s and beyond is a persistence of racial divisions in American
life.
To be sure, notions of race have changed profoundly in the decades
following
World War II, in part because of some of the Cold War issues that John
Skrentny discussed in his talk.
<p>
Concepts of race, of blackness, of whiteness are not fixed binaries.
They're
not unchanging historical constants.  But three patterns in race relation
in
America between World War II and the present have remained largely
unchanged,
despite decades of civil rights activism, despite shifts in popular
attitudes
and despite a reconfiguration of racial images in public discourse and
in popular culture.
<p>
First, blacks and whites in the United States continue to live in almost
complete racial isolation, a degree of racial isolation, indeed, that
would
have fulfilled the greatest dreams of the architects of Jim Crow.
Secondly,
economic inequality in the United States throughout this entire period of
the
mid-20th century up to the present--economic inequality has been
disproportionately borne by African-Americans.  Thirdly, racial suspicion
runs
extremely deep in American politics, manifested most profoundly in the
enormous rifts between city and suburbs, rifts that grew in the period
between
the 1940s and the present and were largely unaffected by the social
movements
of the 1960s.
<p>
Commentators on incivility in American life inevitably point to racial
matters, usually to black separatism, to black cultural forms like rap,
and
look to the roots of these politics in the 1960s, going back to the urban
riots into the rise of black power as integrationism gave way to
Afrocentrism.  A common American identity, it is argued, has been eroded
by
black demands for separatism and their protestation of authentic
blackness.
American campuses are divided as black and white students live and eat
separately.  Post-1960s African-American leaders like Louis Farrakhan and
Al Sharpton have repudiated collaborative interracialism, discussing black
pride and fueling the flames of racial resentment for their own political
gain, it is argued, taking their cues from the likes of Huey P. Newton and
Stokely Carmichael.
<p>
Rappers Sister Souljah and Public Enemy incite black youth to racial
violence
and undermine the authority of legitimate institutions such as government
and
the police.  They alienate white supporters and drive disaffected white
voters
into the arms of the Republicans.  But these racial divisions, the racial
divisions that are highlighted in black popular culture, that are
highlighted
by black nationalist politicians, that were highlighted in the social
movements of the 1960s, are not new.
<p>
As conventional wisdom would have it, they are not the repudiation of a
common
inclusive Americanness.  They are not the result of the passing of a
supposed
golden age of integrationism and racial inclusionism in the 1940s, '50s
and
1960s.  They did not emerge as a consequence of the Great Society and its
supposed excesses or the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or of black power and
affirmative action.  The outburst of anger on the part of
African-Americans in
the 1960s and beyond has been an attempt--often inarticulate, sometimes
ineffective, to be sure--but an attempt to challenge a status quo in which
whole sections of the population were marginalized, their voices muffled
in
the postwar era of conformity and civility.
<p>
The racial protests of the 1960s raised in clear relief the contradictions
of
affluent America, a society that professed opportunity while more than a
fifth
of the population lived beneath the poverty line and nearly half of
African-Americans lived beneath the poverty line.  It raised in clear
relief
the contradiction of the society that professed inclusion, while the
government and the private sector continued to institutionalize racial
barriers--racial barriers in residence, racial barriers in education and
racial barriers in the workplace, racial barriers that proved to be
extraordinarily resistant to change.  Above all, the racial protests of
the
1960s, with all of their incivility, pointed their finger at the failure
of
mid-20th-century American politics, particularly mid-20th-century American
liberals, to adequately address the root causes of racial inequality in
the
United States.
<p>
Race was the Achilles' heel of the New Deal.  Mid-20th-century American
politicians, with a few notable exceptions, attempted to dodge the issue
of
structural, racial inequality in the United States.  Their solutions, by
and
large, were gradualist, and they were gradualist because the costs of
upsetting the racial status quo in a majority white society and in a
society--and in a congressional order dominated by the South--the costs
were
simply too great.  Above all, the postwar racial order rested on a
Faustian
bargain between Northern Democrats and the segregationist South.
<p>
This is a familiar story that I'm just going to encapsulate briefly here.
Mid-20th century liberalism was, to borrow a choice phrase from the
political
scientist Ira Katznelson, `a strange marriage between South Africa and
Sweden.'  Social democracy was constrained in the United States by its
accommodation to the politics of white supremacy.  The issue of race in
the
South has proved to be the biggest constraint on the agenda of civil
rights
over the course of the 20th century.  Southern Democrats in the 1960s and
their successors, the Southern Republicans, have proved to be enormously
powerful in shaping and limiting the national civil rights agenda.
<p>
Democratic presidential candidates depended on the solid South for their
electoral success, and increasingly Republicans are now depending on the
solid
Republican South for their electoral success.  Thus, politicians have an
incentive to avoid grappling with any serious racial issues.  And in the
1960s
they finally did grapple with those issues, but when it was too late.
They
didn't grapple with them until black protesters, in all their incivility,
forced their hand.
<p>
But the longevity of racial conflict in the United States is not simply a
consequence of the intransigence of the South.  By 1960, a majority of the
country's African-American population lived in the North, mostly in major
metropolitan areas.  And it was there, in this supposedly liberal bastion
of
the North, where the dream of racial equality was dashed on the rocks of
racial conflict.  It was in places like Detroit, Chicago, New York and
Boston
in the 1940s and 1950s, these places that were the epicenter of the New
Deal
order--it's there that the promise of racial equality died.
<p>
Just as the concept of race was up for grabs in popular culture, just as
the American media was moving towards a more inclusive discourse of
race, working- and middle-class whites rallied around the politics of
racial
defensiveness.  They turned to the ballot box, to protests and to violence
to
protect their racial privileges.  In the 1940s and the 1950s, major
Northern
cities were plagued by white-on-black violence.  In Detroit, the place
that
I've studied, for example, between the mid-1940s and the mid-1960s , there 
were more than 200 racial incidents involving attacks on the first
African-Americans 
to move into formerly white neighborhoods--whites defending the color line 
in urban space.
<p>
The result is that race, because of what happened in the North and the
South,
got put on the back burner, until protests and urban unrest in the 1960s
and,
above all, growing black political power in the North, forced it to the
center
of national politics in the 1960s.  When black racial consciousness and
white
backlash burst onto the national scene in the 1960s, it was the logical
consequence of years of racial neglect, not a repudiation of a supposedly
race-blind integrationist political order.
<p>
In conclusion, the legacy of decades of racial conflict and racial
backlash in
the United States, even in the superficially moderate, consensus-driven
1940s
and 1950s--the legacy of generations of racial conflict has set the
groundwork for the intense racial incivility that persists in American
society
through today.  The fragmentation of American society by race that
characterized post-World War II America exploded on the streets in the
1960s
and continues to simmer.  Until we grapple with the deeply entrenched
politics
of racial division in modern America, our attempts to restore civil
society
will remain hollow.  Thank you.
