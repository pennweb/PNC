JUDITH RODIN:  Good morning.   To most of you, welcome back, and to those
members of the commission and guests who are with us for the first time,
I'm
Judith Rodin and it's my very great pleasure to welcome you here and
have you join us.  This is the second meeting of the Penn National
Commission on Society, Culture and Community.  We hope that you find
this place, with its historic connections dating back to the 18th
century, a fitting and inspiring place for our deliberations.  As many
of you know, the American Philosophical Society is just another of
Benjamin Franklin's bright ideas, along with lightning rods and
bifocals and the University of Pennsylvania.
<p>
More importantly, both Penn and the American Philosophical Society,
like most of Franklin's inventions, are embodiments of his
extraordinary and, at the time, quite unique vision of the integration
of theory and practice.  In this educational as well as scientific
philosophy, Franklin really drew on the Zeitgeist of his age, the
Enlightenment certainty that reason and common sense--and I think that
they saw no difference between the two--could solve all human problems
if properly applied, and certainly nowhere was that more rigorously
tested than here in the colonial heart of Olde City Philadelphia.
<p>
Within a block of this building, the vision nurtured the political
framework and the political institutions that formed our nation.  The
same vision also created America's first free library, its first
firefighting company, its first learned society and its first
university.  It is that same spirit, I believe and hope, that guides
our deliberations; a belief that academic and professional expertise
have a direct and important contribution to make to the problems of
our day, just as Franklin and his contemporaries wrestled with the not
unrelated problems of their day.
<p>
As you know, the Penn National Commission originated out of a concern
for the declining quality and the declining effectiveness of public
discourse, the incivility of so much of our public culture, and the
increasing separation and isolation of groups and of individuals.  As
we discussed these problems during our first meeting last December, it
became increasingly evident that many of these phenomena exemplify the
impact of mass-market values and dynamics on our politics, on our
entertainment and on our expectations.  Many of you spoke of a culture
of immediacy that amounts to wanting it all, wanting it now and
wanting it absolutely.
<p>
This culture fosters attitudes and expectations that make it
permissible to vent our rage and frustration no matter how innocent
the provocation; that make contempt and intolerance seem like rational
responses to imagined slights and injustices; that make leaders
fearful of challenging their constituencies and communities sometimes
fearful of everyone.  As we draw the circle of safety and acceptance
ever tighter, the domain of reasoned and reasonable discourse becomes
ever narrower or sometimes disappears altogether as the habits of
in-your-face confrontation begins to infect our government, our
schools, our places of worship and our workplaces.
<p>
The resulting blurring of public and private spheres of behavior make
setting standards of conduct and decorum ever more difficult.  Yet
as we talked last December, it also became clearer that the public
policies and the market incentives that create such a sustained
culture are also of quite enormous power.  In many respects, they're
rooted in our deepest value commitments to freedom of expression,
individual liberty and free-market economics.
<p>
This is one of the reasons why we can look back and find similar
periods of heightened incivility throughout our history.  As we
discussed at our last meeting, some of these contemporary phenomena
are neither as new nor as different as they may first appear.  What is
new or maybe new at least is the context in which they occur.  That
context is shaped by the advent of new means of communication, by new
techniques of mass marketing and by the decline of other institutions
which once served as alternative venues for rational deliberation.
<p>
Some observers of these changes propose that we try to restore the
behavioral patterns, the institutions and the values of a bygone era;
others call for dampening the robust dialogue that must
exist at the heart of any democracy.  Some believe that the answer
lies in volunteerism and community service, in philanthropy or civil
society.
<p>
Our discussions have pointed in these directions but also in a
somewhat different direction:  forward, towards the future.  We seemed
at our last meeting to share the notion that whether better or worse,
the future will certainly be different from the past, and that like
our predecessors here in Philadelphia more than 200 years ago, we must
begin to create the ideas, the models of leadership and the visions of
community that will be useful to our descendants in meeting the
challenges of the 21st century.
<p>
That's the process we hope to begin during our meeting here today and
tomorrow--to generate ideas that can change behaviors, inspire leaders and
build new forms of community. <p>
