SUBJECT:  Summary of First Working Group Meeting (6/12/97)


The following is a brief summary of the first meeting of the Working Group
on Culture and Public Behavior.  It is being sent to you via the working
group's listserv to further discussion among its members of the group's
orientation and initial tasks.  To respond to all members of the Working
Group on Culture and Public Behavior, just use the "reply" feature on your

MEETING SUMMARY:

The Working Group's first meeting took place on June 12, 1997 and focused
on two issues:

*      limiting the group's focus to public  behaviors
        (i.e., excluding private behaviors, such as drug-use,
        divorce, unmarried pregnancies, abortion, and "road rage"); and

*      setting itself the initial task of redefining behavioral
'       norms in the public sphere.

The group started from the presupposition that we are living in a time of
profound change, when there is great and widespread dissatisfaction with
public culture and with the character of interpersonal interactions and
exchanges within the public sphere.  But, as Commission members repeatedly
articulated throughout the two-day Commission meetings, there are
alternative conceptions of what public behavior might look like which can
be put together into a coherent, systematic vision.  Both leaders and the
general public "want to do better," but they need to be shown in concrete
ways how it is possible to do better.

The group agreed to take as its initial task the work of articulating such
a normative vision of what interpersonal interaction and behavior should
be
in the public realm.  This involves redefining some of the traditional
goods of democractic societies -- some conceptions which may never have
been clearly defined and others that may need to be redefined in the light
of experience or contemporary circumstances.

In this task of defining what it regards as the normative standards of all
kinds of public interactions, it was suggested that the group focus on a
limited number of areas in which it thinks those norms can be usefully
redefined.   This process should also help the group to explore more
carefully the origins of the current dissatisfaction with the character of
public behavior, and thus, to describe and analyse the problem of "a
culture of intolerance" more clearly and concretely.

Some of the norms the group might look at -- and this is not yet a
determinative list -- are:

*      the private/public distinction and where the
        boundaries of privacy should be drawn;

*      tolerance, especially regarding intolerant groups,
        absolutism, fundamentalism, and intolerant behaviors;

*      inclusiveness and access;

*      isolation of groups and individuals from one another
        and the lack of engagement across differences;

*      equity/fairness distinctions, including issues of rights
        and the absolutism that is so often associated with
        claims to rights; and

*      adversarial styles of dispute resolution as they relate
        to the larger culture (i.e., not as a professional issue in
        specific professions, such as the law).

Though the working group plans to start with a specific focus on the
public sphere and with the task of defining the norms of interactions that
occur in public, it anticipates that other issues -- such as the role of
institutions (e.g., the media, religious institutions, corporations,
governement, universities)  in determining and reinforcing behavioral
norms -- will grow out of the conversation regarding the re-definition of
these normative concepts. 

[Though it was not discussed during the meeting, one could imagine here
collecting or commissioning research on a number of issues that might
inform the Working Group's and the Commission's consideration of normative
changes.  For example:

*       current behavioral norms,

*       attitudes towards change in public norms,

*       systematic behaviors that contribute to the
         destruction or weakening of norms;

*       preferences regarding the direction of changes, and

*       comparisons with or assessments of societies in which
         norms are very different than those currently operative
         in the United States. -sps]

In the light of the group's focus on interactions and exchanges that occur
in public, rather than private, the working group has tentatively decided
to change its name to "Culture and Public Behavior" (though other variants
on this are possible) in order to emphasize that it wants to focus on the
public sphere and interactions that occur therein, not on what goes on at
home and in the bedroom, and in places of that sort.

The group's first task is to begin redefining the norms of public behavior
and to articulate thereby its vision of how our society can "behave
better"  in "the commons."  It is hoped that the group could have a draft
to present to the Commission at the start of the December meeting.  This
would set the stage for the major plenary sessions of that meeting which
will focus on the responsibilities of major institutions -- corporations,
government, and universities -- to set and reinforce such norms and
standards for public behavior and a concluding session in which the
Commission might consider the working group's proposals. 

This suggests several immediate questions for continued discussion via
listserv:

1.  Is this is a useful way in which to proceed?  In particular, do those
who were unable to attend the first meeting have alternative or
supplementary suggestions?

2.  Does the group need to add to, subtract from, or re-name some of the
normative areas it wants to look at?

3.  How should the group go about the task of re-conceptualizing norms in
these areas?  (Dividing them up amongst the members is one obvious
possibility.)

4.  Are there other tasks the group or the Commission staff should
undertake at this stage to further the group's work?

5.  In particular, would the collection or commissioning of research
regarding some of the topics suggested above (i.e., current behavioral
norms, attitudes towards change in public norms, systematic behaviors that
weaken norms, preferences regarding the direction of changes, or
comparisons with and assessments of societies in which norms are very
different, or other topics) be of utility at this stage?

From: robert h wiebe <r-wiebe@NWU.EDU>
Subject:      conversation


The advantage of e-mail is that I don't feel obliged to think through
everything I send; the disadvantage is that you get my half-baked
thoughts.  Sorry.  Nevertheless, it does seem sensible to continue our
conversation. 

What follows is a preliminary effort to recast our enterprise without
losing the spirit of Stephen's very useful summary of our initial
exchange.  It makes no claims to comprehensiveness.  It's meant to
illustrate an approach.  It's repetitive and linear:  all kinds of
overlaps and interrelationships will be immediately evident. 

I encourage us to think about our task as an exploration of tensions
rather than a search for norms.  Perhaps the latter will emerge from the
former:  let that happen if it happens.  Now, however, I believe we are
best served by picturing ourselves in a field of competing claims, an
environment of many alternative visions with a wide range of
justifications that at least deserve serious attention.  With apologies
for oversimplication, these lines of tension come to mind. 

1.  The pull between civility and voice, between rules of respect,
mutuality, and accommodation on one hand and on the other the latitude
that people previously marginalized or excluded from public discussion
require/deserve in order to find their own places, not get places assigned
to them.  The very first breath in the commission's life--the exchange
between Judith Rodin and Joyce Appleby--exposed this tension.  Without
some common understanding about give and take, there can be no public
discussion.  Yet one person's civility is another person's gag:  manners
carry the power to control. 

2.  The pull between reasoned and expressive public exchanges:  Habermas
vs.  the encounter group.  How can we resolve complicated public issues if
we do not reason with one another?  How can we resolve complicated public
issues if we do not give vent to their emotional charge?  Formal debates? 
Guerrilla theater?  If you abandon logic, we cease communicating.  If you
won't listen to me at all, I must begin by blocking your doorway. 

3.  The pull between personal claims and collective restraints.  For a
variety of reasons, only some of them constitutional, pornography strikes
me as a particularly rich area for examination.  Boom-box rap might be
another.  Whatever enables us to explore the complicated boundaries
between the rights of individuals and the requirements of public life.  As
Rochelle Gurstein's stimulating THE REPEAL OF RETICENCE recently reminded
me (read it if you haven't!), in large areas of our culture, "community
rights" is construed as an oxymoron--like bright darkness. 

4.  The pull between privacy and engagement.  "Engagement" isn't quite
right; perhaps privacy isn't either--but what the hell.  Under what
circumstances can people restrict the public uses of spaces that seem to
have public attributes?  Leafleting and otherwise proselytizing in
shopping malls is one example.  Seen one way, malls are the modern-day
equivalents of the town square; seen another, they are private property
where owners and users alike have a stake in maintaining optimum
commercial conditions.  Classroom use is another.  Some among us may think
of classrooms as sacred spaces in our priestly care; others may envisage a
forum open to changing, sometimes spontaneous public uses--contested
spaces, in other words.  The Jehovah's Witness sound truck in a quiet
residential neighborhood fits as well here as in #3.  (I purposely exclude
privacy vs. computer-generated data about my health, wealth, and welfare;
privacy vs. sodomy laws;  privacy vs. media intrusion; etc.) 

5.  The pull between normlessness in constituting the public and
value-based exclusions/condemnations restricting it.  The tolerance issue. 
Too many exclusions--or exclusions of certain kinds--we label intolerance. 
Too few judgments--or the failure to judge certain actions--risks
validating . . .  here fill in the blank with your favorites:  Nazis,
Stalinists, Suhartos, militiamen. 

6.  The pull between buying public messages and guaranteeing their
transmission. The access issue.  'Buckley v. Valeo' at one end; free TV
time at the other.  In a capitalist society, is money the indispensable
means for disseminating information?  What is the public stake in ensuring
many voices in public debate? Who gets what kind of media access?  Should
the public be treated as if it were an audience?  Is public debate
eligible for Nielson ratings?  Should audience a.k.a. public response
determine who speaks? 

7.  The pull between efficient resolution and maximum participation. 
Public life as a problem-solving arena vs. public life as a
citizen-affirming arena.  Focusing on the outcome, focusing on the
process.  Participatory democracy as a procedure from hell, as an
ideal-type. 

Please don't mistake this approach as an invitation to mindless
Aristoteleanism. Looking for the gold-plated, difference-splitting mean is
not my idea of a useful activity.  And of course if we restated these
pairings as webs of interconnection, we'd face very different challenges
and choices.  My question is:  is this approach promising enough to
pursue?
