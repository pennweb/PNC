FROM:   Steve Steinberg, Executive Director, Penn National Commission

I am pleased to announce that Neil Smelser, director of the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, has agreed to chair the working
group on Culture and Public Behavior.

You should all have received, via email, both my preliminary summary of
our discussion at the June meeting and Bob Wiebe's thoughtful commentary
on ways of framing the group's task.  Together, these should provide a
useful basis for continued discussion and refinement, via the working
group's email listserv.  Just use the "reply" feature on your email system
or enter the listserv email address ( pnc-behavior@lists.upenn.edu ) to
continue the conversation. 

Best regards,
Steve Steinberg

Subject:      Neil's memos

I've just seen Neil's two memos and I hasten to respond.  Never fear.  I
will not try to exhume my earlier email.  If ever a memo was buried in
silence, that one was.  May it rest in peace.  Nevertheless, I do have
concerns that I need to express at least once more.

I hope very much that we do not lose a working distinction between public
and private. It may be useful to be reminded of the truism that these can
never be hermetically sealed categories, that private becomes public and
public affects private in fluid ways, and that a behaviorial test helps us
follow those subtle processes.  (For technical reasons beyond my ability
to explain, I don't have access to Neil's memos as I write.  Please excuse
my poor summaries.)  Yet all of us employ those terms as if they
communicate something general and significant.  In that soft sense, I
believe they remain critical to our enterprise. 

An autistic relative generates steady concern in my family because his
behavior--in your face conversation, inappropriate questions, and the
like--disturbs others.  Swimming is his major recreation; he is always on
the verge of losing rights at public pools.  A close friend with
Tourette's faces similar public problems.  I hope we call all such issues
private and exclude them. 

The presence or absence of the law does not seem to me the critical issue.
I am deeply in Catharine MacKinnon's debt for what she has taught me about
the culture of sex.  But if a MacKinnon ordinance on pornography became
law, it would still have as its justification what pornography legitimized
in private realms where women have inadequate defenses against men.
Domestic violence is a horrific issue--beyond our scope, I believe.
HARDWICK may be the law, but my guess is that many of our committee would
like consensual sex that does no one damage to remain a private choice.

If we deal with driveby shootings, let's concentrate on the shootings, not
on the motivations--rage, anomie, racism, whatever--of the shooter.  As a
longtime subscriber to NATION, I am appalled by how often otherwise
intelligent editorial writers declare with confidence that economic
equality would cure all psychosocial pathologies.  As best we can, let's
stay out of other people's minds.

Unlike Neil, I am arguing against carefully articulated definitions.
Instead, I'm asking for an awareness, an alertness to the dangers of
sinking into swamps where we only expose our preconceptions.  I'm sure we
all realize what a tiny fraction of our society we reflect and how willy
nilly that limits our abilities to understand.

Which brings me back to my original concern.  I worry about our taking the
path toward a prescriptive report.  Once again, I gladly acknowledge the
truism that norms suffuse our thinking and that all language communicates
values.  Whatever we say, however we say it, will express assumptions
about better and worse.  So once again I am hoping for an orientation, a
sense of our enterprise that makes us exceedingly cautious about seeming
to pronounce rules of right conduct.  People negotiate the meaning of
civility in their society.  We should seek to illuminate that process of
negotiation in ours, to further it if we can, and to be as modest as we
can in declaring what is unacceptable in other people's behavior.  America
is not our workplace; we don't set the rules. 

Perhaps I suffer from cultural paranoia.  Perhaps I see the threat of
imposed standards lurking in memos where none exists.

A final bow to David Bromwich, who exploded at my suggestion we do away
with 'tolerance' as one of our keywords.  I'm a convert.  As applied to
the old Toleration Acts of the 18th and 19th centuries, I think the term
serves us well.  Protestants were still sure that those Catholics would go
to hell and fry with their pope, but for a complex of reasons they would
tolerate their (public) presence.  Not a bad guide for reckoning with some
of our deep dislikes.

Subject:      Memorandum

Date:   August 22, 1997

To:     Members of Working Group on Culture of Behavior, Penn National
        Commission

From:   Neil Smelser

Re:     Getting rolling


        By now you all know that Judy Rodin has asked me to chair this
Working Group, and that I have accepted that assignment with enthusiasm.
However, you have not heard from me as yet.  This is because I have been
much on the road in July and August--as have many of you, I am
certain--and have not been able to take any initiatve.  Now that I am
back, and in full realization that we are going to be on stage at the
December meeting of the Commission, I am contacting you all to get and
keep our conversation action moving.

        I am going to proceed by doing three things right away:

        (1) Today, in this memo I am going to record some thoughts about
our mission.  These are meant as orienting and shaping remarks.  These
thoughts have crystallized as I studied (a) Judy's letter of invitation to
chair the working group and (b) Steve Steinberg's "summary of working
group meeting," mailed to all of us on June 19.  While I could not be at
the June meeting, those notes were very informative, and I hope that the
remarks that follow continue the spirit of that meeting.

        (2) Early next week I am going to send you some pointed questions,
stemming from today's memo and from Robert Wiebe's thoughtful
communication dated July 1.
In that coming communiction I am going to begin asking all of you to begin
responding to the group with your ideas.

        (3) Later next week I will be calling some if not all of you as a
follow-up, as a way of further encouraging you to join our conversation
and planning.

        Now to my initial thoughts:

*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *

        It seems clear from Steve's summary that the group decided that
the best course for its work would be to "[articulate a] normative vision
of what interpersonal interaction and behavior should be in the public
realm."  This seems a very reasonable task.  According to Steve's note,
the group also commented that this task may call for some redefinitions
and new definitions about democratic societies and how life should be
conducted within them.  The group also decided to limit itself to "public"
behaviors and exclude "private" concerns.

        I agree with the mission and the qualifiers put on it, and I would
like to begin by saying that the definitions and conceptualizations of
ambiguous and confusing terms should be a first task.  I do not want to
turn the group into an academic debating society about first principles,
but I found some confusions in the summary of the group meeting, and would
like to set out some ideas that might focus our thinking to some degree.
The two areas I would like to comment on are (a) the distinction between
"public" and "private"; and (b) the nature of normative regulation, both
of which lie at the center of the group's mission.

Public and Private

        In the summary of the June 12 meeting I read that the group wanted
to focus on public behaviors and to exclude "private behaviors," examples
of which are drug-use, divorce, unmarried pregnancies, abortion, and "road
rage."  According to the summary, the group also excluded "what goes on at
home and in the bedroom, and in places of that sort" and wished to focus
on behavior in "the commons."  Elsewhere the summary identified the
concept of "public norms", which presumably can be identified as a class
of norms separate from "private norms" or at least from a "private realm"
in which "public norms" do not apply.

        This is very confusing.  The language suggests that it is possible
to identify generic types of behavior that are "private" and other types
that are "public" and that there are institutional spheres (the
institutions of family, friendship, and intimacy) that are "private" and
other arenas (government, the media, "the commons") that are public.

        These implications are, to my mind, erroneous.  The family is an
eminently public institution, and is regulated by public laws regarding
marriage, divorce, taxation and inheritance.  A great deal of behavior
that goes on at home and even in the bedroom--incest, wife-battering and
child-abuse, to name the obvious--is clearly a matter in which the public
and its expression in the governmental system takes an interest.  The same
is true of drug-use and marriage out of wedlock, which are matters of
public concern, tied as they are to the legal system and the family as an
institution.  The violent fantasies experienced in "road rage" are
presumably "private," but if they express themselves in aggressive and
destructive driving behavior they become "public" because they constitute
violations of public rules of the road and sometimes public criminal
codes.  There is much that is "private" about educational
institutions--for example, the confidential relations between teacher and
student--but there are "public" rules that guarantee that privacy, and
there are many aspects of educational institutions (truancy, student
misconduct, classroom disruption) that become matters of "public" interest
on the part of those institutions and sometimes on the part of legal
authorities.

        My conclusion from these illustrations is that it is not possible
to identify, generically, discrete types of behavior (drug-taking),
discrete institutions (family, friendship) or physical spaces (bedrooms,
"the commons") that are, in and of themselves, distinctively private or
public.  Almost any kind of behavior can be regarded as public or private,
depending on circumstances and arrangements.  The ideas of private and
public are better represented, rather, as behavior (and sometimes
attitudes) in which some larger collectivity does or does not have a
(legitimate) interest.  This means that there are public and private
aspects of specific kinds of behavior, of different institutions, and of
geographical spaces.  "Public and private" is thus a distinction that
pervades and cuts across concrete social behaviors and forms.

        Given this circumstance, to identify "public" and "private" is
thus not to point to concrete social "things" or "spheres," but rather to
treat the the distinction as a continuous process of negotiation,
disputation, and conflict--in a word, as process rather than thing.  Most
discourse about public and private is in the nature of conflicting
definitions of what constitutes the legitimate claims of collectivities
(the state, the law, the corporation, the public bureaucracy, the
educational institution) and what is to be excluded from these claims.  To
press this insight further, the very definition of public and private is a
matter of normative claims and normative agreement or disagreement.  To
recognize this changes our thinking when we try to come up with
definitions of what is public and what is private.

Normative standards

        Our ideas about norms also call for some clarification, because it
is a common (and misleading) practice to conceive of norms as definite
rules that regulate definite items of behavior.  The phrase "behavioral
norms" as it appears in the summary of the June 12 meeting is a
manifestation of that conception.

        In my own thinking about norms--which are, as you know, the
stock-in-trade of sociologists--I have always found it helpful to
disaggregate the unitary conception of "norm" and to identify several
dimensions along which norms may vary.  Among these are the following:

        Obligatory vs. optional.  As part of the role of professor it is
obligatory--or at least we used to think it so--for him or her to show up
for classes that he or she has scheduled to teach.  It is also a norm that
he or she show up for commencement ceremonies, but that norm is more of an
optional character, not really carrying any explicit sanctions if one does
not do so.

        Specific vs. general.  Most criminal laws define specific
actions--arson, kidnapping, rape, murder--as the target of the law.  Other
kinds of norms are widely inclusive, open, and ambiguous as to what kinds
of behavior are to be included--"honor thy mother and father," "drink like
a lady," "behave like a gentleman," "be a good boy," "do the right thing,"
and--for our purposes--"be civil" and "don't be rude."  For the latter
types of norms, much discourse and conflict concerns what should be
included or excluded from the general umbrella.

        Prohibitive-positive.  Most of the criminal laws mentioned under
the previous heading prohibit certain actions.  So do many of the
commandments that begin "Thou shalt not."  Other kinds of norms call for
performances.  One criminal law, called "misprision of felony," requires
that a witness to a crime report it to the authorities.  Many norms
regarding "manners" also call for the performance of specific actions
(setting the table in the correct way) but some are prohibitive as
well--"don't belch at the table"--though in some other cultures belching
at the table is a positive exhortation.

        These distinctions lead us to think in more complex and realistic
ways about norms, sanctions, and behaviors.  It also leads us to think
more intelligently about phenomena such as "fundamentalism"--which is
frequently characterized by obligatory, specific norms that are both
prohibitive and positive, and "liberalism," which leans more in the
direction of optional, general, and positive in its normative repertoire
(cf. the formulation coming out of the French enlightenment--behavior is
acceptable unless it constitutes harm or danger to others).

        It is often the case that when a group or groups of people believe
they perceive a deterioration or weakening of the moral order an obvious
first temptation is to think in terms of prohibitions of an obligatory
sort of specific kinds of behavior--the ban on hate speech is an example,
and thinking in terms of regulating what kind of material should be
permissible on television or on the internet are other examples.  Such
prohibitions almost always prove to be unsuccessful, because "civility" as
a phenomenon is a rich mixture of norms, mostly exhortatory and not
obligatory, mostly general and not specific with respect to concrete items
of behavior, and often positive rather than negative.  The inevitable
result is that when specific, negative normative regulations are imposed,
most of people's energy is dedicated to pressing the rules and fighting
over what kinds of behavior are to be included or excluded from them.
Hate speech again is an example, as is the long history of unsuccessful
efforts to prohibit pornography.  I am not arguing that these arenas are
not matters for legitimate normative concerns, but I am arguing that we
often approach them with mistaken notions of what kind of normative
situation is at hand.

        Well, my main point about private/public and about normative
regulation is that we get a lot further in our understanding if we keep in
mind the kinds of distinctions that I have laid out.  I hope, furthermore,
that I can persuade members of the working group to spend at least a
limited portion of our time and effort thinking along such lines, because
in my own mind this line of thinking can lead us further in understanding,
phenomena such as absolutism, relativism, fundamentalism, and intolerance,
and in understanding exactly what is involved in norms of public/private,
inclusiveness/access, and equity/fairness, all of which are included in
the types of norms that the working group wishes to be included in its
list of concerns.

        I will conclude this memorandum by making a few unrelated points:

        (1) Though the name of the working group has given up its title of
"Culture of Intolerance," I think it is a phenomenon on which we should
focus.  One reason it is so important is because it is so intractable and
because it serves such a diversity of personal, social and cultural
functions, such as the channeling and symbolization of personal conflicts,
the comfort of "agreeing on things" in personal interaction, the joys of
gossip, the solidarity of sub-groups, etc.  It is essential to understand
it in all its aspects if we are going to consider norms and normative
measures that might affect public behavior.

        (2) In addition to "norms" as sources of regulations, we also have
to think about general values which give (or fail to give) legitimacy to
norms, and the wide range of sanctions--both formal and informal--that
typically gives norms their "bite" in specific situations.  We should also
think of "mechanisms" by which general, optional, and positive norms gain
their force--for example, through role-modeling.  All this would take us
away from an unduly narrow focus on  specific norms as they relate to
specific behavior.

        (3) In discussing the distinction between absolutism and
relativism of norms, we should not forget to note that radical relativism
can be disguised absolutism.  I have always found it profitable to think
of some strands of postmodern thinking in these terms.

        (4) With respect to division of labor among working-group members
and staff, I do not have too much novel to say.  I believe that the staff
could take a large and responsible role in reviewing literature relating
to intolerance, multiculturalism, relativism, racial and ethnic conflict,
and the norms of public behavior.  That role could extend to identifying
new arenas and problems for future research, though I am certain the
working-group will be interested in these topics as well.  I do not know
what understanding you have about primary drafting responsibilities for
working-group reports, and there are of course many ways of handling this.
Speaking only for myself, I think I would like to be involved rather
closely in this process.  My thinking on this issue of division of labor
is fairly abstract at this point, and I would very much like your
suggestions.

        (5) The idea of comparative reference to the ways in which
normative rules and regulations are treated in other national and cultural
contexts is a very helpful one to pursue, though recommendations to adopt
or incorporate--in a wholesale way--normative arrangements from other
contexts is to be guarded against.

        I should bring this commentary to an end.  I believe I have
responded to many of the elements in the summary of the working group's
first meeting.  I would like whatever reactions you have, and whatever
suggestions you have about sharing some of these ideas with the sub-group.

MEMORANDUM

Date:   August 25, 1997

To:     Members of Working Group on Culture of Behavior, Penn
        National Commission

From:   Neil Smelser

        At the end of last week I sent you what I hope was a clarifying
memorandum on the work of our committee, which will be to focus on the
culture and behavior of phenomena that fall under the heading of civility,
tolerance, and, more generally, acceptable public conduct.  In this letter
I pose some more particular questions to you, and ask you to reflect and
communicate on them.  These questions arise out of my memorandum dated
August 22, Bob Wiebe's memo dated July 1, and the notes summarizing the
June meeting of the working group.  Here are the questions:

        (1) How do we conceptualize properly the difference between the
"public" and "private" spheres, if indeed they are concretely identifiable
spheres?  I made some preliminary remarks on this in my memo, but  regard
them as preliminary, and much in need of clarification, extension, and
elaboration.

        (2) One upshot of my memorandum was that we not focus so much on
norms as on other mechanisms affecting civility and related phenomena.
This echoed Bob Wiebe's earlier sentiment.  I argued that much of what we
refer to in civil society and discourse is not properly regulated by
specific and obligatory positive or negative norms.  Civil and tolerant
behavior seems as much a matter of fostering attitudes, outlooks and
understandings that result in specific behaviors as it does in the
detailed monitoring of those behaviors.  If that is the case, then what
mechanisms (other than legal and other norms) are to be
identified--socialization, education, organizing participatory life at the
local level, institutional leadership, responsibility of crucial media
such as the press, or others?

        (3) Bob Wiebe suggested we focus on tensions in American society
as more than norms as such.  He mentioned (a) the pull between civility
and voice (b) the pull between reasoned and expressive exchange; (c) the
pull between personal claims and collective restraints; (d) the pull
between privacy and engagement; (e) the pull between normlessness in
constituting the pubic and value-based exclusions/condemnations
restricting it; (f) the pull between buying public messages and
guaranteeing their transmission; (g) the pull between efficient resolution
and maximum participation.

        We will no doubt want to revise and refine his views, but they are
clearly relevant.  Furthermore, I would add that the resolution of these
tensions is only in small part a matter of practical compromise.  These
tensions stand as permanent, established ambivalences and dilemmas, never
finally resolvable and bound to appear and reappear in different contexts.
For example, we have (at least) two principles inherited from the French
Revolution--libert*, or the negation of government intrusion on behavior
that is not harmful to others, and la patrie, or the principle that the
nation is the prime if not the exclusive focus of territorial control,
economic self-sufficiency, common culture (including language),
solidarity, loyalty and personal identification.  While we have embraced
both these principles absolutely, they constantly and in different ways
pull in opposite directions.

        The emergent question is this:  if our collective effort is to
mediate tensions among contrasting and contradictory tendencies rather
than to identify and implement absolute values, then how does this affect
our approach to the culture and behavior of civility and tolerance, both
of which a frequently themselves regarded as absolutes?

        (4) All that being said, is it more appropriate to focus on
phenomena such as civility and tolerance as such, or to treat them more as
benign products of underlying cultural, social-structural, and
social-psychological forces?

        (5) All of the above questions are analytic, and legitimately so,
for if we are to carry out our common resolve to seek new problems,
provide new diagnoses, and look toward productive solutions, we need to be
as analytically correct and precise as possible.  That being said, we also
have to make the transition between analysis and diagnosis on the one hand
and positive recommendations (public policy, institutional arrangements,
right practices) on the other.  What is the best way for our working group
to make this transition?  What forms should "recommendations" (if any)
take?

        These questions are meant to stimulate.  I would ask that you,
members of our working group, respond to them, in the way you feel is
best, in the next few days, sharing your responses with all of us.
Furthermore, I am certain that these questions do not exhaust the thinking
of any of you with respect to the issues involved in our collective task,
the ways of proceeding with these issues, and the way we organize our work
and schedule generally.

        I believe you have all been informed about the logistics of our
list-serve, but Stephen Steinberg has offered to be of help if necessary.

We should distinguish between remote explanations, which

crime--and proximal explanations, like cognitions of hopelessness,
which can often explain more of the variance. We should aso
distinguish structural explanations, like econmic inequality, from
explanations in terms of other people's minds. I think those psychological
explanations are often illuminating. If they are not, I don't
think the psychologists on the commission can be of much help.

Subject:      Private liberality for public benefit

Working Group on Culture of Behavior, PNC
From:   Edna Ullmann-Margalit


Hi all: here is my own response to Neil Smelser's memorandum "Getting
rolling" (Aug 22) and to his "Call for input" (Aug 25) - for what it's
worth. (I'm finding this exciting!)


The philosopher Peter Geach once said, famously: "I certainly could not
define either 'oak- tree' or 'elephant'; but that does not destroy my
right to assert that no oak-tree is an elephant." I agree that it may be
futile to attempt to come up with definitions of what is public and what
is private: as Neil Smelser puts it, "almost any kind of behavior can be
regarded as public or private." Yet let us not lose sight of the fact that
we do have strong intuitions - culturally dependent and normatively
shaped, to be sure - about the private/public distinction, and about
many cases of behaviors which we consider to be clear cases belonging  to
one category and not to the other. Let us build on these. A good way to
begin is to go along with Neil Smelser's own conclusion that almost any
kind of behavior has aspects which may be private or public, and to
resolve to focus on the public aspects of behavior.

I agree that our task is to think about how to encourage/foster/reinforce
both general attitudes and specific behaviors having to do with "civility
and related phenomena," that these are "rich mixtures of norms," and,
further, that the norms involved are mostly exhortatory, general and
positive (to use Neil Smelser's language and taxonomy). I also like, much,
the list of tensions, or "pulls" (mentioned by Neil Smelser, summarizing
Bob Wiebe) in our society - e.g. between reasoned and expressive
exchanges, or between personal claims and collective restraints - and
wish to endorse the idea that these are not so much to be thought of as
conflicts to be resolved but rather as ambivalences we have to learn to
live with and had better come up with ideas how.

Now given all this, and given my trust that the notions of tolerance,
absolutism/relativism, fundamentalism, fairness/equity/justice,
exclusion/access (and more) are going to get a good and relevant airing by
the members of our working group, I'd like to throw into our discussion a
bunch of new concepts, and thereby (hopefully, as far as I'm concerned) to
take our discussion off on a somewhat different tangent.

To me the idea of fostering civility-related attitudes and behaviors
includes, inter alia, the classical mode of benefaction referred to as
*euergetism*, or magnificence. It is the pre-charity mode of doing good
for the city/community: private liberality for public benefit. The
notables who exercise euergetism are not concerned with the needy, but
with public works and public goods. They belong to a culture of
public-spirited conspicuous giving, forming part of a gift economy which
may run parallel to a market economy of supply and demand. Historically,
secular euergetism, which is associated with the pagan Graeco-Roman
aristocratic morality, and pious charity, which is associated with the
Judeo-Christian morality that replaced it, are worlds apart. Still, the
important idea that lies behind both - and that I believe we ought to
focus on - is the deep conviction that one ought not to claim everything
that is rightfully one's own. - This is one helpful way of getting beyond
the narrow perspective of rights, when thinking about the private/public
spheres.
     Euergetism, charity and philanthropy can be thought of as voluntary
mechanisms for the redistribution of wealth in society. The device,
familiar to us all, of tax deduction is an instrument in the hands of the
state for purposes of redistribution, an instrument which leaves the free
market intact - tying up some public money while engendering several-fold
private contributions for public, social and cultural purposes. Social
scientists speak of 'the ineradicable element of altruism' in people's
behavior. The phenomenon of altruism confuses economists, at the same time
as it is documented by anthropologists and confirmed by everyone's
personal experience. I believe we ought to think about altruism and about
ways to foster altruistic behavior: the model of tax deduction may
encourage us to think creatively about other types of devices that may
foster private altruistic behavior for public benefit.
     A final point: I would like to put to you the view that the character
of a culture is determined, in part, by the use the society makes of its
surplus. ("Religious societies build cathedrals with their surplus,
secular ones build nuclear power stations or fly to the moon.") Western
societies produce an enormous amount of surplus which is in private hands,
whether or not the state as such is rich. Ultimately, our own culture will
be judged by the use we make of our surplus: higher education and basic
science, elite culture and progressive social change, public works and
buildings, human rights and minority rights - these are some of the causes
where private behavior can make a difference for the better. I am making a
plea, then, for us to come up with ways to help make our society revive
the ethos of euergetism, and of the human ideal-type it fosters, that of
the public spirited patron of public life. I suggest that it is with
respect to thinking about such issues that we as academics may have a
relative advantage.
