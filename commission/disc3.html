CASS SUNSTEIN:  Many thanks to both of our presenters for informative and
provocative--actually, my reaction to the last one is surprisingly
provocative--and really wonderful comments.
Maybe  I'll just make one brief notation, of a University of
Chicago sort.  Which is that there is a commonality in the two
presentations,
which is that they are both about responses to market incentives.  So
Paul's
presentation was really about the imperatives of candidates whose job it
is to
win, and the best way to win is sometimes to produce a scandal.  And
David's was, very clearly, the response to the incentives that newspapers
and
other cultural producers face--the economic incentives they face.  And the
two
possible responses to market incentives that are going sour are norm
change
and law change.  And David, I guess, was talking about both, so...
<p>
JOYCE APPLEBY:  Well, I'm reluctant to defend these shows, and
yet, I think it might be worthwhile--just examining some of the
things that went before in our culture that might have encouraged people
to
talk about their lives.  I'm thinking of consciousness-raising.  It was
somewhat important in the 1960s; assertiveness training, I think, came
along
in the '70s; we certainly had encounter groups--they were very important
all
through this period; and now, of course, in the last two decades, we've
had
these 12-step recovery programs, or self-improvement programs.  There's a
great literature in self-improvement.
<p>
And I wonder if we shouldn't just consider the possibility that a lot of
people who have never been reflective at all about their lives are
beginning
into the path of deliberation and reflection by thinking about themselves
in
these new ways, with this pop psychology vocabulary, but nonetheless, that
there is some meaning, a genuine experience reflected in this.  I
appreciate the vulgarization that's taken place and the commercial
incentives
to exploit it, but I don't think that we should treat it in a vacuum, this
penchant for exploring one's life and trying to understand these
conflicts and experiences--and they're all in the material of Greek
tragedies--that are being investigated.
<p>
There is some meaning there.  There's some human meaning there in that
experience.  
And so I don't want to defend these awful shows, but I, nonetheless, 
think that we ought to keep that in mind before we, you know, rush to have
censorship programs or self-censorships, or groups of censors revaluing
norms--public norms.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  David. <p>

BROMWICH:  Yeah, most of the precursors of them, the mores
exemplified by the programs that you named, all except maybe
consciousness-raising in its early feminist phase, I loathe as much as I
loathe the programs.  But I wouldn't deny that for some people who 
have been stifled or in some serious way repressed from speaking--
I mean, actually repressed, not culturally conditioned, though
I agree the two can overlap--for some, speaking at all in this context, if
it
is the first time they speak, can be a liberation.
<p>
I have to claim, with a rueful feeling, perhaps greater expertise than
some
in this room about the shows.  I've watched maybe six to 12 hours of them
in
my life, and I suspect most of you have watched zero to six.  It really
isn't the testifying Quaker Meeting or early Christian sense
of the unwashed, the inarticulate finally coming to say something, at
least,
about themselves, which I think, from an outside and charitable view, one
can
have.  It isn't that sense you get on these shows.
<p>
The people are very articulate, often.  They're habituated to this
kind of talk.  And what they are most exemplifying and learning to see as
legitimate is the idea that private matters can be talked about to
everyone,
and that the way to solve problems of relationships is to broadcast them.
Now
that would be another discussion, what we make morally, politically and
civically of those ideas, but those seem to be the prominent ideas of the
shows, that matters of privacy can be frankly dealt with,
most of all, before the widest possible audience.
<p>
There's a lot of grinning and strutting, and great fun and showmanship
among
both men and women on these shows, too, of all ages.  There's another
precursor show called "Queen For a Day."  My grandmother used to watch it.
Needless to say, at the age of six I had no taste for such things.
<p>
ROCHELLE GURSTEIN:  These shows also have the sense
of being freak shows. I mean, they're therapeutic and
just as David Bromwich described them, and that's what they're
like.  But there's also the sense that they're the 20th century version of
a
circus, and of displaying people who are very much hurt by being put in
these situations, like the man who murdered the man who expressed his, you
know, his secret crush.  So I think that the people on them are often
being
really exploited.
<p>
I mean, I've watched about, probably, the six to 12 hour, maybe more,
category, and it's so shocking what these people will say
and how hurt they are, and how the producers are exploiting them.  So I
don't think that they're even at the level of self-help, so many of them.
I
mean, I don't know where they get the--and I used to think, when I first
saw them, they were scripted, that no one could possibly do this; that
they
were being paid to do it.  And now I don't think that.  I think they're
really
pathetic, pathetic people who are being horribly exploited.
<p>
And then, if you watch these things, there's this quality that you're
being
exploited, too, and also that it's really hurting our whole public
discourse.
What David Bromwich described as the way that's translated into our
political
discourse, I think, is really true and very, very harmful.
<p>
MICHAEL PIORE:  Well, I'm just going to ask about it--I mean, what's the
connection to soap operas, to Alcoholics Anonymous, to a whole set of
other phenomena in the culture that border on this and lead up to it.
<p>
I'm awe-struck by jumping to the notion of censorship or even
taxation of a phenomenon--of this phenomenon. Where would it stop?  I
mean, 
I grant you that it's not an attractive manifestation of the culture,
but on the other hand, it's related to so many other things
that it seems like you're kind of attacking the symptom rather than
thinking about the underlying [cause.] <p>

BROMWICH:  Sometimes attacking symptoms can be good.  I would not
want to be seen as having, here, advocated any form of censorship.  What I
was
talking about, at the end, was kinds of moral and political suasion that
could
prompt a much stronger self-regulation than now exists.  And I would turn
the
question around--not on you, in particular, but on those who share your
and my
fear of censorship.
<p>
Shall we stop with the helpless feeling that this kind of theatricality
just
runs very deep in the American character?  Sure, it's gotten worse, but
we've
seen it all around us in the religious sects and so on since the
beginning.
Or shall we say that when, you know, one presidential candidate in one
election talks about his partly abused childhood and his difficulties with
his
father and mother in a speech on receiving the nomination, and the
candidate
of another party, completely against his previous personality, starts
talking
about his war wounds in every other speech--shall we say that a
qualitative
change has come about, and we would like to push the change back in the
other
direction?
<p>
I ask that as an open question, but I'm talking about suasion of a sort
that could lead to self-regulation, not about censorship.  Although,
the question, for instance, of the crossing of sadism with pornography, 
that particular thing, I'm not sure I'll go all the way against
censorship.  
But that's not a particular subject of this talk, and it shouldn't be
brought in again by me, anyway. <p>

KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON:  David, I think, in fact, that many of these talk
shows
are doing something that you're asking us to find a place to do.  And
that is, to find a venue in which we can express our being shocked about
something, and can provide a cultural context in which the community
reinforces its more traditional sense of the appropriate norms of
behavior.
<p>
I mean, my sense of the structure of these is that you take something
outside
the boundary, you set up a formula by which the talk show host mediates
the
conventional morality through the intercession of the audience,
whose job it is, in the narrative structure, to say, `Why did you do
that?  That's shocking.  How could you treat the person this way?'  And
the
person's role is to recognize that they've now deviated from the
conventional
morality and they're supposed to come back in.
<p>
But the formula will fail periodically.  And then you get these instances
in
which, you know, the young man doesn't recognize that he's supposed
to be tolerant toward someone who has a gay crush on him, and as a result,
the
formula begins to spin out of control.  Or you get an instance in which
you overstep and you get into voyeurism, in which the audience is
uncomfortable and the audience doesn't react and play its part through, or
the
host doesn't mediate carefully.
<p>
But I think that one of the characteristics, structurally, of this is that
element built into the plot structure to express shock, outrage and what
the
appropriate boundaries are of behavior within conventional morality.
<p>
LAWRENCE LESSIG:  I think I share, David, your latter, sort of
sense that we shouldn't just take it as given to us the consequences
of a certain technological and market set of incentives.  If it turns out
that
the technological and market set of incentives yields a public discourse
that
for some reasons we want to criticize, we should do things to
change it.  I think that is an important idea to keep in the foreground.
We shouldn't be sort of trapped by the invisible hands of these
market forces and whatever seems to make sense for industries to
profit off of this speech.
<p>
On the other hand, it does seem to raise an extremely difficult
empirical question about just what it is we're observing and what the
distribution is of what we're observing.  I'm taking I think,
Professor Jamison's point is a good one if--I mean there's, first of all,
an ambiguity in what we're seeing.  Ambiguity of whether this is enforcing
moral norms or whether this is, in some sense, debasing them.  I fall into
the
category of people who have no idea about what this stuff is at all, so I
confess my ignorance about this.
<p>
But it's a question that we need to find a way to figure out which of
these
two interpretations is the better.  And the second is a sense of
empirically, 
what is the distribution of this kind of discourse
that's out there?  I mean, I know that there's the freak shows, just
because I
hear about it.  I mean, I hear about it on news reports, and I know about
this particular incident about the killing of the admirer.
<p>
But I also [find] what's interesting about the relationship between
this panel and the previous one is that at least the form of  discourses
fits 
with something we were talking about before, which is
something like the deliberation of a focus group.  I mean, I've seen
some -- at least topics of some of them -- which were about normative
questions
that ought to be discussed publicly.
<p>
And so here you have a group of people who are addressing a normative
question
that ought to be discussed publicly.  They're forced to take on reason
from
one person to the other.  It seems, on the face of it, that should be
constructive.  And if the distribution of this stuff were such that 50
percent
of it or 60 percent of it really was of public issues that really ought to
be
discussed publicly and did have this nature to them, then one wouldn't be
so
concerned about them.  And if it had the effect of reinforcing norms
that we believe are good, then one wouldn't be so concerned about them.
<p>
So I wonder if you can formulate a research agenda that tries to
figure out whether this is really a problem?  Because if it is as you've
described it, maybe it is, but I think you've been quite up-front about
not really having a sense of what the distribution is, such that we would
know
whether it's a problem. <p>

BROMWICH:  I don't want to get us off the exciting topic I've broached
after all of daytime TV.  But the point connecting the different parts of
my
sketch and connecting it, perhaps, with Paul Begala's also, was what I
spoke of as the reversal of relation between authority and constituency,
the feeling that any use of authority that doesn't incorporate at every
stage
deference to the constituency is illegitimate.
<p>
And this gets back to what I take to have been a theme running through two
or
three conversations today already.  Namely, you know, what would a
culture more adequately equipped than ours now seems to be for
deliberation be
like in its attitude toward legitimate authority?  I'll have to dismiss,
from
my view, these shows just by saying I think they tend tremendously to
corrupt
people's intuitions about authority in moral matters, simply by their
destruction of privacy right there on stage.
<p>
But that is a psychological, I would concede, intuition.  There are some
psychologists who are sharers in it, whom I could name, but it is not
empirical, and I can't give you a research program.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Professor Eron.
<p>
LEONARD ERON:  I think your intuition is supported by the data.  There
are lots of data, and I'll talk about some of them tomorrow, which do,
indeed,
show there is influence on behavior of watching these programs.
<p>
Joyce Appleby started this discussion by talking about different forms of
therapy--so-called therapy--which indicate that this is something
that's done a lot.  Well, these forms of therapy, however, are done in
private.  There is an interaction between a patient and the psychiatrist
or
psychologist, social worker; often, perhaps, there may be group therapy,
in
which there are six or seven persons; someone mentioned Alcoholics
Anonymous,
where there are larger groups.  But these programs are carried out before
millions of viewers.  It's quite different from therapy.
<p>
And the terrible thing about this is that these programs are being
watched by little children, two-year-olds, three-year-olds,
four-year-olds,
many hours a day.  And this cannot help but contribute to the way
youngsters
look at the world about them, the norms that they establish for behavior.
They get to think that this is a usual thing, this is the way most people
act,
when we know it's not, but little children do not know this.  They cannot
distinguish reality from the fantasy, or whatever it is, that they're
hearing
and seeing on television.  And I will talk about this some more tomorrow.
<p>
MARITN SELIGMAN:  I want to comment on three related things:  First, I
want to talk about the notion of shared experience and why it's an
interesting
psychological notion.  And then I want to say something about what I think
underlies the symptom in daytime TV.  I want to talk about victimology for
a
moment.  And then I want to try to associate, to a general point, about
the
virtues of civility--or one virtue of civility. <p>

I want to begin by applauding what Professor Bromwich said by talking
[about] a
narrowly technical point in psychology, the use of shared experience and
where
it originates. By and large, the reason therapy developed shared
experience in private was to create a comfort level and rapport so one
could
then go on.  When you have shared experience, that's a situation that
leads to expansiveness, to comfort, to trust.  And then one goes on to do
hard
deliberative work about ideals and duty and how life should go on from
there.
Now shared experience, in itself, I think the evidence is, has no
therapeutic
effect other than that.  That is, catharsis about reliving sexual abuse
probably doesn't do anything.  It gives you a temporary glow like
exercise and 36 hours later you still have the drug problem, the
alcoholism
problem and the like.  But what you do, as a therapist, when you do this,
is
to create an atmosphere in which much more important stuff can then
happen.
<p>
So I think, David, what I want to say is that the form itself is a very
debased and deformed form of therapy.  I wouldn't want you to call it--now
I'm
speaking, I guess, as president-elect of the American Psychological
Association--I really wouldn't want you to call this therapy.  This is
pseudo-therapy at its worst. <p>

Now why is this so appealing? I think it's not just a freak show, and
it's not just voyeurism and it's not just entertainment.  I think it has
roots
in an ideology which has become more and more current in America, and
that's
victimology.  That for a very interesting set of reasons, we've become
tolerant and celebrating of being a victim.  And I think that ideology is
an
ideology with teeth, and an ideology which we should worry about.
<p>
Let me just take one case.  I'm quite interested in the effects of sexual
abuse in childhood on adult depression and loneliness and sexual problems
and
the like.  And it turns out there's some careful analyses of these things.
And there is little reason to think that the sexual abuse in childhood
experience itself produces these adult effects, but rather it's not being
the victim; it's sort of what the sequela of being the victim are.
<p>
If you look at when the effects of sexual abuse are at their worst in
children, it's when the child has to relive it over and over and over
again in
courtroom testimony, for example.  So reliving it, itself, I think can be
anti-therapeutic.  But worse than that, I think a climate of victimology
has led us to forget about individual responsibility; it's antagonized
notions which [are] in successful therapy, working hard to overcome
problems,
optimism, individual responsibility--those notions are often eroded by
this
victimology mentality.
<p>
The final thing I wanted to say is not unrelated to what
Judy started us with this morning.  And Amy and I were talking at the
break about what are the virtues of civility?  And one of the
virtues--well,
let me put it the other way around:  Incivility, in the sense of being
hostile and threatening, producing anger and defensiveness, is a state
in which your cognitive map narrows.  You feel defensive, it's not a
state conducive to expansive, creative thinking, to being rational about
problems.  It's a state that induces self-defense. <p>

And, conversely, the virtue of civility--I think it's an aid in finding
common
ground.  Civility is a situation in which you're not threatened; you're
not
defensive; rationality, creativity, thinking about the future are more
expansive.  And so I guess I'm returning to shared experience as a
therapeutic
tactic to create a comfort that allows one to go on from there is not
unrelated to what I think a central virtue of civility is, allowing common
ground and allowing one to go on from there.
<p>
MICHAEL USEEM:  This is a little bit disjointed from the previous
comments, which I found extremely interesting.  But let me just go ahead
and
ask the question I was going to ask of Paul and David--very powerful
critique
of the worsening of certain aspects of political and public culture in the
US.
To think, though, about addressing those problems, we sure hope there's
some good developments out there, some parts of the political process or
the
telecommunications era which gives one a sense that there are reasons for
optimism or things we can ride to overcome some of these problems.  So my
question, simply put, is:  What do you see that's good in the last five or
six
years, both in politics and in this public dialogue on public TV?
<p>
BEGALA:  Lots.  For one thing--this is, again, from a partisan
perspective-- the morning after the election, after Bill
Clinton won and he got 60 percent of the vote in New York state, Al
D'Amato,
who presided over 40 Whitewater hearings, stood up and said, `I'm out of
the
Whitewater business.'  D'Amato, in the exit polls, was given the lowest
approval rating of any senator in America.  He decided that it no longer
paid
to play the politics as scandal, and he's now, as chairman of the Banking
Committee, going to look at banking.  I take some heart in that.  The
voters
didn't reward.  It�s been a big mess.  It's costing my friends a lot
of money.  They and Clinton didn't beat Bush because of all of the
nonsense over the scandals that some Democrats were trying to drag up.
Dole
was not able to prevail, so the market, in that sense, is working.
<p>
And on daytime TV, in which I'm not an expert, I do know, as I
appreciate it, the number one and two of these talk shows actually are
Oprah
Winfrey and Rosie O'Donnell, who do none of that.  Oprah, once a month, as
I understand it, has sort of a book club, where she tells her viewers,
`Here's
a really terrific book and everybody should read it.'  And that person is
an
instant millionaire.  So all of you who have books ought to suck up to
Oprah.
<p>
And Rosie O'Donnell has sort of , again, as I understand it,
sort of a celebrity-driven chat show, that is known for its
politeness and civility, and she has rocketed to the top.  And it's not
that
all of these are going to go away.  I wish they would, but the market is
rewarding the types of behavior that, at least, I like.
<p>
BROMWICH:  Let me just say briefly one thing that might seem
counter to the general tenor of my presentation.  There are some
developments
of constituted authority admitting to the public that it's done
wrong in the past that seem to me relatively novel in recent years; that
have
forced me to think hard, and that thinking about, on balance, I've decided
are
very good and very democratic changes of manners.  For instance, the
finding
of the president's commission that there were victims of unadvertised, not
properly described or declared government research on atomic radiation, to
whom the government now felt obliged to respond by reparations in some
sort,
but also with an apology.
<p>
From the point of view of authority, maybe, our current president is too
good at apologizing, but he is good at that.  And I think that's one
change that seems to me positive and that may prove to be lasting at our
moment, for which no single person is responsible, that the relation
between
governments and their agencies and common citizens will make this kind of
reciprocity more likely in the future than it was during the Cold War.
That's
one good thing I can see, that is, nevertheless, part of what I was
describing
in general as a change I have fears about. <p>

DREW FAUST:  What interested me about your presentations was not
about talk shows, so I wonder if I could ask about that, and I think it
relates back to, David, what you were saying about authority and
constituency
and their relationship.  But I'd like to change that formulation a little
bit,
to leadership and constituency, and go back to some of the themes that
Derek
Bok raised this morning, and to ask each of you if there is a possibility
for
leadership in the way you've just described the worlds that you addressed.
<p>
It seems to me that in Paul Begala's world you'd not only have a world in
which the leader is defined by the constituency's definitions and needs
and political expectations, but a world in which no one in her/his right
mind
is going to want to take on a position of leadership unless her/his
pockets
are so deep as to be able to fund lawyers from now till the end of time.
And
David Bromwich, it seems to me, has presented a world in which leadership
is
called for desperately, and yet, his very pessimistic view seems to allow
no
scope for that leadership.  And I just wondered if each of you could say a
little bit about how leadership could figure into your models of the
crisis at hand?
<p>
BEGALA:  First, the bad news.  I wouldn't advise any of you to take a
Cabinet job or one of the, say, top 10 jobs in the White House unless you
were
willing to lose $100,000 in legal bills and expect that going into it.
That
is the way of the world, and that's my candid [view] and it comes
from real-life exposure. <p>

Having said that, there's still great hope for leadership.  I'll give you
a
couple of examples.  Yes, politicians reflect, probably more than we would
like them to; they probably lead less and reflect more.  And, yes, I think
the
technology of public opinion research probably empowers them to do that.
I suspect that it's always been the desire of politicians, and, I bet,
even
before technology empowered them, they did an awful lot of seeing where
the
parade was going and then running around the corner to get in front of it.
<p>
But there are examples.  Clearly, Bill Clinton, in raising taxes when he
promised to cut them, but owning up to that and raising them--he knew he
was
going to hurt himself politically.  Gingrich is not a stupid man.  He
tried to
lead on Medicare in a direction that he knew was at odds with popular
opinion [and]
paid a price for it.  But he was trying to do something that he believed
in, even more than he believed in popularity.
<p>
Here in Pennsylvania, I've got my friend, Harris Wofford, and in
1991 the survey research we did for him, when he was first appointed to
the
Senate--we were in a recession, particularly in this state
and the open-ended question or the biggest problem facing Pennsylvania was
jobs and the economy.  Oh, Wofford had been the secretary of labor and
industry immediately preceding his appointment to the Senate.  Any
standard
politician would have said, `Well, I'll run as the jobs guy because I was
the
labor secretary.'  It's a perfectly plausible thing. <p>

Well, [what] Wofford said, instead, when we got the report back, was, `You
know, I
actually learned something as secretary of labor and industry in this
state,
and that is the biggest problem, in terms of jobs and employment, is the
lack
of health care.'  Health care was at 3 percent in the open-ended response.
More than half were saying economy, but Harris said, `If you want to fix
the
economy, you really have to do something about health care.'  And it was
that
simple and direct and beyond just the four corners of the survey research.
And he led on that, and I think did a good job of putting it on the
national
agenda.  That's leadership, and I was really proud to work for him.
<p>
Mr. BROMWICH:  Yeah, it's a hard and  interesting
question.  I don't think that we're past a time in the history of human
nature in which, you know, the presence of a persuasive character
telling large numbers of people what it is that their
predicament looks like, trying to persuade them to change or in some way
confirm the self-image that they have.  I don't think we're past a time
when
that is important.
<p>
Our ideas of statesmanship--that is, of leadership in politics, are, I
think,
still pretty much derived from an idea of party and the thought that, you
know, the contest of parties and their opinions throws up the charismatic
persons who can become leaders.  But leaders were conceived in the 18th
century, when the drafters of The Federalist papers wrote, as partly
extensions of their party.  There's a saying from Burke's "Thoughts of
the Present Discontents" that I think [is] almost on the verge of
paraphrasing The Federalist that `Virtue will catch by contact as well
as vice.'  And the idea is that there can be a person who is a partial
but quite satisfying, for the moment, embodiment of the virtue of a large
group, such as a nation.
<p>
My thought is that, you know, the possibility of having such people on the
scene hasn't disappeared, though we don't have any--much, to speak of,
now.
That when they come, they will consult the preferences of their
constituency
and take all that into account, but that the idea of mandates replacing
the
duties of representation will not dominate them as much as it does our
current
leaders.
<p>
The single scariest phenomenon of these years that I've found was the
rather
easy, or at least uncritical acceptance of the bloc of the so-called
freshman
class of 1994, who made a contract to have one conscience to share among
73
persons.  Now that goes against any idea of statesmanship that we could
call
constitutional, and yet, that aspect of it was not commented on.  What was
commented on was the fascinating populism of the fact that all these were
rather modest people who had no experience of politics, and, therefore,
were
perhaps incorruptible.  Well, it was Robespierre who introduced the
amendment
to the French constitution that there should be term limits.  So I mean,
I'm
not impressed by that style of populist anti-representationalism.
<p>
And I think I would predict that, you know, if we get such a statesman, as
we
have had in the past, again, so great will be his admiration for Paul
Begala's
ideas that he will give him less business.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  I think that's a good note on which to end.  We have a long
line
of people who haven't been called on, and you have a shared traumatic
experience for which apologies.  It's a tribute to the discussion that
there's such a long line of people who haven't been called on.

I've been asked to announce that there is a Hanukkah celebration in Edna
Ullman-Margalit's room, 704, at 6 PM this evening.  There is reason to
believe...
<p>
Unidentified Man:  Use the microphone.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  I'm sorry?
<p>
Unidentified Man :  Use the microphone.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  I'm sorry?  Oh.  Why weren't you interested in hearing me when
I
was talking about my own ideas about the First Amendment?  Why is it a
party
that generates a microphone request?
<p>
At  6:00 there will be, in Edna Ullman-Margalit's room--that is Room 704,
a
Hanukkah celebration.  And there's a rumor that this will be an authentic
one,
because we have--this is someone from Israel.  And we'll have lots of
opportunity to discuss these and other issues over dinner.  I think we
should
thank the two participants for wonderful presentations, very concrete
presentations, also.
<p>
STEPHEN P. STEINBERG: The bus will meet you at the entrance to the law
school, take you back to the Rittenhouse.  You have about two hours to
relax and freshen up.
And then we will reconvene at the president's house.  And my colleague,
Bill
Boltz, will escort you there and back.
