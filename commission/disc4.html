JUDITH RODIN:  Well, a provocative presentation that argues that market
forces
are corrective and put self-limitations on at least some forms of the
news media; that the mainstream media are reporting in ways that debase
and
confuse the electorate and maybe create a model of a poorly motivated
legislative and, I think, executive branch by comparison.  What do
you think?
<p>
DAVID BROMWICH:  One short comment and then one...
<p>
Unidentified Man:  Can't hear you, David.
<p>
BROMWICH:  One short comment and then a question that Professor
Jamieson may want to answer now or as other questions come,
it may take a longer answer.
<p>
The comment is that I think what I would still find
disturbing and somewhat new, increasing in a way that seems to me
scary, is the inversion of the relationship between authority and
constituency, which seems to me still detectable, still one remarkable
feature, even of that Imus tape that you showed us.  I hadn't seen that
before. <p>

What is amazing is that a president and first lady would invite such a
person
to address them, according to the showbiz convention that's called a
roasting,
which I didn't know had a place in, say, the legitimate or network culture
until recently, and used to be the province of nightclub entertainers
like Don Rickles, practiced on targets like O.J. Simpson on his retirement
from football.  Those are characteristic moments of it earlier.
Now we have a president and first lady being roasted by this very
effective
and sometimes funny but, you know, low garbage satirist.  One can't
imagine
Eisenhower asking Lenny Bruce to speak in such a context.
<p>
I state the extreme, but I think that the regression has been in this
one direction.  Very few American observers, including me, have had
anything useful to say about this, except that it is happening, that
it has a long background somewhere.  The prophetic books that I know  on
this subject
are two by Nathanael West, "Miss Lonely Hearts" and "The
Day of the Locust."  They are great American books and they are among the
few
in our assimilated academic culture that remain underground classics.
You won't find them assigned in classes.  They're too scary.
<p>
They're about the, I suppose, desire by authority to be crucified by
constituency.  And the main characters in both books are mobs.
That's the comment, and comment on it as much as you like, when you like.
<p>
The question is about the sort of division between the first two-thirds of
your talk and the the last third, the first part, as Judy Rodin
summarized, being, I thought, very informative and corrective in a
somewhat
whiggish way--that is, one was being made to see that manners are
doing their work, they're just doing it in a fashion that one has to
be constantly observing, as you are, to pick out and to rise above
the sensation that, perhaps, taste or manners or morals have lost
their corrective power.
<p>
But the end of your talk I found disturbing in  a whole
new way, and that is it brought out the question --I can
see why the legitimate media, to call them that, the networks and big
newspapers, want to keep out the voices of the dregs, of the people
from the bottom these starved, these inarticulate on talk radio and so on.
That's just competition.  And that's as old as  competition in culture is. 
But why have the legitimate media so taken on the role of delegitimating
government,
as you report that they do, by increasing the emphasis on attack, 
decreasing the emphasis on both comparison and advocacy? <p>
<p>
What is this a function of?  When did it start happening?  I don't
remember it as a constant feature of the way in which government goings-on
have been reported in my lifetime.
<p>
JAMIESON:  Derek is actually working on this, as we are, so why don't
you give him a chance to talk?
<p>
DEREK BOK:  Oh, I'm not--I was going to ask another [question.]
<p>
JAMIESON:  I thought you were going to answer his question, so I'm...
<p>
BOK:  I was focusing so much on the question I was going to ask, I'm not
sure I quite--could you repeat the question? <p>

BROMWICH:  Why are the legitimate media now, in a way that was quite
foreign to their function and manners even 10 years ago, in the business
of
delegitimating government?
<p>
BOK:  Well, that does tie in.  Let me try to give an answer and then try
to fold 
it into the question I was going to give.  I would say the most obvious
answer is that
the public has become much more negative about government, and they, the
media, being business organizations in a competitive society, deeply
worried
about maintaining their audiences and losing market share, are responding
to the audience.
<p>
So you find two trends in the media, both in television and newspapers:
One
is an increasing percentage of their stories about Congress, for example,
or
the presidency, are negative; and the other trend is that the amount of
attention paid to national affairs, in terms of, say, the percentage of
front-page stories devoted to national affairs, has been going steadily
down.
And that tracks reasonably well with the fact that the public interest in
national affairs has gone down, and the public's view of politics has
become more negative.
<p>
And I guess the question I was going to ask is:  You portray considerable
confidence about the public's ability to draw appropriate lines or some
kind
of reasonable lines about the quality of discourse, and yet, it would seem
to
me--I'm not saying this is inconsistent-- but you're very concerned about
what
the media are doing to the quality of public discourse, but doesn't that
reflect a failure of the public to draw appropriate lines?  Because if the
public were really interested in more substance and less drama,
negativism,
horse-race and so forth, don't you believe that the media would respond to
that? <p>

So what is your overall picture of the role of the public, and in all of
these respects, 
and why does it seem to be able, in your view, to draw appropriate lines 
with respect to one dimension of political speech, but seems to be having
considerable difficulty drawing lines with respect to the overall
presentation of public affairs?
<p>
JAMIESON:  In response to David, the press structure doesn't
simply affect government.  This is a structure through which everything in
public life is filtered.  And so university presidents are perceived more
negatively through the press filter.  There are no longer groups in
society
that are not viewed as self-interested, so [the]American Red Cross isn't
perceived
as non-self-interested; you know, the American Cancer Society isn't.
<p>
The two groups that have survived without having had that tag are the
military, because it has not been controversial, and hence, has not
gotten into the press structure, in a way that lets the cynical structure
wrap around it,
and confidence in the military is still up; and the Supreme Court, which
gets no news coverage,
except for the two or three times a year that it puts rulings down, and at
that point, a very specialized group of reporters come to play, who do
nothing
but court, and they basically write expository stories.
<p>
And so the cynicism data suggests the two institutions are not viewed
cynically or more cynically over time.  And those are the two institutions
that, interestingly, are least likely to be covered by the press
through this as a filter, or covered by the press at all.  And so this
isn't
just press in relationship to government; this is a tendency in the press
that
affects everything the press is covering.
<p>
Why hasn't the public reacted?  The public has.  Those people who are most
likely to perceive that an editor will choose a strategy story over an
issue
story are those who are less likely to be reading and watching right now.
The
press is responding to this, and they're responding in part by endorsing
the civic journalism movement.  The civic journalism movement is coming,
in
part, out of an awareness by broadcast and print outlets that they're not
being able to sustain the audiences that they had once been able to
sustain.
<p>
And as the young audiences are coming into the news arena, they are not
coming
in as high consumers of news, and so one response is a movement within the
journalistic community--Jay is funded by the journalistic community in his
civic journalism work, and that's a systemic response.
<p>
The second response--I'd like to show you a graph that suggests that the
news
media, in fact, are taking seriously the critique that says that strategy
coverage is bad and problematic.  This is your graph across time of
strategy
coverage in presidential campaigns.  This year's strategy coverage dropped
substantially and issue coverage rose proportionately in an environment in
which the amount of news coverage dropped.
<p>
What may have happened was as news coverage dropped, it squeezed out the
strategy coverage.  But what we have is statements by newspapers from
around
the country that they are going to try to create a different kind of
journalism in this year's presidential campaign and, in fact, this would
suggest that at least on that dimension, they did it.
<p>
There's a second tendency, and I didn't bring the chart to show you.
This year, although the negative was still overreported in the 1996
campaign,
the negative is overreported less than it was in the past election.  In
other words, you're beginning to see an audience's response
begin to initiate a self-corrective movement inside the industry, but
you're also beginning to see the editorial norms shift in a way that's
marked
enough that you can begin to pick it up in this kind of aggregate data.
<p>
And I think that's significant, and it is an argument for a problem that
you have in trying to communicate with the news industry.  We, as
consumers, don't have a good way to talk back.  The only way that we can
talk
back is by not watching and not reading, and it took awhile for us to get
that
signal sent into the system.  But by not watching, not reading, we got
their
attention, and they are now trying to respond in ways that are trying to
bring
us back. <p>

I think the other response is talk radio.  People who are high consumers
of
talk radio are also high consumers of all of the other media.  What is
that
telling you?  That's telling you that they're not satisfied that they're
getting what they want from those other media.  But interestingly, they're
not
the hermetically sealed group of yahoos who are, you know, being portrayed
by
mainstream media.  They are very high consumers of mainstream media, and
when
they see mainstream media portraying them as yahoos who are uneducated
when,
in fact, they're more educated, higher income, more likely to participate
in
all forms of politics and more likely to consume all other
forms of news, presumably what that does for them is delegitimizes the
mainstream media, which the mainstream media ought to worry about a lot.
<p>
RODIN:  Bud. <p>

CALVIN TRILLIN:  I think it's a very useful and interesting presentation.
I
would quibble with a few things.  On whether the mainstream media is
trying to marginalize talk radio, and that's why you hear the same
instance.
That may underestimate the role of laziness in reporting, as in
all other disciplines where the guy gets the clips out and merely
writes the same story. <p>

And I think the difference between, as I understand that study, between
negatives 
in speeches and negatives on television.  In fact, stump speeches is not
where the candidates
put forward their negatives.  Those are television ads.  So, I mean, in
a way, they're on the high road, comparatively, in stump speeches.
<p>
I think the difference between the Imus dinner and the Eisenhower era --
In the first place, the way that works is Clinton doesn't invite these
people; the chairman of the press association, of the radio broadcasters
invites
them.  They're all outgrowths of the Gridiron Dinner.  I think the
difference
is not that people wouldn't have done it in that era, but that people
wouldn't
have seen it on television.  They were private.  In fact, the Gridiron
Dinner,
traditionally, wasn't even written about.  This was a time when
reporters went with the people they covered, made fun of each other and
nobody
said anything about it. <p>

This is a custom that's gradually given way.  As these other
dinners have grown up as sort of copies of the Gridiron Dinner,
they've grown up in an era when the separation between public
and private is gradually disappearing, as we discussed yesterday, so that
people probably made fun of Harry Truman, but you didn't see it on C-SPAN;
there wasn't any C-SPAN.
<p>
And I think in a lot of these areas, the big difference is what we see on
television that we wouldn't have seen before.  And I totally agree with
the people who invited Imus--and I know a little bit about that
thing--could
have talked to Professor Jamieson, to start with, and found out that it
was a
mistake before they did it, for the very reason she said; that when you
listen
to Imus, you're ordinarily listening and you know,  [in], Imus' defense, 
he did the same sort of thing, I absolutely agree, that he does on the
radio.  
When you listen to him on the radio, you're alone and he has a crowd
around him.
<p>
In that setting, he was alone and the audience has a crowd around
them.  Most people who listen to Imus are in a car heading from
Connecticut 
toward New York.  If there's anybody with them,
it's the guy they've already confessed horrible things to in the past, so
if he makes a joke that is really in bad taste and his
little claque around him laughs, it's OK for you to laugh.  The reason
nobody
walked out is because the thing that American politicians fear more than
anything else is to be thought of as a bad sport, not a good guy.
<p>
I mean, if you look at--if you have to pick one incident that turned
the corner for Clinton, it was Newt Gingrich complaining that he was
not treated properly on Air Force One, because it's the worst thing an
American politician can do.  So that there's nothing for them
to do except sit there.
<p>
I also would say that if Imus had been funny--consistently funny--it
would have been different.  If you're trying to make a humorous
speech, the first boo you get, you're through, basically.  And it's
very, I think very difficult to recover from that.  I think that
in general, when we're talking about all of this stuff, the question is
what you're trying to get across to people, what a reasonable discourse is
and
what stands in the way of it?
<p>
And I think one of the interesting things about this speech is I
think probably civility isn't the main problem.  But I think of this
whole thing that we're looking at as a matter of continuing the
conversation, as somebody said.  And what's the static that prevents
you from continuing the conversation?  And it's only
possible for me to think--I was saying to somebody today the difference
between reporters and academics is we don't speak--we don't think very
well
in abstract or general terms.  Some people think we don't think very well
at all.
<p>
But when I was a reporter in the South, there was a sort of a yard sale
anthropology among white people in the South about black people,
and that one of the things they always said was they can understand
specific
things, but not abstract things.  And I always said, `Give me an example.'
<p>
And, I mean, for me, the easiest way to think of all this is to
think of arguments in American society or
issues in American society that we could all--let's say we could all agree
on.
The one I was using in conversation last night was when Clinton did his
laundry list of what he was going to do at the Democratic Convention
or as I put it, then, laundry list of tiny garments.  One of the things he
mentioned was that every third-grader should be on grade-level
reading.
<p>
Now this is an incontrovertible argument.  Every study shows nobody could
disagree with the fact that we would all be better off if
every third-grader could read at grade level, and it seems to me that the
problem that we're addressing is what gets in the way of trying to talk
about
that in a reasonable way? <p>

If you try to do that, there would be a huge outcry from people
who believe that teaching reading in any way other than phonics was a plot
by the left-wingers.  There'd be a huge argument about whether to teach
Spanish-speaking kids to read in Spanish and let them transfer.
There would be an argument about the teachers' union.
<p>
These things seem to me more of a problem--and I don't mean everybody
shouldn't have a right to have an opinion than whether or not people
are negative or not.  I mean, the fact that people seeing things in an
agenda--
I would say that the real problem with the press is not negative or
positive
reporting, but horse-race reporting.
<p>
It seems to me the reason the press concentrates on
strategy is two reasons:  One, Watergate:  Everybody, I think--since
Watergate, every reporter is afraid of being a sucker.  And you have to be
tough; you have to show what the real story is.  And the second reason is
that
what used to be the role of The New York Times is now played by ABC
television, which is straight.  This is where most of the people get their
news.  There's instant communication.  Everybody knows what Bob Dole said
in
his speech by 10 minutes after he said it.  And so there's nothing left
for newspapers to do, for instance, except to analyze why he said it.
I mean, they moved on to the next role.
<p>
The other thing I would say, in talking about how much negative coverage
there is, or how much incivility there is, or how we should
concentrate on the issues:  If you voted on the issues, you would have
decided
the 1960 race between Nixon and Kennedy over which one was closer to
your views on Qemoy and Matsu.  This really wasn't a very intelligent
way to cast your vote in 1960, I don't think, and it usually isn't.
<p>
I mean, I think that we've gotten the idea that somehow if we concentrated
on
the issues everything would be OK is a very dangerous idea.  They're going
to
be dealing with different issues.  You really have to sum people up in a
campaign.  That's what a campaign's for, I think.
<p>
The other thing is I think that the Red Cross could use some hard
coverage.  I mean, I don't find anything wrong with that at all.  I
would prefer to think of the press as being skeptical, rather than
cynical, but in fact, I did a story on the aftermath of a hurricane in
Mississippi once, and if there's anything anybody could agree on, is that,
with the possible exception--no, the real exception of insurance
adjusters--the Red Cross was the least popular group you could bring up.
<p>
I mean, there were legitimate complaints, and there's no reason they
shouldn't be looked at the way everybody else is.  I mean, I think that
there's a feeling of good, civic, issue, non-negative, non--or civil that
can get
in the way of what really is, certainly when it comes to the press, a
legitimate role in treating
everything skeptically.  And  I think it's a kind of a trap, if we
start to think if we could just make everybody be nice to each other and
talk
about the issues, everything would be OK.  It really wouldn't be OK.
<p>
JAY ROSEN:  Well, I have a number of things to say, because
Kathleen's presentation was so good and so clear, and thanks.  I
thought it was tremendous stuff.  First of all, on David's question of why
has
there been this change, I would offer a couple of ideas, although Michael
also
should because he's thought about this a lot.  At a certain point, in
the '60s or '70s, I think the notion of heroism in journalism--how to be a
hero in journalism--changed, from some kind of relationship of access and
interpretation of government officials and leaders to their
delegitimation,
and delegitimizing, particularly, public officials, but really all
institutions became, over time, especially through the mythology of
Watergate,
the path to heroism in journalism, the path to excellence, enforced in a
very
specific way through the Pulitzer Prizes and the ways in which the
Pulitzer
Prizes are awarded.
<p>
And so a single model of public service began to dominate in the press,
which
was based around investigative reporting about radical skepticism,
exposure
and the kind of politics of exposure.  And a number of people have written
about this.  That corresponded, in my view, to [an] ever-weakening
bond with an actual public.  So as the professional culture of the press
began
to turn in on itself and produce its own norms of behavior, simultaneously
it
was losing connection to any actual public out there, along with rising
professionalization, rising credentialism, more and more elite people
coming
into--the University people, from Derek�s university coming into the
profession more and more, where they didn't use to before.  More--it
became a
higher-paid profession, much higher status profession.
<p>
And as that occurred, journalists turned to each other and to their
professional culture for rewards, for a sense of self, for a sense of
what's
worth doing.  And within that culture, over time, especially since
Watergate,
delegitimizing everything became the norm, became the way you established
yourself as a successful professional.
<p>
Interestingly enough, that norm was synthesized at the top of the society
in
New York and Washington and then communicated downward in the professional
hierarchy to every journalist in the country so that you had people in
Topeka
trying to do Washington Post journalism to Topeka in order to get to The
Washington Post.  And that's a very interesting sort of professional
culture,
structural sort of arrangement, linking national centers to local centers.
<p>
Now what we have tried to do, in the civic journalism movement, can be
illustrated very clearly.  Kathleen, if you would--could you put that news
norms chart back up there, that you had, that showed how the discourse is
reprocessed by the news media when it takes a look at campaign speeches
and
ads?  Contemporary news norms, Kathleen tells us, argue
for assertion rather than argument; conflict, not consensus or compromise;
attack, not advocacy; expose self-interest of all parties, winning, etc.
<p>
And then she tells us that as discourse gets filtered through the news,
it becomes more hyperbolic, more negative, less likely to advocate or
compare
statements, more likely to attack.  Now this has become a problem, not
only
for us and our kinds of concerns, not only for the political culture, but,
in
fact, it's become a problem for journalism itself, because these practices
are
ruining public trust in the news media, and they are also--could you keep
that
up?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry [to] make you into a technical person,
Kathleen.
<p>
They're also becoming a problem in, as Kathleen mentioned--the audience is
getting pissed-off at this, and the audience is, in fact, drifting away.
It's drifting away drastically at the local level, where you had
newspapers
that once had 75 percent to 80 percent daily readership, would now have 50
percent or 45 percent daily readership.  The young audience is just not
there.
And, increasingly, the audience for network news is drifting away as well.
<p>
And so all of these norms, which are deeply embedded in the professional
culture of journalism, are also deeply dysfunctional for the professional
culture of journalism, which is an extraordinarily important fact.  So
what
we've done, in the civic journalism movement, is come in and work directly
on
what Kathleen labels contemporary news norms and the discourse filter, by
working with journalists to get them to see, first of all, that:  A, they
have
news norms, and they're norms, they're values.
<p>
That's a tremendously difficult act, in and of itself.  That can take five
years to establish, for example, that journalists frame things routinely,
all
the time.  It would take five minutes in an academic discussion.  I have
found
that it takes five years, when you're talking to journalists, to get them
to
admit that, `Yes, we frame things all the time.'  But by now they're
starting
to admit that.
<p>
So we get them to admit that they're doing these things, and a lot of
them,
they sort of realize they're doing.  And then we get them to think about,
well, what could be other news norms?  What could be a different filter?
And
in that effort, we start to bring in this civic thinking, thinking about
democracy, about civility, about public discourse, about what makes for
communication in this society.
<p>
And it's a teaching process, getting journalists to think about those
ideas
and encounter those ideas, and read de Tocqueville and read people like
James
Carey and Michael Schudson and James Fishkin, and Daniel Yankelovich and
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, and actually teach themselves.  And once they do
that,
they realize that there could be other news norms; there could be another
discourse filter.  Then we have to go back to the question of practice,
and
say, well, if we changed those norms, how would that change our practice?
<p>
And than, we use straight Dewey experimentalism.  We don't know how to do
that, and so we just experiment.  Maybe it's like this--no, it turned out
to
be a bad idea.  Let's try something else.  And that's what civic
journalism
is, it's an attempt to question news norms, introduce a civic language and
then ask about practice in an experimental way.
<p>
Now I'm sorry to take up your time, but one more point on this that I
think is
interesting for us, is that in this whole process of questioning news
norms,
introducing the civic language, getting people to experiment, the
participants
are journalists in Wichita, Charlotte, Norfolk, Spokane, at most Kansas
City.
The farthest we've gotten up in the cosmopolitan culture is, like, two or
three people at the Boston Globe, but then it stops, see?  And the
reaction
from that point up in the hierarchy--New York, Washington and everybody in
the
Boston Globe, except those three people, is hostility, and an attempt to
discredit, in my opinion,to discredit the enterprise by calling it, for
example, in the New Yorker a few weeks ago, a fraud, rather than simply
address it as an experiment which has, probably, some good results and
some
bad results, some right turns, some wrong turns.
<p>



The attitude that it's an experiment is to be judged as, you know, a work
in
progress, something that has some good, some bad, which would seem to me 
an eminently reasonable approach, has been totally resisted.  Instead,
the approach has been to attack, attack.  And I think the reason goes back
to
what I said first, [the] professional culture of journalism by now is so
built
around norms of delegitimization, tied to official authority, and its own
bond
with the public is so weak that it can't think of anything else to do but
to
go on in that vein, despite the amount of criticism that it has gotten.
<p>
So I'm very optimistic about the regional press; I'm very pessimistic
about
the elite press, but it seems to me that if the work of this commission
could
clarify what would be more civil or more productive, more useful, more
democratic news norms--which is not a journalistic question; that's a
cultural
question.  If we could do some work on that question, then the work of the
people in civic journalism who are trying to reform what they do would be
that
much easier.  So thank you very much.
<p>
JOEL FLEISHMAN:  Well, I just was going to add another culprit to
help understand why the press has adopted this particular
strategy, and it has to do with public choice political science,
Basically, the public choice theory in political science which
has the doctrine, both that politicians do behave in a self-interested
fashion and that all of their decisions are basically calculated for
personal
gain; and secondly, that they should behave in that fashion.  And
so, properly tutored by public choice theorists, the press have at least
some leg to stand on, with respect to that.
<p>
JAMES FISHKIN:  Yes, but I don't think the public choice political
scientists are that influential.  But there's a germ of truth in
their self-interest.  Actually Kathleen, would you put your chart
back up?  Because what I had planned to say was...
<p>
JAMIESON:  Which one?
<p>
FISHKIN:  That one-- that's the chart.  I want to make a proposal,
and then I have a couple of quibbles.  My proposal, even before Jay had
put
it back, was I wanted to come back to that chart, because he went through
it
in the speed of a 1968 sound bite.  I think that we ought to take, as
one of the main items for this commission, the relationship between the
second
category, contemporary news norms, and the first category, civil
discourse, and think carefully about [them] not quite the way Jay posed
it, �what
would be better norms�, because that has a kind of purely theoretical
character--that question could be taken that way. <p>

I would put the question:  What are the innovations, institutional
innovations' effects on incentives strategically chosen interventions that
have a chance of moving the contemporary news norms and all the things
closer
to what we're calling civil discourse?  That's a way of framing the agenda
of the
commission.  And things like the ad-watch that you've been involved in,
that is a contribution.  The civic journalism movement entirely is a
contribution.  I think, as we think, there will be other things that have
that
effect, and it's not a matter of just saying, `Oh, journalists should
behave
differently,' but a matter of thinking of specific, concrete innovations
and
interventions that would have that character. <p>

So I think, you know, in 90 seconds you did a main part of the work of the
commission.  Now I have two quibbles--they're minor.  I just wanted to say
that there was an implication in the coverage of the
stump speeches that one might have thought that you were saying--I don't
think
you were--that while the candidates are being really substantive, it's
entirely the fault 
of the media that it gets reported this way. <p>

I just wanted to point out what you obviously know, is that
the candidates and their strategists know very well that that, you know,
10-second bit where they attack somebody or they make that charge--that
that's
what's going to get covered, and these are set-piece exercises, where
there's
the audience for the stump speech, but they plant those things that
are going to get on television.  And so they are complicit
in--they're aware of the norms in their implicit--they're complicit and,
indeed, highly strategic in how to get that coverage that they're very
anxious to get.
<p>
Now the other thing I just wanted to say is your question,
about why does the mainstream media consider the talk
radio to be so uncivil?  Well, I think you gave us the answer in the
picture
of Imus, which he characterized as what he does all the time.  And that
was
extremely uncivil.  You don't have to shoot somebody to be uncivil.  
That was extremely uncivil.  It's just the boundaries have moved so far
and one of question
that I would raise about that is the very effect of this--to what extent
there
are these processes where certain norms reassert themselves, and I found
that
absolutely fascinating.  But the question is, how are the boundaries
moving,
and how much further will they move in this general coarsening?  Because
the whole picture of that discourse was by historical -- I mean,
it was uncivil if that is the norm, yes,  shooting may not be the norm,
but if that is the norm, it I
think it would be an interesting question, how the boundaries have moved,
yeah. <p>

RODIN:  ....question on the table... so that we can get a few more points
before we break.  But
you are, in a sense, positioning us for where I do think we want to wind
up.
And one of our questions, I believe, listening to the last day and this
morning will be a question like:  What is reasonable and reasoned
discourse?
What stands in the way of it, and then what can we do about it?
<p>
And that is a sort of paraphrasing in a different way, broadening it, from
just the role of the news media to the role of other institutions in
society, in terms of addressing that.  And I have three or four other such
questions that I think frame the conversation.  Michael, I think you were
next, and then Claude, and then we'll break for a bit.
<p>
MICHAEL PIORE:  Well, I found this presentation and the
discussion which has followed extremely interesting, and the
presentation itself had a structure and degree of complexity and
sophistication that I'm not sure I really have yet absorbed.  But as a
kind of outsider to a discussion which seems to me to be partly an
in[side] one, 
it's an insiders' discussion of a profession.
<p>
I have one comment and one--what I think is a genuine question:  The
comment, in part, goes to Joel's remark about public choice.  It seems to
me
that this strategy or a self-interest way of
understanding behavior is something which is not just peculiar--that is,
its
spread and its dominance is not just peculiar to journalism and the way
journalists understand politics, but has spread very very widely.  That is
one of the--well, I've  always thought of it as the product of the
Reagan era, but perhaps it's not--or of economics as a philosophy.
<p>
But perhaps this goes to something deeper in the culture.  But I
think that we have all come to see everything as much more self-interested
and
that we have lost a vocabulary of understanding things differently, and
that
the kind of academic theories that are fashionable
and that spread outside the academy in American society tend to be
those which reinforce this way of looking at things.  And
I found, although that you, yourself, were using the
self-interested model in explaining the press, and then the question
that occurred to me is, is there an alternative model?
<p>
And to some extent I found this notion of professionalism that Jay laid
out --the question, is what's the relationship between the self-interested
model
and the professional--and a model of professionalism and
spreading professionalism, although in this dialogue, neither one of them
seemed to be doing much for bringing the press closer to a set of ideals.
<p>
And then--so that's--that's sort of a kind of rambling comment.  The
question
is a little different--that is, the way you laid out the structure
of the problem, it seemed like there was a real politics or political
process
underneath, and there was the press reporting it.  And then you focused,
basically, on the press as if that was the way we perceive-- I mean, the
irony was that what had a real impact was the press rather than real
politics.
<p>
And so the question really is partly the result of the way your talk
emerged in this
and the material you had available to kind of flesh it
out.  And so I guess the question is, does the real politics have an
impact that through some other--directly, rather than through the
press or what is the relationship between, quote, "real politics"
and the press, and that goes to the question of the
charge of the commission:  If we think that there's something amiss in
American society--and your presentation calls that perception into
question--but if you do think that there's something amiss, how much
should we
concentrate on the press, and how much is
that going to be a diversion from what's really--or the media broadly--and
how
much is that going to be a diversion from the processes which are really
going
on, underneath? <p>

JAMIESON:  Let me answer in terms of a specific:  During the
health-care reform debate, there were compromised positions that
were shared across the entire legislative spectrum.  There was an
agreement
that we should protect portability, so you should be
able to carry insurance from job to job; we should ban pre-existing
conditions
as a barrier to insurance; and we should provide the advantages of a
market by
providing either voluntary or mandatory purchasing alliances.
<p>
Because the press never featured the areas of agreement across the seven
plans, there was no national consensus.  There was no way to speak [of]
a national consensus when, in fact, every time you asked people in polls
what
they supported, those three things were supported widely by the public and
were supported across the seven plans, because the press never focused on
those areas of compromise.
<p>
When the key legislative players came together to try to affect the
compromise
at the end of the health-care reform debate, they couldn't put it together
because they couldn't show they had a mobilized public.  It took us
another
year and a half to put Kassebaum-Kennedy on the table, which was, in fact,
the
bill that put those compromises into law.  That's an instance in which
real
politics was inhibited by a press structure that didn't let a commonality
that
existed be featured enough to show a mobilized public in support of it,
hence
to drive the legislation. <p>

RODIN:  You're next, Claude.
<p>
CLAUDE STEELE:  Yeah.  I guess I was interested in how broadly you want to
claim the hypothesis you were making, that the
public can-- that market forces will, in a sense, curb incivility
in radio.  And you were using, I guess, as a test of that hypothesis,
the evidence that, in a number of instances radio stations themselves were
willing to censor 
their disc jockeys and their programming and so on.
<p>
But it seemed to me that I thought you were going to say something
differently when you started, which was that the programming
itself would be a candidate for incivility, that they
trade in these kind of, you know, provocative, collective representations
of groups and people and issues and a sort of divisive
kind of discourse that, itself, seems to be a kind of new level
of incivility, so that the background activity
of this programming itself is almost creating a market
or it has created a market.
<p>
And so, thinking that way, I'm just wondering, I guess,
how broadly your confidence is in the
ability of the market to curb this form of incivility.
<p>
JAMIESON:  The problem with the market argument occurs when you've
got an audience that is reinforced by the comments and you don't have an
eavesdropping audience that's offended, and hence, the larger social
audience
never learns about the discourse, and there's no market reaction. <p>

And the worst instance that we found in the study of talk radio was one 
that had not occurred, but it occurred precisely for that reason.
And I'd like to play you that instance, because then you can then make a
judgment of whether, you know, this is or is not something
that should have provoked a response.
<p>
Announcer:  Ken Hamblin, April 16th, 1996.
<p>
 JAMIESON:  African-American host.
<p>
(From tape)
<p>
Mr. KEN HAMBLIN:  We have every right to fight for the dollars that your
brood mares have siphoned off and rob us of a better and improved quality
of
life.
<p>
Unidentified Man on Tape:  But, Ken, who's going to take care of my kids
if they
cut off welfare?  Who's going to provide the affirmative action for my
kids?
<p>
Mr. HAMBLIN:  I'll tell you what--I'll tell you what:  Bring the woman
down
that had your child, let me gut her and remove her reproductive organs...
<p>
Man on Tape:  Excuse me?
<p>
Mr. HAMBLIN:  ...and--and--listen, do you want an answer?  Let me gut her
and
remove her reproductive organs, and I'll support your kids.  And if your
kid
is going to grow up and h--looks like he's going to turn into you, I--I
want
to be able to castrate him and remove his--his genitals, so that he can't
produce and become a burden on society.
<p>
(End of tape)
<p>
JAMIESON:  Now we brought that program to the attention of
the media, and in theory, my model, then, works, because the media then
highlights it.  This is a conservative African-American host.  Reporters
are
very uncomfortable critiquing a conservative African-American host talking
about welfare to an African-American caller in a small media market.  And
so
in those kinds of instances, this system isn't going to work, where
there are other kinds of constraints operating on the discourse.
<p>
RODIN:  Let's take a break.  Kathleen, thank you for a very provocative
session.
