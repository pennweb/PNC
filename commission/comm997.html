Subject:      my message

Dear Task Forcers --   I'm a little perplexed that no one has responded to
the message that I sent early last month.  Should I send it again?  I've
been interviewing the heads of various community-building groups in Los
Angeles and would like to share my thought with you, but first I'd like to
know if my email messages are getting through?  Happy Labor Day!  Joyce

Joyce--

One more thought:  Roger Waldinger in the sociology department at UCLA is
somebody you sould talk to.  He works on immigration and has contacts in
all of the different immigrant comunities, or at least, among people who
study them.  In addition, a group of colleagues in different departments
has been studying the Service worker Internation Union and their justice
for janmitors campaign in LA.

I know Roger Waldinger and will talk to him.  We taught a course together
with other a couple of years ago.  I really like and admire him.  J>

Subject:      PNC Working Group Update

Joyce Appleby has asked me to let all of you know that a piece by group
member Tom Bender has been posted in a new section of our working group's
webpage, "Materials of Interest."  You may reach it by directing your
web-browser to the working group webpage.  The webpage address is:

        http://www.upenn.edu/pnc/commission

You will be prompted to enter the following information:

        username: commission
        password: interact

Find the "Community" listing in the index, and follow the link to Tom's
work from our group's webpage.  You'll also find there an archive of our
discussion to date.

This posting will be followed in the coming days by important articles by
Michael Walzer and Jean Elshtain.  These pieces are designed to serve as
background for the working group's deliberations and should be useful in
generating substantive discussion on the group's listserv.  If you would
like to have something posted, please contact me (boltz@pobox.upenn.edu)
or our Technology Coordinator, Mike Strong, (mstrong@pobox.upenn.edu). 

As Joyce has noted, this group has a marvelous opportunity to conduct
exciting work.  The task before us is large, but manageable.  Joyce will
be contacting you personally in the days ahead to discuss the work of our
group.  If I or any member of the Commission staff can be of any
assistance, as always, please contact us.

Associate Director
Penn National Commission on
    Society, Culture and Community
