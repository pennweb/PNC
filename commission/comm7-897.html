Piece for Civil Society Issue

by

Jean Bethke Elshtain

Jean Bethke Elshtain is the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Professor of
Social and Political Ethics at the University of Chicago and the
author of Democracy on Trial, among others.

 Why civil society? Why now? That we are debating civil society, its
meaning and purpose, is in and of itself fascinating and important.
Civil society as a concept has a long and uneven history. For the
political philosopher, Hegel, it signified a realm of markets and
competition and contract whose divisions would be healed over only
when the citizen entered the most universal of all ethical realms,
that of the state. Civil society, in the Hegelian scheme of things,
is a higher realm than that of individuals and families but
definitely lower in the over-all picture than the more complete and
perfect entity, the state. This European (or, perhaps, more
properly 'Germanic') way of talking about civil society is not what
those claiming the term for contemporary American political debate
have in mind, however. For the most part, civil society in our
context signifies a sphere of associational life that is, yes,
'more' than families and 'less' than states and therein lies
precisely its virtues rather than its defects or inadequacies.
Americans have always been far more suspicious of the state and
concentrations of power at the center than were European
state-makers in the heroic era of state creation and legitimation.

By civil society we have in mind the many forms of community and
association that dot the landscape of a democratic culture, from
families (for we often put the family in civil society, although it
is lodged there rather clumsily), churches, neighborhood groups,
trade unions, self help movements, volunteer activities of all
sorts. Historically, political parties, too, were part of this
picture. This network lies outside the formal structure of state power.

Observers of this democracy have long recognized the vital
importance of civil society thus  understood. Some have spoken of
"mediating institutions" that lie between the individual and
the government or state. These mediating institutions locate each
of us in a number of little estates, so to speak, which are
themselves nested within wider, overlapping frameworks of
sustaining and supporting institutions. One might call this a
densely textured social ecology. This, at least, was--and
remains--the ideal. For civil society is a realm that is neither
individualist nor collectivist. It partakes of both the "I" and the
"we."

Democratic theorists (not all but most) have issued cautions over
the years that America as a democratic culture is perhaps uniquely
dependent upon vital peripheries; reliant on the vibrancy of
political spaces other than or beneath those of the state. These
included, of course, town councils and governmental structures of
all sorts. But the aim throughout was to forestall concentrations
of power at the core or on the top. This is the argument associated
 with Tocqueville in his much cited classic, Democracy in America:
only many small-scale civic bodies enable citizens to cultivate
democratic virtues and to play an active role in the drama of
democracy. Such participation turns on meaningful involvement in
some form of community, by which is meant commitments and ties that
locate the citizen in bonds of trust, reciprocity, mutuality,
competence for the task at hand.

This all sounds good. Too good to be true, argue some critics, who
believe that the current civil society talk is a big evasion, at
best; a pernicious invitation to triumphant localism, at worst.
What is being evaded, on the critics view? The legitimate role of
central government, for one thing, for there are tasks only the
federal government can, or perhaps should, undertake. This
compelling criticism can be addressed and worked out, it seems to
me, by noting the ongoing complexities of our federal system. Take,
for example, the spate of recent Supreme Court decisions which have
had, among other things, the effect of opening the door to a
revitalization of federalism, even state sovereignty or multiple
sovereignties. When I was studying constitutional law in the early
l970s, federalism was considered pretty much a dead letter and
nobody gave a hoot about the l0th Amendment: now it is all the
rage. So the constitution virtually guarantees as an ongoing form
of conflict and contestation such shifting balances of power or
powers. Anthony Lewis, writing in The New York Times, doesn't like
this at all and recalls "willful members of the Supreme Court"
using "strained and rigid readings of the Constitution to strike
down New Deal legislation as beyond Federal power." The Court is up
to nothing less that rolling back history, according to Lewis and
a number of other representatives of the New Deal type of big
government liberalism. For some little government and libertarian
conservatives, on the other hand, the Court hasn't gone nearly far
enough. So this movement back and forth will continue as long as
the American Constitution exists.

The civil society skeptics have other bows in their quiver,
however. The one most commonly shot into the air and aimed more or
less indiscriminately at civil society proponents is what
might be called the Accusation of Nostalgia. I hear it all the
time; indeed, I have an outstanding wager with any and all
interested friends that not a Q and A post-lecture or panel
discussion will go by without at least one (often rather agitated)
member of the audience jumping up to denounce fuzzy-minded
evocations of a "Golden Age" and to remind me of the fact that
there was such a thing as slavery, awful things happened to Native
Americans, at one point women didn't get to vote, and so on. Up
until recently, I responded with a predictable (and honest) set
of caveats: No, this isn't about a Golden Age. Of course, I know
many bad things happened and are happening in America. No, I don't
think local bigots should have a free hand. Yes, I think the Bill
of Rights should remain intact even if their enforcement and that
of subsequent civil rights legislation means the Ku Klux Klan
(which comes up frequently, I find) and others are hauled into
court, and so on.

It strikes me increasingly that my shopping list of caveats is
rather beside the point. For surely my interlocutors know that I
know what they are telling me: that we need a federal government;
that we must sometimes override 'localism' in favor of something
else; that a robust civil society isn't a cure-all and never was.
I have decided that the Accusation of Nostalgia is about something
else, something other than a speaker's lamentable naivete or
tendency to gloss over past wickedness in order to skew an argument
in her favor--which is what I long figured to be the case. It is
about nostalgia. But it isn't mine, or that of other civil society
advocates. Rather, it is a  yearning on the part of the agitated
questioner himself or herself for a world without trade-offs and
limits and political opponents with some clout that challenge the
presuppositions of what might be called triumphant progressivism.

What do I mean? I mean a stubborn refusal to come to grips with the
fact that D.C. centered solutions don't solve all problems or even,
more disturbingly, that not all of our problems are fixable. It
isn't just that one size doesn't necessarily fit all. It is,
rather, a recognition that many of our troubles are troubles that
will plague any huge, late modern, mass, post-industrial democracy.
Civil society isn't so much about problem solving as citizen and
neighbor creating. Then and only then will be work together on
other desired ends.

At one point in the not-too-distant past, it was the case that
those who called themselves progressives embraced the whole Idea of
Progress as our version of the Marxist forward march of history to
a predetermined goal. Things would get bigger and they would get
better. We would become more rational and, as we did so, 'local'
attachments (often called parochial), commitments to family,
religion, and neighborhood (often called backward) would fade. But
that hasn't happened. Not only has it not happened, we are now in
the midst of a reaffirmation and reassertion of particular
identities and commitments by contrast to ways of being and acting
that presume one can transcend such identities and commitments, as
in the classical Hegelian schema. We know that these can take
unpleasant forms. But no civil society thinker wants a world in
which there is only civil society and the federal government or the
whole vast panoply of federal laws and their enforcement has been
repealed. One can make this clear but it doesn't satisfy those
hurling the charge of nostalgia.

But there is more--more nostalgia from those who accuse civil
society thinkers of hankering for the "good old days." It goes like
this. Much of l960s politics was about 'Thinking Big' in yet
another sense. It was about what were called 'movements.' The civil
rights movement, the anti-war movement, the student movement, the
women's movement. Politics was happening, it appeared, only when
tens of thousands of people took to the streets, sometimes in the
name of non-negotiable demands. But movement politics is inherently
unstable and ephemeral and geared toward publicity. The movement
politics that had the greatest staying power is that which is
institutionally tethered, as in the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference's mooring in black Baptist congregations. Many of those
lodging the Nostalgia Complaint are themselves hankering for a
return to big movement politics, it seems. It follows that civil
society looks too, well, small; too modest; even, perhaps, too
ameliorative.


But you don't have to be Max Weber with his famous definition of
politics as the patient boring of hard boards, to have arrived at
the recognition that building and sustaining decent institutions
is at the heart of the democratic matter. And movements don't do
that--don't build those ties of trust, reciprocity, accountability,
mutual self-help over time. No, but institutions, sturdy but
resilient institutions of democratic civil society do. These
institutions are, by definition, based on both giving and
receiving; on creating a structure of expectations and molding
reasonable and decent ways to meet these expectations.

What we have learned in the last half-century is that the horizon
of democracy recedes as democratic traditions and institutions
erode. What happens when that happens? For one thing, people not
only do not trust government, they do not trust one another:
precisely our current situation. For Tocqueville, this loss of
trust flows, in part, from a kind of terminal skepticism.
Listen to Tocqueville on this point: "If man had to prove for
himself all the truths of which he makes use every day, he would
never come to an end of it. He would wear himself out proving
preliminary points and make no progress...some beliefs must be
accepted without discussion so that it is possible to go deeply
into a few selected ones for examination. It is true that any man
accepting any opinion on trust from another puts his mind in
bondage. But it is a salutary bondage, which allows him to make
good use of freedom. So somewhere and somehow authority is always
bound to play a part in intellectual and moral life."

Human beings being the kinds of creatures we are, we put ourselves
into this state of "salutary bondage" when where is a prior basis
of trust, whether the affinity of kin or congregation or parish or
precinct, or where such trust can be presumed or taken on faith.
That is the hard truth civil society thinkers call us to. Civil
society creates spaces for the enactment of human projects,
yes, but it also reminds us that this is a world of ties that bind.
You cannot have all the good things of democratic life and culture
sans authoritative determinations, accountability, and duty
altogether. Isn't that what the 'nostalgia' rebuff is finally all
about? We want all sorts of things "solved" once and for all by
policy makers and experts and others who will do this job for us.
But civil society reminds us of what political philosopher, Hannah
Arendt, called the "elementary problems of human living-together."

In an era--our own--when there is widespread agreement that
 American democracy is in some trouble; when a mountain of data has
been offered up displaying our civic depletion and cynicism, we do
well not to yearn for the confident reassurance that government can
get things right if we but let it and give it leave to do its job.
Government can help or hinder. But it is finally a task for the
overlapping, plural associations of civic life in which citizens
build and pass on those formative institutions--families, schools,
churches, unions and all the rest, including state and local
governments--without which there is no democratic culture and,
indeed, nothing for the federal government to either correct or
curb or serve.

Subject: A Time to Think

        Dear Members of the Task Force,

        Since our June meeting I have given considerable thought to how we
could be good economists of our time and also come up with an imaginative
and useful final product.  I very much need your reaction to some of the
propositions and questions I've penned below. 
        I'd like to narrow our focus to community activities (by which we
seem to mean voluntary organizations or groups connected to a birthright) 
that contribute to the larger community of citizens - what we might call
the civic community. 
        I'd like us to gather information with a functional goal in mind. 
Bill Boltz suggested that we might think in terms of making a report that
could be a blueprint for a PBS type documentary on communities that could
strenghen the nation in the 21st century.  He also suggested that our
final report should be a site on the world wide web with both linkages to
the websites of the various groups we discuss and relevant audo and visual
clips.  This is someting that could be kept current and hence become a
resource for the groups that we have identified as playing a constructive
and exemplary role in American life.  A third possibility which would be
more of an adaptation of the first two would be the production of a CD-ROM
on the subject of contemporary communities. 
        Michael Piore reminds me that we are academics and we should
probably not stray too far from what academics do best, i.e., write up
research findings.  Since this is true, we are going to want to make the
right moves now in our investigative phase so we shall have something
worthwhile to report on.  Moreover, I do not think that it is putting the
cart before the horse to think about our final report now because the
report is our horse. We will have to be crafting its form and language in
fourteen months.  Its cogency, communicability and reach will define the
quality of our work. 
        If we decide to focus upon groups which contribution to the larger
civic community (AND IF I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, I SHALL
ASSUME THIS IS SETTLED), we could make a major contribution by helping
various communities get in touch with each [This is in response to Michael
Piore's emphasis upon how groups interact with each other, not simply how
open they might be to outsiders].  We could also concentrate on their
actual contributions to civic participation.  Acknowledging that there are
a plethora of communities abroad in the land, Tom Bender suggested that we
seek to find out which kinds of communities enrich civic life and which
seem to leach or weaken our civic life.  I would prefer to accent the
positive and look for those groups that manifestly enhance public life as
well as those that are open to cooperative efforts. 
	So what is our action plan? 
	Let's each of us pick one of the community categories we singled out at
our June meeting (the internet, new or unconventional communities,
communities sponsored by universities, and communities with civic goals). 
I, for instance, have decided to look at communities with civic goals
(political action, social improvement, or citizen services) for Southern
California.  Looking at our roster, I see that this approach would net us
coverage of Cambridge-Boston, New York, Chicago, New Jersey, Philadelphia,
Austin, Durham, Pittsburgh, Washington, Ithaca, Fairfax County, and
Princeton in addition to Los Angeles and any national groups that some of
you might select. 
	Our goal should be to find exemplars of what we would like to see
replicated elsewhere.  In investigating them, we should come up with some
standard questions.  I will contribute some here and ask you to email me
your ideas so we can develop a set of questions which will always be
asked:  How do you conceive of your group's place in and concern for the
nation?  What ways have you found to get active participation from
members?  Which groups in the community, state, nation do you interact
with?, How could an investigation such as ours help you achieve your
goals?  [PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO EDIT THESE, BUT ESPECIALLY ADD SOME
MORE]
	I think for our "show and tell" meeting in Los Angeles, in December of
1998 we will want to highlight a few effective groups, so we should be
thinking of candidates for inclusion in that program as we go along. 
	Here is a schedule for us:  
	September 20th - response from each of you to the questions and
suggestions posed here with an indication of which groups you intend to
investigate.  
	November 1st - rough report on your work to be circulated to task
force, preferably by email
	November 15th - final decisions on what we wish to do at our group
meeting in December in Washington.  At our last meeting we decided that we
wished to enlarge our task force.  The Penn Commission has agreed to pay
the expenses of three additional task force members.  I shall get out
letters next week inviting Robert Moses of the Cambridge Public School
(with Terry Williams of the New School as a back-up) and Marcia Choo,
Program Director of the Asian Pacific American Dispute Resolution Center,
to join us in Washington.  We had spoken of inviting Richard Rodriguez.  I
think it unlikely that he will join and request that we switch to Henry
Cisneros who is now in Los Angeles, working with the Hispanic Cable TV
Channel and the local chapter of the Industrial Areas Foundation with
which some of you may be familiar. 		
	At this writing the groups that I intend to investigate are the
Liberty Hill Foundation, the Industrial Areas Foundation and Communities
for a Better Environment (which is statewide). 
	I look forward with great anticipation to your responses. We do
have a splendid opportunity to be effective.  The prospect raises my
spirits.  
	Joyce

Dear Task Forcers --   I'm a little perplexed that no one has responded to
the message that I sent early last month.  Should I send it again?  I've
been interviewing the heads of various community-building groups in Los
Angeles and would like to share my thought with you, but first I'd like to
know if my email messages are getting through?  Happy Labor Day!  Joyce

Joyce--

One more thought:  Roger Waldinger in the sociology department at UCLA is
somebody you sould talk to.  He works on immigration and has contacts in
all of the different immigrant comunities, or at least, among people who
study them.  In addition, a group of colleagues in different departments
has been studying the Service worker Internation Union and their justice
for janmitors campaign in LA.
