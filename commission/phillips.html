JUDITH RODIN: 
To begin that process we pick up
approximately where we left off, with efforts to understand
the ways in which market forces and values and governmental policies
and institutions with which they interact create and sustain the
public culture which we have described.
<p>
To help us do that, we have with us this morning one of the most
astute observers of American political and
economic system.  Kevin Phillips is well known to many of you as the
editor and publisher of the American Political Report, as a columnist
for the LA Times and as the author of "The Politics of Rich and Poor:
The Emerging Republican Majority," and more recently "Arrogant
Capital:  Washington, Wall Street and the Frustration of American
Politics."
<p>
Mr.  Phillips notably was the first to describe Nixon's Southern
strategy and to forecast the emergence of the South as a dominant
conservative influence in American politics.  In his writings, he's
analyzed the current dysfunction of American politics, the rise of
public frustration and cynicism and the privileged role of special
interest and elites in our political system.  He's a graduate of
Colgate and the University of Edinburgh.  Mr.  Phillips also
earned a JD at Harvard before becoming active in US politics in the
mid-1960s.  We are very fortunate to have him with us this morning to
help us understand the market, the state and the dynamics of public
culture.  Kevin Phillips.
<p>
KEVIN PHILLIPS:  It's a pleasure to be here this morning.  I
can't help but think in coming to Philadelphia and looking around at
the buildings that create a memory of such distinguished leaders that
the crisis in American leadership really is somewhat uniquely nuanced.
Some of you will have read in the recent news magazines about the
extraordinary identification procedures that are being taken in
preparation for the president's potential confrontation with Paula
Jones.  The president couldn't have a press conference the other day
because he was afraid of questions about the military and, you know,
what's a problem for an aspirant for chairman of the Joint
Chiefs might just happen to be regarded by some as a problem for the
commander in chief?  No.
<p>
Then you've got the speaker of the House of Representatives, when he
was fined--reprimanded and fined, immediately sent a bunch of people
to look to see whether he could deduct his fine as a business
expense.  I mean, I think, frankly what we've got here is the
shamelessness twins.  And I say that throwing out that
market forces are not by any means the only things involved in
politics and the role of government.  Before turning to all the rest
of it, I think that some of what's happening here is the effect of
communications and upheavals and the different way in which
people are pulled into the spotlight.  In pulling into politics,
people whose hunger for the spotlight is in some respects matched only
by their inability to perform usefully in it.  And I won't belabor
this, but obviously there are a number of people whose names come
to mind.
<p>
So what I'll do at this point is turn to the subject matter
of what we're talking about.  But I put that out as an up-front caveat
that I'm not any kind of economic determinist and I don't think that
the economic forces rule supreme.  But having said that, let me
now turn to the question of governments and the marketplace
and the way in which they contribute and help to shape the politics
and the culture and the frustration, frankly.
<p>
Some of you will have certainly seen in Washington of
late a small but growing group of analyses and articles and columns on
how the United States and the West have entered a golden age.  And the
golden age involves the end of the Soviet Union, of the rise of market
forces and essentially technology as the lubricant of market
forces playing a more useful role almost than ever before.  Now I
don't think that the golden age is real.  Another point to
make very quickly is it's thought of mostly by people who want to put
a great and favorable cast on the events of the last 20 years.  The
difficulty is that nobody was talking about a golden age in 1993 or
'94 and probably not 1995.  It's something we saw come up in '96.
I don't think it'll last out in '97.  I think by '98 and '99 we'll be
back in this premillennial hubbub and hurly burly which I'll
come back to.  I think we're sort of in a version of the eye of
the hurricane here in that a lot of the problems that are central to
this whole discussion and the context of both society and politics and
economics will come hurtling back.
<p>
But if we're not in a golden age, then a lot of things that are
proclaimed as new because old circumstances have ended, then they
won't have ended.  And the likelihood of adjustments being fairly
ferocious after a long period of things sort of being juggled and
suspended may be pretty steep.  So I think there are reasons to
take quite seriously the likelihood that the next two or three years
will be a period that has a lot of upheaval in it and some that
we're not ready for, which will have an enormous bearing on what you
do.
<p>
Let me turn to the politics of too much government being the problem,
which was certainly the reality of 20 to 30 years
ago--and the politics up until the 1980s--in some cases, it still
lingers--and the new politics of a potential problem in catering to
the markets having gotten out of hand.  I was very much involved 30
years ago in the Republican strategizing to try to start a new
conservative era which, in fact, we did do at the national level--20
out of 24 years, from 1968 to '92.  It didn't start with a sense that
government in a broad way was too big and out of control.
Richard Nixon actually enlarged a number of aspects of government.
And the conservatives have complained, you know, ever since that
he was the last liberal or something like that as opposed to the first
conservative.  I think the part of government that was leaned on and
was corrected or worsened or whatever definition you want to take
there was the attempt on the part of the government in the 1960s to
move into sociological blueprinting and decision making--something that
really had not been done by the Democratic coalition before, was not a
logical extension of the New Deal and did not work, or at least
doesn't seem to have worked and is now pretty much rejected.
<p>
But it wasn't a broad repudiation of government.  That came with
Ronald Reagan.  And this is the point at which I think it's useful to
turn to the rhythm of politics in the sense of there are periods
in American history in which repudiation of government and adoration
of the marketplace gets out of hand.  And it is not a philosophic
thing.  It's a very self-interested thing.  But we saw another one
start in the 1980s.  And this was mentioned--I wrote a book
called "The Politics of Rich and Poor" which came out in 1990, and the
ironic thing was that the lead quote on the back of the book jacket
was from Richard Nixon, who agreed with the book's thesis.  And the
thesis of the book basically was that Republican periods
(unintelligible) in American politics in their later stages go berserk
in a `markets can do everything' direction and blow up speculative
bubbles.
<p>
And this happened in the Gilded Age and it happened in the
1920s.  Usually a Republican period, a generation, whatever, will
start out with a broader base and will have more middle class
nationalism and--this is obviously just a once over--but it takes
awhile to go into the market overdrive, but it always happens.  And
the fascinating parallels between the 1980s and the roaring '20s
and the Gilded Age were one of the basic subjects in "The
Politics of Rich and Poor." Now since this is a reasonably precise
context for some of what we're talking about in the sense of the
impact of the change in relations between government doing more
and markets less and then markets doing more and governments
less--this changeover has pretty much occurred three times, and
the '80s were in no sense the first. <p>

So the 10 parallels--and they're pretty good parallels.  I'll go
through them quickly.  Most of you can put more of the history in
place, but again, it's not hard to document.  The 10 parallels
between the '80s, the '20s and the Gilded Age were more or less as
follows.  First, you had conservatives in power, usually Republicans.
<p>
The second thing, you had anti-government psychologies developed; a
philosophic belief in less government, whether it would be
deregulation or tax cuts or ultimately privatization--all these
things.
<p>
The third parallel was that pro-business psychologies
developed--entrepreneurialism, support for the marketplace.  All of
this came hand in hand with the sense that government had done too
much and ought to do less.
<p>
The fourth parallel was that the '80s, like the '20s and the period
100 years earlier--the 1880s and 1890s--was bad for labor.  These are
always tough times for labor.  It's very logical.  If business is
in fashion, conservatives are in power, government is losing
support, labor is going to have a problem.
<p>
The fifth parallel was that these have all been eras of mergers, of
all kinds of restructuring of business and finance and banking, some
very, very elaborate, ranging from the trusts in the late 19th
century down to the public utility holding companies in the '20s and
all the games in the '80s and '90s.  But again, it's quite a
parallel.  This stuff all sort of happens together.
<p>
The sixth parallel is you get tax cuts or tax rate reductions, and
that becomes a goal and a politics of some power:  cut
taxes, cut taxes.
<p>
The seventh parallel--these are periods of disinflation.  They follow
periods not only of big government or bigger government but of
inflation.  So in these periods you get disinflation.
<p>
The eighth parallel is, as you get disinflation in the United States,
whether it was in the 1980s or 1920s or 100 years earlier in the
populist era--what you get is a geographically divided
economy.  The interior part of the country, which has the
commodities--agriculture, energy, mining, what have you--takes a big
hit.  The parts of the country that have the service economy and the
financial economy and the cutting-edge industry gained during these
periods.  So you had what was called by the Democrats in the
mid-1980s, quite correctly but they didn't know the historical
precedence for it, the bicoastal economy.  And it's quite right.
The mid section of the country was taking a hit while California,
Massachusetts, New York were in very high clover in the mid-1980s.
<p>
The ninth parallel is you get during these periods a massive increase
in the gap between the rich and the poor or the rich and everyone
else.  The share of the top 1 percent in terms of income jumps from,
oh, 8 percent and 9 percent to 14 percent, 15 percent, 16 percent.
The share of wealth increases even more.  The data's not good for 100
years ago or for the 1920s, so comparison isn't too easy, but the
parallel is vivid and just absolutely undeniable.
<p>
And the last of the parallels between these periods--they
were more than decades the economy is heavy with
leveraged debt and speculation.  New instruments of every variety,
records set on the speculative and debt side, and as I say, the
parallel between the 1980s and the 1920s and the gilded age, all
of those 10 are very easy to check out and they prove out.
<p>
Now obviously this has quite a bit of significance, but one of the
things that always happened before is the thesis put out by
Joseph Schumpeter on creative destruction of capitalism, that
capitalism would go too far in these ways that I just mentioned.  The
speculative bubble would pop and it would create a cultural, economic
and political reaction the other way, and things would change, and
then slowly but surely you'd get ready to go through some variety of
the same thing again later.
<p>
Well, this time no bubble popped.  You had some degree of change
under Bill Clinton, but not much for not long, and it wasn't
done well and--and he basically didn't pull it off.  So he had to call
in the famous (unintelligible) Dickie Morris for help on how to do
things.  So he wound up basically standing for not much of anything by
1995 and not representing the normal corrective force.  But you can't
blame him really, because the speculative bubble didn't pop.
<p>
Now this gets me to another set of interesting questions as part of
this false macho of the marketplace.  I was on a panel with Al
Dunlap formerly of Scott Paper--now whatever the hell it is that he's
ripping off.  I don't know.  And he got started on capitalism and
socialism.  `Now we've got to stop socialism.' And my point was, `What
kind of socialism?  How about Wall Street socialism?  Why don't we
stop some Wall Street socialism?' Because the most fascinating pattern
of the last 15 years in terms of how this speculative bubble kept
getting bigger and shinier and filmier without popping was that you
had this extraordinary socialization of risk and displacement of the
marketplace. <p>

Now for all that Al Dunlap may posture about being a sort of Marlboro
Man of the boardroom or something--in fact, the whole system
has been full of bailouts.  It started in the 1970s--Lockheed and
Chrysler; by the early 1980s, you had Texas and Chicago banks being
bailed out; you could see the S&L mess taking shape in the late '80s;
Alan Greenspan bailed out the stock market crash on a giant Hawaiian
wave of liquidity; 1988 and '89 and '90, the S&Ls get bailed out;
1990, we see the commercial banks get bailed out, and not just up to
the $100,000 insurance.  The hot money from everywhere in the world
was bailed out up to the full size of the deposit or the CD because to not
do so could have caused all kinds of problems.
<p>
Yeah, but what happened to the marketplace here?  No marketplace, no
corrective, no lessons learned.  Then we get down to the peso
problem, and after NAFTA, it was so attractive to park your money
in bonds down in Mexico.  A lot of people did it.  Great
returns.  All of a sudden the peso heads south, but let's not
have the marketplace here, fellows.  Time for a bailout.  Time for
government to come in, socialize the risk.  If you're a little guy
that owns a drugstore, you don't get socialized risk.  If you're the
financial sector, socialized risk is the rule.
<p>
So what we have had is this steady buildup of debt finance and
speculative bubbles and a kind of stock market and financial markets
vigilantism riding herd on every public policy move so that it
doesn't do something to disrupt it.  Now what I'm suggesting is that,
A, this has delayed the corrective that has come in the system before,
which is part of the problem; but, B, it's helped promote this--don't
know whether you'd call it individualist myth or reality or whatever.
Instead of having the cowboy fight it out and lose the gun battle
and get buried, here he was taken care of by Alan Greenspan, by Bob
Rubin, by everybody who moves and the bullets are blanks.
He doesn't go down.  So as he doesn't go down, he gets this myth of
American capitalism and the tough guys and the entrepreneurs and the
strength of all this rugged individualism.  But it's ersatz.
It hasn't really done that well as individualism.
It's done very well as financial market socialism.
<p>
But this is the debate that doesn't happen.  This debate never gets
looked at.  You would think that all the number of people involved in
progressive politics could stand up and say, `What do you mean you
people are individualists?  You're not individualists.  Every time
something goes wrong you've been bailed out.' Well, the whole
structure of politics and culture today is artificially based
around something that really isn't doing that well.  And
yet you have all kinds of ennoblement of markets and entrepreneurs and
tough guys and business and so forth, and CEOs' salaries can go to
incredible levels and everything you know full well.  So what I'm
suggesting here is that there are some very funny behavior patterns
and that this is a period during which you have had an abnormally
drawn out ability of this mood and approach to survive.
<p>
Now the question, I guess, then becomes, you know, how long?  Now
let me turn back to politics and to government, because
government--obviously in this Wall Street socialism and bailing-out
process, government is playing a role.  People may not
want to say, `Hey, we love the government,' but, boy, they sure as
hell love the city in which the government is based because they all
want to go there and be lobbyists.  And they must want to go there and
be lobbyists because there's a role for government.  And that role for
government is passing stuff to help their clients or whatever they
represent.
<p>
So I wrote a book in 1993 that came out in 1994 called
"Arrogant Capital," and basically what "Arrogant Capital" did was to
look at  the old historical pattern of great powers as
they start to go downhill--very, very strong pattern of the capital
cities being overloaded with every type of interest group you can
imagine.  In the case of Rome had lawyers, but others were more
ecumenical.  Madrid, as it started to go downhill, was just full of
clergy for whom they couldn't find jobs.  They even had in Madrid in
the early 17th century the first version of a think tank.  It was
places--hostels, almost, that universities ran where people who had
gone to that university and couldn't get jobs could hang their hat for
a while.  I regard these as the first think tanks because it--same
level of--of social achievement, frankly.  That probably offends a few
people here, but I'm prepared to take it a couple of notches further.
<p>
What  we see in Washington isn't unique at this point.  There
are a lot of capital cities in the G-7 countries that are heartily
despised by the people.  Ottawa, for example, is disliked about as
much as Washington.  Rome, they tried to divide the country so
they could get out from under Rome.  Paris is loathed.  The Scots and
the Welsh don't want to be governed by London.  The Japanese are
trying to--some want to move their capital.  Germans are
obviously leaving Bonn to go to Berlin.  Capital cities take on this
animosity and it's a very real thing beyond ours.
<p>
But ours is unique.  Now it's only unique in scale.  If you go to the
states, you can see the same thing.  I never forget my first view of
Sacramento, California, coming down from the hills.  And I'd just been
looking at some old gold mining artifacts in California.  Ah, it
wasn't very impressive.  Seen one old mine you've seen them all.  And
then coming down the hill, there it was, the new gold mine, the
Sacramento skyline.  They don't do anything there basically but move
money around with public policy justifications.  And it has a huge
number of people involved, and Washington still beats it absolutely
hands down--absolutely hands down.
<p>
Let me give you some statistics.  There was a survey done in early
1990s by a fellow from American University that there were 91,000
people involved in lobbying or supporting lobbying activities.  Then
it turns out--we tried to figure out how many lawyers there were in
Washington, not a statistic that anybody really wants to keep and
publish.  It's nothing you brag about.  We have more lawyers than
anybody else, you know?  But with a little work, you could start
pulling all this together.  And the way we finally did it was to get
the number of people admitted to the bar of the Federal
District Court of the District of Columbia.  Well, at the
point--whenever this was--in 1993, there were about 63,000 or so.  We
said, `Hey, how many back in 1950?' Well, they didn't have the
numbers.  So a woman there told my assistant, `Well, that's all right.
I'll add them up for you.' I'm--`You're going to add them up?' Wow, it
turns out there are under a thousand.  So it's been a hell of a growth
industry.
<p>
But Washington, DC, has probably anywhere from 40 percent to 50
percent of the tax bar, the telecommunications bar, the trade bar,
the patent and copyrights bar and I could go on with lesser
sub--trade, if I didn't put it in.  Just gang busters.  The
number of people who are lawyers or actual lobbyists in Washington is
probably close to 100,000.  If you ever want to make a tour
of American frustration, you come from Philadelphia where you see
the proud part of American history, the people who made a difference.
Go down to K Street in Washington and walk for a half a mile along K
Street.  Go in and look at the cards, the lists of people
who are in the building.  Every law firm you can imagine, every trade
association--you know, National Association of Indoor Bicycle
Operators, National Association of Coin Operated Laundromats, National
Association of No Longer Needed Employees, National Association of SEC
Violators.  You know, they're all there--absolutely all there.
Massive numbers.
<p>
Then the congressional staff:  22,000.  Next largest staff of a major
country's legislature is about 1/10th that size.  But this includes a
whole hoard of people who are lobbyists in training.  Think tanks have
somewhere between 6,000 and 7,000--15,000 journalists.  You know,
that's another major contribution to the workings of society--I mean,
15,000 journalists in Washington.  Then the international interests
there.  There's a book called "The Washington Representatives
Directory" and they have a section in the back on foreign interests
represented in Washington.  Back in 1979, there were about 400 listed,
now there are about 2,000.  There is virtually no major PR firm,
consultant firm, law firm or accounting firm that does not have
massive representation of foreign interests.  What isn't represented
very well is the interests of some poor little factory in southern
Illinois that might have to close down because they're going to
be outgunned from the time they get to town.
<p>
But you wonder why people despise the city.  They have a lot of
reasons to despise the city.  It's a city that has entrenched itself.
You really can't reach it now.  When a politician comes to Washington,
he may, out in Chillicothe, attack Washington.  When he gets to
Washington, it's like iron filings heading for the electromagnet.  You
saw that with Clinton, you saw it with Gingrich and the Republicans
and the Contract.  So essentially what people see is stuff gets
promised to them.  These people go to Washington and they become part
of the system. <p>

For the first time in the Congress prior to the Republican
one, you had two congressmen actually resigned--they didn't
wait--when major lobbying positions opened up.  I mean, why stay in
the second echelon position when there's a first-rate position
opening up where you can actually hand out the money instead of
queuing up for it?  And if that's seen as an over cynical
representation, probably it is but not so far that it's not worth
taking seriously.  That's sort of what the city's become.
<p>
Now beyond that, let me give you a notion of another reason why the
public is right to be very, very skeptical of all of this.  I've
suggested and I think it's plausible that the vital center has
been replaced by what we can call the venal center.  Now the venal
center at first, you could say, just represents the whole crowd I've
mentioned in profile.  Well, that's largely right.  But what I'm
suggesting here is that the people who are involved in things like
disarmament issues or prayer issues or things that are not
economic--they may have lobbies that have large memberships, but they
don't have the heavy hitters.  The heavy hitters in Washington, the
people with a lot of connection that can make amendments happen and
tax provisions disappear and all these good things, they're part of
what you call a venal center because they're essentially centrists.
They're not big screaming conservatives or big screaming liberals.
They're big screaming influence peddlers.  And that's basically what
they do.
<p>
And the upshot is that we have a system at this point that in
Washington it doesn't matter what legislation is up.  They put
legislation to extend a Millionaires Foundation provision
on the minimum wage bill.  The Dakota relief package has stuff for
Treasury contacts and the paper industry and business relations with
the Ukraine--I forget exactly what they were--reconciliation bills.
The budget process now has become another incredible gold mine.
<p>
There's one thing Washington can do brilliantly.  It's find enormous
profit opportunities in anything that exists governmentally or
legislatively.  So again, the reasons for the public to be enormously
doubtful about any of these things, it just screams out.  They
have ways of doing what they want to do and they'll bury it in
something and there it is.  But there's never anything buried
anonymously in legislation that's for the average person out in
Paducah, that's for sure.
<p>
So let me now try to look at what's going to change all of this.  And
you can be a little bit wondrous what really is going to change
all of this.  Now the difficulty is that our system as before had
correctives of a sort.  The marketplace has had a corrective, politics
has had a corrective, anti-Washington politics has been a
corrective--all of these things would change the political eras.  But
what's going to change them now?
<p>
Now Washington at this point seems largely unaffected by what's
happening in the other G-7 countries, but I don't know how closely you
follow the overseas elections, but conservatives are taking a terrific
bath.  And Newt Gingrich can talk about how Tony Blair is a
Thatcherite all he wants.  I find that preposterous, but
it doesn't even really matter.  The conservatives just got their
lowest vote in Britain since 1832.  They've got the lowest number of
MPs since 1906.  The Conservative Party in Canada tanked from a
government with 155 MPs to being in fifth place in both the 1993 and
1997 elections.  The government in Italy is now olive trees center
left.  The government in France, we're not sure how socialist it's
going to be, but it's center left on paper.  In Japan, you now
have a coalition of sorts with the Liberal Democrats being not quite
what they were.  In the United States, you have at least on paper a
Democratic president in there committed to ideas different than the
Republicans.  In some ways, he clearly is.
<p>
So the whole G-7 conservative hegemony, which was vivid in the
1980s has collapsed.  Is it going to change here?
Is something going to make Clinton forthright on behalf of any
issues or ideas package?  I don't know.  He started out very poorly.
I think a lot of what went wrong for the Democrats in 1993-94 is his
fault.  Now he got bailed out by the fact that Gingrich created
another Democratic opportunity, but then the Democrats have sort of
handed that over, too. <p>

Now let me conclude by looking at what I think is the linchpin of
reform of the politics and political economics that I have described.
It is very simple the magic of the marketplace--the marketplace that
finally cracks the pseudomarketplace.  Now what I mean by this is that
in American history very, very vividly the bulk of the reform eras
have come from a major economic debacle.  And if you go through and
you look over the last 100 years at the major declines in the stock
market, the big ones, you'll find that they were big enough that they
took many, many years for the market to get back, but they also
produced reform eras and--except the ones during wars--and more often
than not, they produced a change in the party holding the White House
in the next presidential election.
<p>
Just let me give you an example of the magnitude of shift that we're
talking about.  In 1890, the bear market that followed
was 64 percent decline.  It took 15 years to get back to the 1890
level; 1906, the bear market was 48 percent, 10 years to get back;
1916, 56 percent, nine years to get back; 1929, 89 percent, 26 years
to get back; 1966, 38 percent, seven years to get back; 1973, 45
percent, 10 years to get back.
<p>
Now we have got built up in the present system an extraordinary
increase in the Dow Jones and the other averages with an enormous
participation by people whose savings and everything is going to be at
great risk if there is anything resembling the declines that I've just
mentioned.  The reaction this time, I think, would be more profound on
the part of the average person and their involvement and their
anger than ever before.  And you have to have
this golden age, this new era, this end of the business cycle, this
something or other to avoid having a bear market.  Maybe it won't be
38 or 40, but so far they've managed for about seven years, since
1990, not to have a technical bear market.  That's just mind-boggling.
<p>
So you have to wonder when something finally comes here after all this
delaying and gamesmanship, could it be something bigger than we
expect, and could it relate to the magnitude of what I've just
suggested?  If it has developed that magnitude, then I
think what you will see will be a political, economic and reformist
upheaval in the United States which will start to change a lot of the
psychologies involved here.  If there is not such a corrective in the
markets and political economy, well, you don't need to listen to me or
any other expert because your guess will be as good as anybody else's.
It would be an entirely new era in that ball game.
<p>
Let me stop here, and I'll be glad to come back to any parts of this
or pick up on any further angles.  Thank you. <p>
