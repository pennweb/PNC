The concept of community is at once descriptive and normative.  One
might
say that Euro-Americans have been in flight from community from the moment
of settlement, but they have as consistently longed for it.  The quest is
not only a recurring theme in American writing; generations of seekers
after community in America have founded their own utopias, from the
seventeenth-century Puritans, to nineteenth-century Fourierists, to
twentieth-century "hippies."
<p>
The invocation of community is almost always nostalgic;  community is
posed as a richer and more humane alternative to liberal individualism.
For left critics of Liberalism, community has a Rousseauian cast,
egalitarian and conducive to free consensus, while champions of
Conservatism (of the romantic sort, not market-oriented individualists)
imagine a hierarchical social body knit together by memory in a fixed
place.
<p>
Despite numerous attempts in the literature of philosophy and the social
sciences to give a bounded meaning to the idea of community and to the
experience of community, no common usage has developed.  Community remains
a term of enormous emotional appeal and remarkable vagueness.  It is
sometimes used very loosely to designate a unified society, something
perhaps better understood as a political community or commonweal.  Robert
MacIver developed this meaning in <i>Community: a Sociological Study </i>
(1917).  He referred to community as a unity of interests, something
instrumental, created by an act of political will rather than by
tradition.  Not far from MacIver is a liberal pluralist definition of
community that refers to a society made up of many partial communities
(such as the academic community).  Depending on one's sense of the
relations among these various organized interests, one has either liberal
fragmentation or the negotiated community of interests envisioned by
MacIver, one out of many (<i>e pluribus unum</i>).
<p>
More commonly, community is defined in terms of location. In this view, a
quarter of a city or a whole town or village might be referred to as a
community. For many Americans, the New England town of fond memory
represents community. Others would not necessarily deny that community
might be realized spatially, in a place, but they would emphasize a
quality of relationship as the special attribute of community. At times,
place coincides with this emotional bonding. But community without
propinquity is possible (as in scattered networks of friends), and in
modern cities one often finds physical proximity without community.
<p>
A community is most rigorously defined as a network of social relations
marked by mutuality and emotional bonds. It involves a limited number of
people in a somewhat restricted social space or network, held together by
shared understandings and a sense of obligation. There is a distinct
"we-ness" in such a community. Perhaps because the concept is so entangled
in nostalgia, there is a tendency to assume that within a community
conflict is absent and power is not structured or exercised. But communal
conflict and power are real, though differing from, say, market
competition in being mediated by emotional bonds. Finally, a community in
this sense is an end in itself, not a means to some other end.
Distinctively communal actions are based upon affection, not rational
calculation of self-interest.
<p>
All formal reflections on community assume a history, a process of change
leading to a moment when community became threatened or transformed into
something else. The social sciences were born of the attempt to gain
intellectual and social control over the modernizing transformations
associated with the democratic revolutions and the industrial capitalism
of the nineteenth century. Community, thus threatened with destruction,
became a focus of social analysis; it became one of the unit-ideas, to use
Robert Nisbet's phrase in <i>The Sociological Tradition </i> (1966), of
modern social theory.
<p>
The most widely influential sociological formulation of the nature of the
great transformation derives from the work of the German sociologist
Ferdinand T&ouml;nnies, whose <i>Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft </i>was
published in 1887. <i>Gemeinschaft</i>, usually translated as community,
is
characterized, he wrote, by "intimate, private, and exclusive living
together." <i>Gesellschaft</i>, usually translated as "association" or
"society," is identified with the city. It is an "artificial construction
of an aggregate of human beings," characterized by instrumental values,
competition, and impersonality. Summing up the difference between the two,
T&ouml;nnies observed that in <i>Gemeinschaft</i> people "remain
essentially united in spite of all separating factors, whereas in
<i>Gesellschaft </i>they are essentially separated in spite of all uniting
factors" (p. 65). These distinctions were incorporated into American
social science early in the twentieth century; later, after World War II,
they undergirded modernization theory, a unified theory of society and
social change associated with Talcott Parsons in sociology but elaborated
in all the social science disciplines.
<p>
The <i>Gemeinschaft-Gesellschaft </i>transformation was particularly
central to the development of urban theory at the University of Chicago,
the preeminent center for social science research in the interwar years.
W. I. Thomas in social psychology, Louis Wirth in urban studies, and
Robert Redfield in anthropology all worked with dichotomies derived from
T&ouml;nnies's distinction. This notion of community and social change
also found its way into historical scholarship, most clearly and
influentially in the work of Oscar Handlin, especially in <i>Boston's
Immigrants </i> (1941) and <i>The Uprooted </i> (1951).
<p>
These scenarios of community collapse, so common in modern American social
thought, derive from T&ouml;nnies, but they do not (save for the later
work of Redfield) accurately represent the argument T&ouml;nnies actually
made. He did not argue a community-breakdown thesis; rather he argued that
society became bifurcated. People in modern times were compelled to live
their lives in two modes and contexts: <i>Gemeinschaft </i>and
<i>Gesellschaft. </i> Community and society were not places, nor were they
historical sequences. They were distinct forms of human interaction that
constitute distinct but interlinked social forms in modern society.
T&ouml;nnies indicated that <i>Gesellschaft </i>was gaining significance
in people's lives, but he did not believe that all communal relationships
would disappear. Life, once more or less fully contained in local
communities, was in modern times inevitably and rather directly integrated
into larger structures of society. But, he concluded, "the force of
<i>Gemeinschaft </i>persists, even within the period of <i>Gesellschaft"
</i> (p. 232).
<p>
Instead of assuming the demise of community, the issue for scholarship --
and for life -- is to know where to look for community. One must be
prepared to recognize its various forms and locales. Most important of
all, one must acknowledge that one cannot live a modern life entirely
within the confines of community. And that need not be an occasion for
regret.
<p>
Unease with American competitive individualism and despair over group
conflict nourishes the dream of a community that is whole, providing a
complete and sustaining surround. Such a desperate need for community can
blind one to the way in which the impulse to community invites a quest for
sameness, thus representing an exclusive idea in a democracy ideally
inclusive. The desire to make the spirit of community universal risks
parochialism and threatens the cosmopolitan spirit necessary in a modern
heterogeneous society.
<p>
Some recent proponents of community, most notably Christopher Lasch in his
<i>The True and Only Heaven </i> (1991), recognize the parochialism of
their rejection of Enlightenment universalism and cosmopolitanism, but
insist that is a price they will pay. More worrisome are calls to renew a
presumed common culture uniting all Americans. <i>Habits of the Heart
</i> (1985), a best-selling book by Robert Bellah and several colleagues,
is a compelling diagnosis of contemporary America:  the authors argue that
Americans lack a language for expressing mutual respect and concern. But
when the authors call for revitalizing biblical and republican languages
from the American past, they imply that "community" must in principle mean
"commonality." That implication works against the best insights of the
book, which documents a diversified pursuit of public goods by various
groups of citizens. In <i>The Good Society </i> (1991), Bellah and
colleagues respond in part to this worry, recognizing that a society-wide
communal solidarity cannot be achieved in a pluralistic society. A recent
neo-Progressive movement calling itself communitarian, seeking to
recapture the broader spirit of community articulated by MacIver, has
emphasized social responsibility as part of the liberal tradition. In a
book titled <i>The Spirit of Community </i> (1993), Amitai Etzioni
balances rights with responsibilities, seeking to establish a new and
shared moral order without moralizing.
<p>
Other arguments for American pluralism, past and present, envision a
landscape of many communities, each distinct and exclusive, the whole
making up a diverse modern society. To some extent, this is precisely how
intense feelings of community were achieved in seventeenth-century New
England, but it can work only if these islands are isolated from one
another. If they are not, and T&ouml;nnies insisted that in modern times
such communities cannot pretend to be self-contained, then one must have a
social category greater than community, and it must be defined by its
accommodation of difference, by its cosmopolitanism. <p>

The dominant myths of American life, the New England town tradition and
the Jeffersonian ideal of agrarian democracy, tend to favor communalism
and avoid the complexity of cosmopolitanism. Both of these traditions are
identified with distinct regions. Both emphasize sameness; neither can
accommodate difference. The lay sermon delivered by John Winthrop aboard
the <i>Arbella </i>in 1630, upon the arrival of the Puritans in
Massachusetts Bay, is the most powerful statement of community in American
literature. Yet it is also a demand for sameness under God. "We must,"
Winthrop urged his party, "be knitt together in this worke as one man" (in
Bender, p. 63). He envisioned a single moral community that acknowledged
no distinction between private and public values.
<p>
Jeffersonian Democracy is far from Winthrop's religious utopia. Yet
beneath the confident democratic professions of Thomas Jefferson lay the
assumption of an underlying harmony of society and values. He feared
immigration and cities for the diversity of values that attended both, and
his inability to imagine a postslavery biracial American society reflected
his belief that no natural harmony of interests united -- or could unite
-- the former masters and former slaves. He feared, as he wrote in his
<i>Notes on the State of Virginia </i> (1784), that emancipation would
culminate in "the extermination of one or the other race" (p. 138).
<p>
There is, however, another historical tradition, identified with another
region, the middle colonies. Here, in contrast to the experience of
Massachusetts Bay and the Chesapeake, diversity marked society. Various
groups, especially in New York City, regularly interacted with each other
across lines of difference, and they created a political culture that not
only acknowledged diversity of interests and values but affirmed these
differences as a basis for liberty. The lessons of experience in the
middle colonies were articulated by the middle of the eighteenth century.
William Livingston, writing in <i>The Independent Reflector </i> (1753)
with reference to the founding of a college in New York, argued that since
the colony was divided by different religious and cultural traditions, the
college ought not be identified with any one community. He argued that the
institution must be equally accessible to and equally the possession of
the various groups of the larger society by means of control by the
colonial legislature. He grasped the relation of homogeneous communities
to a heterogeneous public. "For as we are split into so great a Variety of
Opinions and Professions; had each Individual his Share in the Government
of the Academy, the Jealousy of all Parties combating each other, would
inevitably produce a perfect Freedom for each particular Party" (p. 195).
<p>
The conditions of modernity compromise community and bring it into
relation with a heterogeneous public culture. Part of modern experience is
lived in small, <i>gemeinschaftlich</i> worlds of sameness, but they
cannot be all-inclusive or global. They inevitably must relate themselves
to a larger public world, where neither intimacy nor sameness is a bond.
The collective meaning of the public culture is not preordained; it is
constantly made and remade from a discourse of difference, even while a
belief in sameness sustains a particularistic sense of "we-ness," a sense
of intimacy real but necessarily with permeable boundaries in modern
society. The appeal of sameness can be acknowledged, and its appeal ought
not be begrudged anyone. Yet it must be limited in its reach. Small
circles of "we" characterized by sameness and even parochialism nourish
and secure part of everyone's identities, but everyone is also engaged in
a broader and more public sense of the "we." The problem of community in
modern society is to understand the interplay, personally and politically,
of the smaller homogeneous circles of "we" and the more inclusive and
cosmopolitan world of public culture.
