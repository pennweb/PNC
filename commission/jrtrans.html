<p>
JUDITH RODIN:  OK.  May I ask you to be seated so that we can get started?
I hope now that we've warmed you up we can cool you off again.  Not
literally, because we are turning to the first of the three sessions that
we've been calling the hot button issues--the issues that bring out the
worst and--sometimes, we hope, the best in our public culture and in our
political processes.
<p>
Each of these issues is chosen not only as an issue worthy of
conversation--though each certainly is.  We're trying to use each one as
an exemplar of the three areas
that we defined at our first meeting--those areas which are not only of
primary interest to us, but are areas where we think our deliberation
really could make a significant difference.  Those three areas are the
culture of intolerance, the failure of leadership and the fragmentation of
communities.
<p>
Each of these large topics can be used, then--and we have really
challenged our speakers to try to do that, and I challenge us in our
comments and conversation afterwards to try to do that--to remember that
it isn't only the substance, but also the way that this substantive area
is being used that helps us to understand these
three important domains.
<p>
Tomorrow, following the third of the presentations on a hot-button
issue, we'll break into working groups.  You'll recall that there was
much conversation in December about how we could move the agenda of
the commission forward in the period between the meetings and
particularly given that people are busy and that we really do want to
do things that are consequential and potentially unique.  And so
the working groups provide a chance to have smaller groups of
conversations. The working groups are an effort to accomplish that, and we
will have the first of those working group sessions tomorrow afternoon.
The working groups will get a
chance to define themselves and redefine themselves and their mission,
ranging from collecting empirical data to commissioning papers to
making videotapes for the media to whatever.  And we'll provide
the necessary resources for the working group.  But we reframed the
titles of the working groups to be more affirmative, rather than
negative.
<p>
And so, in the culture of intolerance group, we will be reframing
that to think more broadly about culture and behavior.  We will consider
the ways in which patterns of poor behavior--whether uncivil or
intolerant--or good
behavior and positive behaviors really influence, in a transformative way,
events in society that matter.
<p>
We saw in December that many problem areas arise when we talk about
the impact of incivility.  We hope that the Culture and Behavior
working group may also begin to explore the ideas and the attitudes
through which more positive behaviors can be engendered--and
there are smiles among the psychologists--but to try to really
relate from the most anthropological and sociological levels, down to
the individual psychological level.  I feel strongly that we can't
stop at the level of the system, and it really is at the intersect of
society and individual behavior where a lot of the action is, and
we need to think about.
<p>
Our next session will focus on the failure of leadership, and we're
going to have the opportunity to explore, later this afternoon, why
our leaders seem so trapped by their constituencies and many seem
incapable of even undertaking the most important and obvious public
tasks.  Campaign finance reform seems a very good example of that
and we began, on the margin, a discussion of that--at least a
little bit of a conversation about that this morning.  But, again, it
is being used as a model, a vehicle for us to have a conversation about
the dynamics of leadership and the failure of leadership in the 1990s.
<p>
Tomorrow the working group on Leadership in a Democratic Society can
reframe the questions, but certainly we hope that you will explore
both the obstacles and the opportunities for leadership, not only in
politics, but certainly throughout the professions and the
broader society.  And finally, tomorrow morning, we'll have the third of
our
hot-button issues, the fragmentation of communities.  Again,
immigration policy seems a very good example of a way to allow
us to understand why communities can come to blows surrounding these
issues, and whether traditional or multicultural views really
prevail.  This gives us a chance to see the role of respective groups
and individuals as they relate to American life and important
questions.
<p>
I think that the working group model will be very, very successful.
This is a wonderful venue and all of us benefit enormously--I know I
certainly do--from hearing one another's questions, and my own
thinking is enriched by each question.  So we will, of course,
continue the plenary sessions on a biannual basis, but the working
groups really have a chance to do something that's quite different and
hopefully quite impactful, and I'm looking forward to those
efforts as well.
<p>
I will, then, ask Paul Begala to introduce our speaker and begin the
first session.
