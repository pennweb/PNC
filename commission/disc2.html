JUDITH RODIN:  Well, we have a variety of perspectives from which
we can take this.  Why don't we begin, though, in focusing on
one of Tom's assertions that it is really a thinning of discourse
that we are seeing, that the nature of politics is changing
to some extent.  The nature of our society is changing to some extent.
But
that as we see this thinning of discourse, we're also seeing a change--and
now
I am reading into your words, Tom, and adding my own--that we're seeing a
change in the role that mediating institutions play.  That you could have
thinning of discourse, if there were these middle-level institutions,
whether
they're in Lani's instance, the classroom, which has often served that
function, or institutions such as schools, universities, but other
mediating
institutions--the church, the family--where the discourse stayed thicker
or
richer.  And somehow since we've lost or the hypothesis might be that
since we've lost those as well, we really are in a social situation in
which
we're feeling the consequences more profoundly of the thinning of the
discourse.
<p>
JAMES FISHKIN:  Tom ended with a quote, something to the effect that the
cure for the ills of democracy might be more democracy.  What sprang to my
mind was the fact that in the McGovern-Fraser Commission, which reformed
the
primaries, they used the same quote.  And you remember in 1968, Humphrey
got
the Democratic nomination without entering a single primary.  So then
there
was the reform.  And they said the cure for the ills of democracy was more
democracy and they created conditions for proliferating
primaries for both.  And on a statewide basis, the number of primaries
went
from 17 to 39. <p>

And the result was more democracy but thinner democracy, exactly the
opposite
of what you're advocating.  And that's not a criticism of what you were
saying, quite to the contrary.  The question is:  The cure for the ills
of democracy may be more democracy, but you have to ask which kind of
democracy.  And part of the problem is that the public, and our political
culture increasingly identifies democracy just with anything more direct
and
more majoritarian and participatory, but thin participatory--just people
voting.  And democracy really involves the kind of discussion that Lani
was describing.  And we need to think about creating not democratic reform
that is just more voting, but particularly in a televised sound bite
context--but more discussion and more public space where people can engage
in
the kind of discussion she [outlined] but that has no purchase on the
public--or
little purchase on the public imagination.  Because when they think about
democracy, they think about just public opinion polls and primaries and
referendums and taking things directly to the people without
the social context can backfire and make everything ever thinner, as you
were
saying.
<p>
 BENDER:  Can  I just say I really agree with him.  That's really the
argument I was making.  Although, I would suggest that not to be
too naive, which I am prone to sometimes to fall into, but I think that
there's a lot of evidence in the proliferation of all kinds of small
community
groups.  I mean, in my own city of New York there's something like 17,000
community neighborhood groups, these sorts of things.  They don't have
anything to do, so we don't think about that.  But the point of being in
power, which I think Lani and I both made
this point, I think, changes that and people may come to understand it
differently.
<p>
FISHKIN:  Mm.  But I think we should have had Putnam here in the debate
about Putnam's work in order to get at all these other kinds of civic
asso[ciations]--that sort of richness of associational life a la
Tocqueville would be
one of the questions that we would [address].  It's one of several
questions that
should be on the agenda, I think, of this commission.
<p>
RODIN:  I agree.
<p>
MICHAEL SCHUDSON:  I want to take issue with one point that Tom
made, though.  I think I agree with a lot of what he said including
his conclusions, but I think expertise got a bad rap that it doesn't
deserve.  And my reading of Dewey is that he conceded about 98 percent
of what Lippmann had to say and that he did so correctly.  And that
expertise
is, in fact, that form of authority which is the most democratic.  And
unless we're going to some solution in which we're going to eliminate
authority, it seems we have to find some appropriate democratic model in
which to incorporate and honor expertise.
<p>
Maybe Lippmann didn't have that.  Dewey's response was to say that, `Well,
experts, and this [in] ThePublic and Its Problems, experts should
be sort of advisory and deal with the technical aspects and then
return that to the public to make the sort of substantive decisions.'
But, I mean, Dewey certainly knew that dualisms of that sort--oh, just the
technical details of the experts won't work and that if you're giving them
just the technical details, they have a lot of authority.  And I think
they
deserve a lot of authority.  And how you incorporate that into a
democratic
theory is--I don't have a solution to. <p>

But it seems to me that the expert finding an honest way
to put expertise back into the solution rather than putting it to the side
is really crucial.  One last quick comment, I don't know the solution
to Lowell High School either, but I know here that, in a way, your class
was a group of experts; that is, they weren't stakeholders in a situation
and
that gave them a certain freedom that, you know, the parents
of the kids there didn't have it.  So they had an easier task.
<p>
BENDER:  Can I respond?  Yes, I think what you just said on
the second point is part of the answer to the expert.  Just
that--at least my reading of Dewey is not to have them be technical
advisers,
actually, but actually force the experts not to use authority but to give
reasons to actually take part.  They have special resources they bring to
it,
and they're in a somewhat independent position, although he thought it
was a myth that the expert could truly be independent.  But nonetheless
they
could be not unlike these students who don't have a stake but can be a
part of
the conversation as opposed to having an authoritative answer, which is
another way of stopping the conversation and making the public passive.
<p>
SCHUDSON:  But I thought again, that's what an expert is, is someone who
has 
to give reasons and has a framework in which to do that.
<p>
GUINIER:  I think that the conversation could have taken place with the
parents at Lowell High School and with the students at Lowell High School.
In
fact, I got a number of e-mails from students at Lowell High School who
had
heard about what was happening [in]my class and wanted to know what we
were doing
because they were having similar conversations.  And, indeed, when the
students and some of the community people got together, they came up with
a
lottery as a solution.  It was not ultimately adopted by the
superintendent of schools, but it was a resolution that many of the people
who
are most invested in the school also came up with.  That's one point.
<p>
But I think my students may not have been immediate stakeholders, but they
were, quote, "representative" stakeholders because when you're talking
about
issues of race, people feel very invested.  That's part of the problem.
They
take positions based on their group or other identity and feel very much
that
the decision is going to affect them, even if it doesn't affect them
individually or personally.  So they may have had a certain amount of
expertise, but I would probably suggest that their expertise was
actually an expertise in problem solving as opposed to an expertise from
simply being detached or distant.
<p>
And in that sense, I see the positive of legal training.  That is, I think
that lawyers do have enormous capacity to become public and private
problem
solvers.  If we can get away from this adversarial model in which the
outcome
is all that is noticed and the outcome is measured like a game in a sense
of scoring.
<p>
RODIN:  Funny, I was always struck, in fact, that the judiciary at least
is one place 
when we have legal decision-making, where reasoned discourse and reasoned
giving 
is absolutely crucial and remains one of places where we admire
sophisticated conversation and very rich and elaborated discussion.  How
is that reconciled with this criticism of the legal profession as somehow
moving us in a very different direction?
<p>
GUINIER:  Well, actually there are a number of interesting
books, and I'm thinking immediately of one by Gerald Rosenberg, The Hollow
Hope, in which he makes the argument that part of the problem with using
litigation or using the judicial system to resolve important public
dilemmas
is that it takes the issue out of the public debate and consigns it to a
group
of so-called experts who talk mainly among themselves in a language that
only
they or some other equally educated and knowledgeable people can
understand.
And as a result, the decision may have immediate legitimacy, but not
long-term
legitimacy.  That is, what would be more helpful to, quote, "civil
society" is
to have a public debate in which more people participated and which more
people felt empowered to participate.
<p>
The outcome may, in fact, be exactly the same, but the process would be
very
different.  And as a result, if more people are participating, even if
they
disagree with the outcome, they are more likely to respect it because they
feel that their views have been taken into account simply because
they've been heard.
<p>
RODIN:  Mmm.  OK.  Yeah.
<p>
NEIL SMELSER:  I'd like to press you just a little harder on that.  Your
seminar or class was not forced to decide anything.  In fact, that's the
nature of a seminar and a lot of our discourse and a lot of our
education, whereas the other settings in which you were finding fault
with litigation --  the resolution of a community conflict-- there are
decisions, there are either/ors, there are commitment of resources.  There
are
people who are losers and who are winners.  And unless you
restructure that aspect of our life, I'm not certainly how close this link
between communicative discourse and binding decisions can be made.
<p>
 GUINIER:  Well, I'd be happy to talk to you about restructuring that
aspect of our decision-making as well.  But my point is you
have to start somewhere.  And I think it's really important that we give
ordinary people more of a stake in public discourse, more of a sense that
they
can participate.  It's very interesting the--and maybe, actually, James
Fishkin knows more about this than what was simply reported in the
newspapers,
but the presidential debate commission apparently convened 60 focus groups
to
listen to the debates and to help them in terms of structuring the
debates.
<p>
And what they found is that the people who are part of these focus groups
became so enthusiastic about simply the process of listening to these
debates
as a group and having an opportunity subsequent to the debates to actually
talk among themselves that they started to question:  Who was in charge of
the
debates?  And why were they making particular decisions?  And why is it
that
the political parties get to decide who's debating?
<p>
The sense of empowerment went beyond just their feeling that they could
actually speak to a sense that now they might have something to say about
the
structure of the debate itself.  And that's really the aspect that I'm
trying
to focus on.
<p>
ROBERT WIEBE:  It seems to me that we're talking at two levels and that
maybe we either can't talk at both levels at the same time or we need to
do
something to mediate between them. Tom Bender gave us the sweeping
picture of, in effect, the nation--the whole political process across the
country.  You offered us a very small-scale model of problem-posing and
problem-solving.  It may be that the kinds of things that were at issue in
the
thinning of the political process have to do with the removal of most of
the
critical decision-making in people's lives from that small-scale model
you're
describing and that, to flip it around, if we want to empower people, if
we
want people to get engaged, we're going to have to find ways of literally
empowering them; that is, giving to the people who are discussing
the power to make the decisions that will affect the outcome.
<p>
Simply to talk about the issues only generates that desire to have some
say in
the making of those decisions.  And I think we need to reckon with the
issue
of scale; that is, the issue of scale is a critical one when we are
talking
about what community means, how those people who have not had a say--at
all
levels, not just the weakest and the poorest--but who haven't had a say in
the
making of their own lives can, in fact, have that say.  So I think if we
could
almost get the two of you to look one another in the eye and
to begin to mediate--there is a way in which the two of you are talking at
the
opposite ends of an issue that we haven't yet bridged as a group.
<p>
BENDER:  Actually, this isn't precisely an answer of scale, but
it's--it says something about the way we do and don't solve problems.  I
first
met Lani several years ago when she came to NYU and gave a talk about the
question of the winner-take-all kind of majoritarianism we have.  And in
the course of the discussion there, we talked a lot about the Reagan-Bush
strategy 
of creating these predominantly black election districts, so that black
candidates 
would be elected.  And it seemed to me, I don't know what Lani's view on
this.
This is all on my own.  I've implicated Lani.
<p>
Stimulating the thought is that what it seems to me that did was ensured
that
people didn't have to reach across the sort of established conventional,
even
stereotypical kinds of boundaries, whereas a strategy--hers is one, but
one
could have others, I suppose -- even within the large scale of
congressional or state assembly or whatever kinds of districts, that are
understood to, in fact, be more useful if they are more diverse.  There
may
then have to be other kinds of strategies to make sure that any one group
is
not systematically excluded.  But our approach is one that, again, shut
off important kinds of conversation.  And the fact that it was by a very
conservative set of administrations means that there may have been other
things going on even more perverse, but I won't...
<p>
RODIN:  ...(unintelligible) Cass, I'll just go around the room.
<p>
CASS SUNSTEIN:  Yeah.  There's one area where there's a lot of careful
empirical work
on the differences between ordinary judgments and expert judgments.  And
this does bear directly on, I think, what's going on between the two of
you.
It's in the area of risk.  And laypeople rank risks in a way that is
very different from the way experts rank risks.
<p>
For example, ordinary people think toxic waste dumps are the worst
problem.  And experts think that's the least significant problem.
Ordinary people aren't much concerned about indoor air pollution.  Experts
are
very much concerned about indoor air pollution.  Now if you look at the
differences in the rankings, you might ask yourself, `What does the
American
system react to, the experts or the public judgments?'  And the answer is
clear.  It's the public judgments.  Which means--Lani refers to  Justice
Breyer, and he's very much concerned about this--that we devote tremendous
resources to small problems and no resources to large problems.
<p>
And this isn't what I think where we'd say we want more participatory
democracy if we understand it in the non-Fishkin sense of opinion polls.
We
have that, and that results in wasted expenditures and deaths.  So what
we'd
want to get at, I think, is what underlies the difference between
laypeople
and experts.  And one of those things is sharp disagreements on the facts,
which experts have access to and ordinary people don't.  Now there may be
some
dimensions of difference that are kind of qualitative differences among
risks, 
but it would be good to get that open.  Now this
leads to a more general suggestion.  That is that often, when there is
intense
political disagreement, at least in the American political system, 
we aren't clear on what the disagreement is a disagreement about.  And
a way of making progress on [a] kind of political culture is to try to
locate the
domain along which there is disagreement.
<p>
My hypothesis is, the only way to make progress on that issue is to get
more
particularistic and that often, the disagreement is a factual one and
often,
the disagreement is one about something much less abstract than appears.
So,
for example, when people disagree about affirmative action and feminism,
the
way to make no progress is to be very abstract about those things.  And
the
way to make a whole lot of progress is to be much more detailed and
concrete about what it is we're focused on.
<p>
When you talk about Lowell High School, I think, `Jeez, I don't even know
how to come to terms with this question before knowing what the number 59
reflects or the number 62 reflects or what the goal of Lowell
High School is,' which means that you have to know a lot of facts and a
lot of
details about its purpose.
<p>
So this is, I guess, a plea for identifying empirical questions as such in
democratic discussion.  That is exceedingly rare.  And it's tremendous
progress because it lowers volume and makes more likely the possibility of
progress.  When someone says, `We're disagreeing about the minimum wage
over
an empirical question,' then there might be a vulgar phrase, more light
and
less heat.  When affirmative action debates get more particularistic, then
there's more progress.  So this is a plea for more attention to the
factual dimension of disputes and more casuistry.
<p>
MICHAEL PIORE:  Well, I find it difficult to quite follow on what you
said, although I think that it's related.  I want to come back to
this question of experts.  It seems to me that the problem, in terms of
experts explaining their expert opinion, particularly at the moment in our
society, is that the experts see, as their constituency, not the public,
but
their own professional community.  And that's particularly strong in --
maybe
it's not particularly strong, but it's certainly strong in my own
profession,
which is the economics profession.  Where the whole, that is, economists
see a debate, but the debate is to other economists.  And even economists
in the public sector feel that their audience is the academic, scholarly
community, which is reinforced by the sense that economists who serve in
the
public return, that is, public service is a point in a professional life,
which is 
oriented towards the professional community.
<p>
My colleagues, in fact, I would be profoundly hurt by this notion that I
bring my expertise 
to the table without being willing to debate it.  But the debates in which
I'm
willing to engage and the debates that I see myself oriented to are not
the
debates which lead to explaining views to the public.  And somehow, I
see that related to what is almost a different question. We have a
tendency to take questions which are eminently public questions and turn
them into expert issues.
<p>
And the leading case of that at the moment, it seems to me, is Social
Security, which is really as profound a division in our society as the
racial division.  One would never think of taking the racial issues that
we face in this society and turning them over to a small expert commission 
which was going to depoliticize the issue.  But here you have an
issue that involves intergenerational distributions, that involves
distributions between different social classes, that involves basically,
the core of the income distribution.  And we're talking about
depoliticizing it and turning it over to a commission of experts, a
commission of experts who, if they have an expert opinion, are going to
reduce this issue to the question of the price index, which I doubt very
much,
could ever be an empirical issue.
<p>
Which leads me to the final point. I think it's really hard, at
least in my profession, to separate out a set of issues which could be
clearly
defined as empirical or factual and separate them out
from those aspects of the same issue which are basically political.
<p>
PAUL VERKUIL:  I think this is a very interesting debate between
expertise and other kinds of legitimacy.  And, Lani, it does seem to me
that when you describe your group, it works very well.  Even though they
are
arguably experts because they're being trained to be experts--legal
experts--they're behaving more as if they were all participants in a
mutually
shared process, and so the expertise is in the background.
But yet, we need it.  And Cass says the cure of problems of expertise is
more
expertise, basically, right?  And that may be one answer.
<p>
But the flaw with that is that the big word is `trust.'  And how do
we get around the fact that the more expert we become--and even Steve
Breyer
would say, `Look, we would--we should create an expert group in government
to
solve the really hard problems and to get past the differential between
public
views and expert views on major issues.'  But that gets a lot of
attack.  We don't trust people.  Now I don't know where that comes in, but
this is the entry point for the difference between everyone sitting
around together.  They trust each other because they've seen each other in
action in a non-threatening environment.  They've gotten together on
numerous
occasions and they have a basis upon which to communicate.  They don't
just
read an expert report.
<p>
Now experts have integrity and they have standards.  And we all, I guess,
almost everyone here has got to be qualified as an expert in something.
So we
must believe in ourselves.  But the irony is that what's the solution when
you
don't trust someone?  It is that you don't rely on experts.  You don't
care
about what the number 59 means.  What you do is, you create a lottery.
Now
that's the ultimate non-expert solution, but it's the only one people
trust.
It's the only one.  I mean, that's how we solved the problem of the draft
in
Vietnam, when you think about it.  It was the most intractable problem we
had
because we knew the "right people," quote, unquote, were either getting in
or
getting out.  And so the the lottery, which is the most irrational act of
all, became the only thing we could accept.
<p>
The lottery is still with us, I mean, in a lot of dimensions.  But there
ought
to--maybe it's the alternative between the expertise and the lottery.
And I would favor expertise somehow.  Because if we
were really honest, you know--you have been through a college admissions
committee meeting, Madame President?  You know, at the end of the day, why
not
just take these kids and say, `By lottery, because they're all basically
the same.  
You know what I mean?  We do this game.  What do we get out of it?  
One way or the other those are two different ways of viewing the world.
<p>
RODIN:  Jay, you had your...
<p>
JAY ROSEN:  I had two comments.  First on this question of expertise.  My
understanding of how Dewey tried to go at the problem was to break
expertise
down into two related but different terms.  One is experiment and the
other is
intelligence.  He was in a favor of a democracy of experiment in which
expertise comes to play a lot of different roles that people are trying
out,
lots of different solutions.  And to some degree that addresses this
problem.  Intelligence was something he thought was broadly distributed.
Everybody has intelligence.  Everybody doesn't have expertise.  If we
valued
intelligence more broadly throughout the culture, we would begin to
address
that problem.
<p>
I thought another answer to the expertise problem is in Tom's
notion of public work.  If people have work to do, then they put
expertise to use in a different way, summarized neatly in the idea of
experts
on tap, not on top.  So if you have a task to do, then you use experts
on tap, not on top.
<p>
Now that leads me to my second point, which is about this commission.  And
I'm
trying to listen to this discussion, thinking about, `Well, what could
this commission do about these things?'  And it seems to me that one of
the
things that we're very good at, because of the nature of our job,
especially
those of us who are academics, is, we have a sense of what constitutes a
good
problem.  Meaning that all the particulars are kind of in there.  All the
difficulties are 
in there.  And one of the things that distinguishes academics is that they
like problems.  
You see?  Whereas most people consider problems to be difficulties.  So we
are this weird
group of people who enjoy good problems, and we enjoy them for exactly
the opposite reason, which is that they're difficult, right?
<p>
So when Lani says, `Well, I took that problem back to my class,' to me
this is the most interesting thing that's been said so far today.  `I took
that problem...'  Why did she take it back to her class?  Because it was a
good
problem, right?  It had everything that you wanted to discuss in the class
in
it and it was linked to the real world, right?  It was linked to a real
decision, and you knew that your class could do something interesting
about
it.  Now all of us have that capacity in different ways.  In other words,
over
the [next] two years, which I understand, we're going to be meeting,
you know, we can all take that problem back to our �blank� and maybe
that's
what such a commission is supposed to be about.
<p>
Now when Lani did that, she had picked out what I'm calling a `good
problem.'
So part of what the work of the commission might involve is identifying
good
problems throughout the culture for this particular set of concerns that
we're
engaged in, meaning places where, let's say, a public of some kind has to
make
a decision where it is linked in some way to actions, not just talk, where
there are likely to be these conflicts about discourse and diversity that
we have been concerned about, where some kind of intervention might make a
difference and where we could begin to experiment, as Lani has in her
class,
with all the things we're talking about.
<p>
The fact is that throughout the culture, these kinds of situations come up
over and over again.  The one that Jim mentioned, you know, the
Presidential
Commission on Debates.  How should these debates be structured?  That was
a
practical decision that had to be made.  It was linked to a very specific
deed, which was how these debates were going to be organized.  They did
the
focus group method, but they didn't really empower a public to make the
decisions.  If they had empowered the public, then we would have had all
these
problems that we're talking about come into play.  So part possibly, part
of what this commission could do is identify, in many different levels and
areas of societies, these good problems where the whole thing is present,
some
sense of what would constitute a challenging response to it, some sense of
what would constitute, as Lani tried to do, a good outcome--Right?--and
take
it back and study it.  You know, maybe we're the people who should be
identifying where these kinds of problems arise in the world and point it
to
them and saying, `There it is.  There's the problem of civility.  Let's
make
sure it doesn't go untreated.'
<p>
RODIN:  Martin, you were next.
<p>
MARTIN MARTY:  I think we have to throw in still one other element
beside public and expert, and that is leader, or someone who's an expert
at
leadership, as an introducer of complications that can result in both
empowerment and incivility, back to this morning's term.
<p>
Neil Smelser's early work, old classics like Craine Brenton and
others, show how, at a certain stage in social movements, the leader gives
the
people a problem, gives you a name for a problem.  And that's empowering.
You can't do it without that.  But you can also bring them into a
stage where, without having learned rules of argument or conversation,
they
only complicate things.
<p>
Just a very quick little reference.  My late first wife and I took in a
lot of
foster children, very often Hispanics from Chicago, and there would always
come a stage, about age 13 or 14 when they'd come by and say, `You know,
you're about on schedule to have an identity crisis.'  They were in a
largely
non-Hispanic school.  They're kind of--president of their class; they're
cheerleaders; they're doing all these things.  `About time you have an
identity crisis,' and by god, they got an identity crisis.  And pretty
soon,
we had one, too.  Now I couldn't play patriarch and say, `You shouldn't
have that identity crisis.'  But suddenly, they have to learn Hispanic
Spanish
for the first time in their life.  They got into all kinds of
things along the way.  I think they were probably better off, but
immediately,
they [had an], identity problem.
<p>
Now taking that over in a field that I study--the religious left in the
'60s,
religious right nowadays--most Americans live with a great deal of
fluidity on
the religious realm.  They're denominational; they're paradenominational;
they're agnostic; they're spiritual.  They're all these fuzzy things.
They
can believe 23 competitive ideas at the same time.  And then somebody
comes
along and says, `You got to sign up for our movement.  We'll give you the
name
of the enemy, prochoice, or whatever it is,� and very suddenly, you take
people out of that.  And they don't really gain a lot out of it and
they've not learned 
anything except how to do Operation Rescue, how to do these disruptive
things.
<p>
So I think we have to ask the question about types of expertise in
leadership.  I don't want to take away the leader who gives the identity
problem.  People were unempowered till they came along.  But with that
often doesn't come the teaching of or the imparting of the skills at then
joining as a protest movement the conversation and the argument.
<p>
RODIN:  I'm looking to this side and I don't want to miss this side.
<p>
AMY GUTMANN:  It seems to me that a couple of things have come out
of this discussion that are better seen not as dichotomous, but within a
picture that would have to be broader in order to be more complete.  I
mean, I
just want to take off from a theme of Lani's talk.  One
of the themes, it seems to me, of what Lani was saying is that unlike what
is
conveyed in a court of law, where we swear on the Bible to tell the truth,
the
whole truth and nothing but the truth, it's very unlikely that for complex
social problems, any one person, whether it be an expert or any one group,
has, by himself or herself or by that group itself, the truth, the whole
truth
and nothing but the truth.
<p>
Now I think the point Cass was making is that sometimes, experts have some
information that would help us go further in resolving a difficult
problem.
However, it would be a mistake, and I don't think Cass was suggesting
this, to
say that would be a reason to trust the experts to make the decision.
Unaccountable expertise is something that we've long ago, I hope, learned
is a
very dangerous phenomenon.  And if democracy has one thing to be said for
it,
it is that when it works well, it prevents experts from being
unaccountable.
<p>
Now one of the problems is, our democracy hasn't worked all that well in
that
regard.  And one of the things Jim Fishkin was pointing out is, the
primary
system, as it works now, is not a recipe for accountability.  It doesn't
hold
candidates accountable to platforms or to virtually anything but the
results
of a one-time-only public opinion poll, and that happens on the
presidential
level every four years, so that's not very good.  So what I get out of
this is that the source of our disagreements is multiple.  That is,
economists will begin with scarce resources and then we can add, a la
David
Hume, limited generosity, which experts share as well as anybody.  And so
we
can't trust anybody to be unaccountable.
<p>
And then, Lani's case is a wonderful case of incompatible values.  There
are
lots of different values Lowell High School could share, and there isn't
going
to be one--likely, one right answer.  And, finally, the one that academics
are
least likely to admit is incomplete understanding.  I dare say that one of
the
problems of many of the issues, including Social Security, that we're up
against is that when you bring the experts and the people--all the
people--
together, we still don't have a crystal ball to predict.  So the--for me,
one
of the things that comes out of this conversation is that a certain kind
of
humility of any group deciding by itself and the value--this is the
positive
value--we've been talking about a lot of negative values--the positive
value
of trying to get as many people together to the table as
possible in the hopes that something better will come out of it.  And I've
often wondered, after a certain point in admissions, that maybe a lottery
would be better than what I and what all my colleagues know.  So I
wouldn't
rule out lotteries as part of better answers in some cases.
<p>
MARI FITZDUFF: I think we need to be very careful.  I think,
frankly, expertise rarely solves a situation or a problem.  My experience
has
been that it's been politics and politicians, and I think there is a real
dilemma here.  Frankly, in Northern Ireland, we have thousands of
solutions to
the Northern Ireland problem, just as Lani's class had dozens of solutions
to
the Lowell High problem.  So there is a real dilemma here, I think, for
the commission.  There is a question about whether politicians actually
want
to empower people or to gain votes.
<p>
And I think for the commission, the test will be for you, if
politicians--they
can either see you as a threat and, therefore, you will perhaps have begun
to
affect the way they change and the way they think about things, or you
need to
engage with them.  Because if the commission is going to be successful, it
is
going to change the way in which politics possibly happen.  And I think
that's
something you need to take account of in the beginning, because if you
don't
actually engage with those who have the power within our society from the
very
beginning, they will see it as your solution rather than their solution.
So
it is just a caution to engage as we go with those who actually can
deliver.
Frankly, experts rarely can.  We're not usually strategic enough.
<p>
LAWRENCE LESSIG:  I want to follow through what Professor Guttman was
saying, because I think she brings out an an important ambiguity here in
how we're thinking about the use to which we are making experts or
deliberation or, as Lani was talking about in the very beginning,
adversarial
systems.  I mean, if you think about the adversarial system in the context
of
a courtroom, it's ambiguous between two different functions.
<p>
One is adversarial system to--in arguing to the judge, who is a single
decisionmaker who will then make a decision one way or the other vs.
adversarial decision leading to a decision that a jury must make, where a
jury
is the beginning--at the end of the lawyers' speeches, the juries then
begin a
process of deliberation, where they take the reasons given and they're
locked
up in a room and they must come up with an answer after a period of time.
<p>
Now the nature of the adversarial discussion is probably very different
in those two different contexts.  The argument to the judge is very much
like modern politics, where it's an argument that is to people sitting in
their living rooms watching television which they then will go out
and cast a ballot without further deliberation vs. an argument to a group
or
a collective, like Lani Guinier was describing her class as, where the
argument is a first step to a discussion where the discussion is among
people who must come to some kind of conclusion.  So you
ended with a reference to Tocqueville's conception of a public needing
something to do.
<p>
Of course, the other model Tocqueville had, which was quite fascinating, 
was the public of the jury, which is not just something to do, but no
choice except to do it or they were going to be locked up until they
finished
their job.  And that's the sense, excuse me, the sense of community
which makes it possible for these types of deliberations to actually come
to
some kind of resolution.  The sense that they have a project and
they have no choice just to get out of it, just to walk away from it.  And
in
a sense, this model of deliberation, which I think is at the core of what
a
lot of people have been saying, where people feel they must come up with
an answer, they're going to use experts in coming up with the answer, but
just
as one input.  They're going to use the evidence which they see, but they
just
must come to some conclusion in a context of equality and deliberation.
<p>
It's that model that I think we need to think about replicating.  Because,
of
course, juries have failed in 1,000 ways in America today, but
there's something about it as a model of deliberation that can be
re-created
in different contexts.  When you talk about the 17,000 organizations that
exist in New York for local community work--well, there are 17,000 juries,
in
a sense, which can be given particular kinds of questions and--and given
the
sense that they have a job and their job is to resolve a problem.  And
they'll
take evidence and then they'll make a decision.  And they don't finish
until
they've made that decision.  That's the sense of deliberation which I
think
is very different.
<p>
RODIN:  Make a decision and then have to live with the consequences of
carrying it out.  I mean, we've talked about three different levels when
we merely meet to have a conversation, which has a certain level of value.
The second, that you articulated, where there has to be some conclusion
and
some decision.  And to that, I think, an important third, which is the
decision has to have real and tangible consequences for the individuals
making
it.
<p>
JOHN SKRENTNY:  I just wanted to make a comment about the
discussion of experts and how important they are in resolving these
disputes.
And I think that throughout most of our discussion, we've overestimated
how much the people who are doing all this shouting and supposed
incivility--how much they really know about the world and the issues that
they're shouting about.
<p>
I don't know if people saw, a year ago or so, The Washington Post ran this
great series of public-opinion-poll data that showed that white Americans
think that only 49 percent of the American population is white. White
Americans 
believe that only 49 percent of America is white.  The actual answer is
about 78 percent. 
Pollsthat show how much Americans think their federal budget is going
toward
welfare showed that--or toward foreign aid is--is much, much higher than
it is
in actuality.  And we're talking here about experts and they're adding
information to the debate and helping resolve some of these issues.
<p>
Back to a point that was made earlier, I mean, some of the times, it's
just the most basic pieces of information that could resolve a lot of
the incivility and the conflict here.  It's not an expert that is needed
to tell Americans that 77 percent of the population or 76 percent is
white.
I'm talking here about much broader kinds of knowledge that could
resolve some of these disputes.  Experts aren't even a part of the
equation in some of these things.

<p>
RODIN:  Don.
<p>
DON RANDEL:  I fear the problem is somewhat more difficult even than
that, because when we think about the kinds of issues that are posed by
the
relationship among terms like `society,' `culture,' `community,' the
things
that have the potential to sort of render us asunder as societies or
cultures
or communities, the argument is in considerable degree about what will
constitute the relevant expertise.  That is, who certifies that the
expertise
being brought to bear is, in fact, the right set of expertise?  And here I
think we have to go back to a remark that Claude Steele made this morning,
which captured something about what is at stake in any of these disputes?
That is--I mean, in the case of Lowell High School, it is the parent who
is
the sole and only expert on the welfare of his/her child and is not
prepared
to accept any other body of expertise as comparable to that.
<p>
Similarly, in a debate about access to cultural institutions, education
institutions and so forth, which might be carried on in more or less civil
fashion, a lot will depend on what is at stake in terms of the standing of
the
person making the claim.  We would want to know with respect to that
claim, `What is their economic position?' the point that Professor Steele
was
making.  But as we look around at other kinds of disputes that have lethal
potention, it's not about economics alone, but it's, `Who is
the relevant expert on who gets to go to heaven?' say, and a whole series
of
things.
<p>
In this respect, I think we probably don't get Martin Seligman's wish to
fence
off certain things from a kind of relativism, because we might say that we
should cling, ultimately, to some criterion of subtlety of argument or
something of this sort, which we wouldn't wish to concede on.  And
yet--you'll
pardon me for mentioning music--this is a lot like thinking about musical
criticism.  I can give you the most profound argument about why it is that
Johan Nepomuch Shleperman made the best modulations to the subdominant of
anybody, and it's not going to help you decide that Shleperman is better
than
Beethoven or whoever your favorite composer has to be.  So that the
criteria for what constitutes subtle argument themselves project the
outcome
of the argument.
<p>
EDNA ULMMANN-MARGALIT:  I want to, I think, complicate the picture even
more, somehow, politics isn't--didn't get into that.  I mean, sheer power
struggles.  It's one thing to talk about facts and experts and
information,
but there are interests and there is politics and there are
symbolic values sometimes to the decisions.  I want to share with you,
very
briefly, a story that maybe, you know, is at least as interesting as the
Lowell High School.  It's a case that tore Jerusalem apart just a
few weeks ago.  And when I came here, I actually prepared a whole pile of
newspaper clippings just about this one story.  I have a whole huge thing;
most of it is in Hebrew.  But it's recent and it's real.  And I'm
not quite sure what we're going to do with it.  But here's the story.
<p>
There's a street in Jerusalem where most of the residents who live along
the street are religious and want it closed on Shabbat, but it's a main
artery.  And streets don't belong to the people who live there, right?  I
mean, legally, they're not entitled to close it.  There are arrangements,
long-standing arrangements in Jerusalem where inside neighborhoods which
are
religious, streets are closed on Shabbat, on Saturday.  But this is a main
artery, and this is a new demand and it violates a so-called status quo
which
has been observed for many, many years.  And this has become an extremely
violent issue.  There were demonstrations there every week, occupying
thousands of police.  They were trying to block traffic there; traffic
wasn't
going anywhere.  Anyway, and it became a hugely explosive issue and
people just didn't know what to do with it.
<p>
And the way this particular thing was hoped to be resolved was by
appointing a commission.  And I think that this commission was actually
going
to do very much what Cass was arguing against.  And I think this was
really a
grave mistake.  They were not only empowered or the mandate
was not just to solve the problem of that particular artery, but to come
up
with a solution to the problem of Saturdays in Israel, in public
transportation in general.
<p>
And they had a series of people coming as expert witnesses.
They brought the former famous mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, who
started
with a very emotional presentation.  I am sure many of you read about
it--and, I
mean, I'm sure some of it was reported here.  You know, the nature of the
capital of Israel and can the secular population agree that the city will
be
taken over by the religious and then the seculars would leave, and there
were
projections about how many people would leave the city.  And, in fact,
there
are people who are leaving the city because of these problems.  And part
of
the problem there is that it's a struggle between two communities, one of
which believes in tolerance and believes in compromise and believes in
reason
giving and believes in rationality and believes in argument, and the other
group sets no value to either democracy or toleration or arguments or
anything.  They just have the truth on their side.  And they have
Saturday,
and they have laws and they have the Torah, and they don't give a--they
don't
give a--you know, they don't care at all about it.
<p>
I'm a guest here.  I can't do that.  So the result, 
of course, a real political power struggle.  The composition of
the commission, in fact, determined the result.  It was three so-called
seculars and three so-called religious.  But even there, they had to
balance
so many fine balances between--you know, seculars had to be right-wing and
left-wing and the religious had to be Hasidic and Lithuanian, whatever.
So it was a very, very delicate balancing act.  It could lead nowhere.  It
was
a very dissatisfactory solution.
<p>
They did decide to close the road on Saturdays, but to close it only 
on prayer times.  But it's very clear since it's a very long street and a
big one, 
that prayer hours vary.  So it means really it's closing it throughout the
Saturday.  
And it's clear that that's not the end of the story, but it was the end of
that particular commission.  But it got very high visibility.  It became a
national issue, not just a Jerusalem issue, a national and, in a way,
international.
<p>
And I think it could be--I'm not quite sure what--you know, what the
lesson I
want to draw from this--for this commission, but I do have a sense that I,
at
least, want to be clearer how this kind of real conflict, which involves a
lot
of emotion, a lot of interests, a lot of power struggle and symbolic
values,
etc., when we talk about culture, community, cultural warfare.  What are
the
ways to think about such problems in a community?  And I'm not sure that a
good process is what is required.  I have a very--somewhat more skeptical
view
about, you know, idolizing the good processes and the empowering.
Sometimes
what you need are good results.  And sometimes a good process can lead to
a good result, but the process itself is not, sometimes, the very main
value.
And I'm just throwing this on the table with the hope that maybe some
insight
can come in.
<p>
RODIN:  Well, I think it's fascinating.  And I'm sure we'll come back to
it, as we talk about some of these community experiences tomorrow
afternoon.  But one point that you made, I think, is extremely significant
for
this conversation, and that is, a process doesn't work if, in fact, there
are
people--one group of whom or some of whom believe in dialogue and
process--process and debate, and the other--others of whom simply do not,
who
believe that truth is on their side and they won't hear or be persuaded
by or tolerate dialogue.  And then how do we get to the kind of process
that
Lani or others, as is really, at least, one step towards helping us to
resolve
some of these issues?
<p>
Why don't we take a brief break?  And we'll come back, and I'll turn this
over
to Cass Sunstein.  Thank you, Tom, and Lani in absentia.
