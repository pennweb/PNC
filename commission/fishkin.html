<p>


<p>
MARTIN MARTY:  We're now ready for Professor James Fishkin.  Many of you
last
winter
on PBS saw his National Issues Convention, which he conceived, and
anyway, he's the Darrell K. Royal Regents chair and chair of the
Department of Government at the University of Texas.  The key word is
deliberative polling.  He has PhDs from Yale and Cambridge.  He's
written "Democracy & Deliberation" and "A Voice of the People."
I think we're going to see a formatted clip as part of your presentation.
<p>
JAMES FISHKIN:  Right.  But can I talk first?
<p>
MARTY:  Yes.
<p>
FISHKIN:  And then go to...
<p>
MARTY:  You do as you wish.
<p>
FISHKIN:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't possibly say as
much  as she said in such a short period of time.
and I didn't know this was compacted in 15 minutes, so I'll just
cover a few highlights and maybe raise questions.  I've got a method,
which I call deliberative polling.  Ordinary polls offer a snapshot of
public opinion as it is.  Deliberative polling is meant to do
something else.  It's meant to offer a representation of what the
public would think if it actually had a better chance to think about it.
<p>
I think in developing it, I was motivated by, as Cass said earlier,
the problem of rational ignorance, as coined by Anthony Downs.  That
is, if I've got one vote in millions, why should I pay a lot of
attention to the complexities of public policy or the positions of
competing candidates, because my vote won't make much difference?
It's lamentable.  We'd like citizens to really spend a lot of time and
effort engaging in not only acquiring information, but discussing
the issues and hearing alternative points of view and confronting the
trade-offs.  But they have little incentive to do that.
<p>
And a second defect in public opinion, as it normally enters the
policy process and the political process, as Phil Converse
demonstrated years ago, is that sometimes public opinion polls--which,
ironically, George Gallup originally thought of as a real democratic
reform set in 1938 would put the entire country in one room under
conditions where it could think, but it actually reports the entire
country in one room was the media sending out messages to listeners
and they're being bounced back by the opinion polls.
<p>
It actually reports opinions where the public has little reason to
think and sometimes not even have an opinion at all.  Congress
established what were called `non-attitudes,' which, for me, were
dramatized by the recent effort of The Washington Post to redo the
famous study of the Public Affairs Act in 1975, where a third of the
public had opinions about the Public Affairs Act of 1975, even though
it was fictional, so The Washington Post decided to redo it,
celebrating the 20th un-anniversary of the non-existent Public Affairs
Act of 1975 by asking what the public thought about the repeal of
the  Public Affair [Act].
<p>
And half the sample was told President Clinton wanted the repeal and
half the new Republican Congress wanted the repeal.  Depending on just
that little bit of information--just that little
bit--you got quite different results as to who supported
it and who was opposing it.  Now who was for something and who was
against something is information, if it were true, but it's a very
little bit of information, but it's fully enough for people to take
the step of offering an opinion about it, even if they're offered
every chance to say that they don't know and that it's OK not
to because people don't want to feel stupid responding during a poll.
They don't like to admit they don't have an answer. <p>

So there are two things that, in my view,
have led to a superficial form of mass democracy:  television and
public opinion polling and their interaction--this kind of thin
sound-bite democracy.  I've now tried to channel those forces in a
more constructive way with deliberative polling, harnessing
the desire of people to be on television as part of the sample.
I mean, our people, hopefully, aren't terrorists in any
more proportion of the population, but whether they're--whatever
the--or the talk show, the effort of the kind of desire of
people to be on television with talk shows--well, if you set up norms
where people--the whole point is that people are supposed to behave
more like ideal citizens, and that's what they're supposed to do when
they're on television.
<p>
You can actually get them both to come in quite representative ways
and to behave like ideal citizens.  And then we can do the experiment:
What would the country think about the issues if people were motivated
to behave like ideal citizens and, indeed, come to a considered
judgment because, in anticipation of the event, they spend a great
deal of time thinking about it?
<p>
The first deliberative poll was conducted by Channel 4 in Britain.  I
couldn't get PBS quite to pull it off.  And I was on
sabbatical in Britain, in Cambridge, where I'd been a student in
1991, '92.  And I talked Channel 4, a commercial television network,
into the notion that they should do
it in the election.  Working back, they said, `We can't try it in the
election without seeing if it works.' And so we tried it on an issue
of crime, which was on the political agenda, and we took a
national random sample of the British people, brought them to a single
place where they could think about the issue, have a dialogue with
competing politicians, including Tony Blair at the time, competing
experts, small-group discussions where they would clarify the key
questions that they wanted to ask the competing experts and
politicians.
<p>
But the small-group discussions were where the change took place,
which is rational dialogue of a certain sort, rational dialogue framed
in terms that ordinary people can relate to with good information.
The group discussion is where the change took place.  And so abstract
discussion may not [be] where people actually bring their own life
experiences to bear, can lead to very significant opinion change.
<p>
And the process--there's a woman who came up to me on the first one
that we did, and she said she wanted to thank me;  
she was a spouse accompanying her husband.  And she said in 30 years of
marriage her husband had never read a newspaper, but from the moment
he was invited to this he began to read, she said, every newspaper
every day.  He was going to be much more interesting to live with in
retirement.  But for me this sort of capsulized the fact that we
created incentives for someone to behave more like an ideal citizen
and come to a considered judgment.  We went back to these people nine
months later and we found that, yes, their knowledge at the end of the
weekend was much higher than at the point of first recruitment,
and nine months later, their knowledge was even much higher again.  So
we activated them to be ideal citizens.
<p>
And, indeed, on the American one, NORC did an
experimental study with random samples viewing this thing, and they
found a tremendous, I say, found a statistically significant
increase in the sense of citizen engagement, and they found this was a
kind of dissolver of cynicism among even people who were just viewing
it, because it attempted to reframe the issues in terms that ordinary
people could understand.  It's a kind of poll with a human face.  It
has the concreteness and immediacy of a focus group or
discussion group, but the national representativeness of a national
random sample.
<p>
The man who selected the first sample for the deliberative poll, who I
work with, Roger Jollett, SCPR, said he'd selected thousands of
national random samples but he'd never seen one.  No one had never
seen one because, for most purposes, you never would bring them
together because once they come together, they talk to each other,
they learn from each other and there's a dialogue across all these
divisions. <p>

In the British one on crime we had a criminal in the sample--we had
several criminals in the sample.  I mean, we didn't know, but it was a
good random sample and it was attributed to the civility of the
dialogue that the criminals--so they went around the room, `What do
you do for a living?' And this one guy said he's a car thief.  Well,
he added something to the dialogue.  He knew about crime, he had
been to prison, he knew it wasn't a holiday camp.  And that was a
voice in the dialogue that made it more real.  Some
people said, `This whole thing's artificial'; I think it's more real
than the kind of artificial concoctions of sound bite television.
<p>
In any case, we do a baseline poll, we invite them
all to come for the weekend, and attitudinally and demographically
we've got amazingly good representation.  We can evaluate the
representativeness of the weekend microcosm.  I mean, we did a lot of
work.  NORC had to do things like, you know, a woman on a farm
in Alabama couldn't come because she didn't want to leave her
cow.  There was no one to milk her cow.  NORC sent out a researcher to
milk her cow during the weekend, and it was very representative.  A
quarter of the sample have incomes under $20,000; 200 of the people
had never flown on an airplane before; one woman said that she
came because she thought there'd be hot water in the hotel.  But once
she came she was very much involved.  We were shameless.  We
used everything we could to get them to participate in the weekend.
And once they came, they changed in dramatic and coherent ways; they
were more informed, they were more consistent.  And the result, I
think, it's a representation of what the public would
think if it had a chance to think about it.
<p>
And to show you I haven't hallucinated and let me just
show you about four minutes from the MacNeil-Lehrer version in
January because it's much better if you've seen something
rather than just my describing it.  I'll show you that and make one or
two comments, then I'll get off the stage.
<p>
MARTY:  OK.  Will there be a wanted sign under the car thief?
<p>
FISHKIN:  What?
<p>
MARTY:  Will there be a wanted sign under the car thief?
<p>
FISHKIN:  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, the...
<p>
MARTY:  Let me know if you want a rewind.
<p>
FISHKIN:  OK.  You mean, he thinks it might 
not be at exactly where I gave it to him.  Roll
forward?  I don't know; well, play it.  Let's see-- OK.  That's
fine.  That's fine.
<p>
(Excerpt from videotape)
<p>
Unidentified Man #1:  (Joined in progress) ...in Austin talking about
the issues.  "Newshour" correspondent Tom Beard reports on them and
what they did and heard. <p>

SANDRA FERGUSON (Social Studies Teacher, Simi Valley,
California):  Number two, we're looking at generosity.  We think...
<p>
TOM BEARD reporting:
<p>
Sandra Ferguson was thrilled to be selected to travel to Austin,
Texas, to participate in a polling experiment.
<p>
FERGUSON:  It's kind of exciting, something new.
<p>
BEARD:  This social studies teacher from Simi Valley, California, was
one of nearly 500 people who were invited to attend the National
Issues Convention.  They were being asked to participate in what its
inventor is calling `a deliberative poll.'
<p>
Unidentified Man #2:  From which source do you get most of your news
information, newspapers or television?
<p>
BEARD:  This is an experiment where people's opinions are sampled just
like a traditional poll.  But it goes further.  People are brought
together to read about and discuss the issues intensively.  Their
opinions are sampled afterwards to see if they've changed.  The
National Issues Convention is the creation of Professor James Fishkin,
who teaches democratic theory at the University of Texas.
<p>
FISHKIN:  Instead of a top-of-the-head impression of
shrinking sound bites and headlines, people will really have a chance
to get good information, hear opposing points of view and come to a
considered judgment.  And so this represents what the country would
think if it were really engaged in the issues.
<p>
BEARD:  Fishkin enlisted the aid of pollsters from the National
Opinion Research Center to select the citizen delegates that attended
the event.  Two months ago they went door to door to over 1,200
randomly selected addresses throughout the country.  The interviewers
asked each participant about themselves and questions about the issues
facing America.
<p>
Unidentified Woman #1:  OK, what is your religious preference?  Is it
Protestant, Catholic, Jewish...
<p>
BEARD:  To qualify for the trip all they had to do was answer the
questions and be an adult US citizen.  Jim Terry, a poultry farmer
from Missouri, was invited to Austin; so was computer systems analyst
Vince DeVincenzo and Angela Harris, a nurse practitioner from
Nashville.  In nearly every way they represented the American
population, although there were somewhat more Westerners and fewer
elderly.  But they ranged in age from 18 to 84, and by gender, race
and political affiliation they accurately reflected the nation.
Fifty-two percent were female and 48 percent were male; slightly more
than three-quarters white, 13 percent African-American, 6 percent
Hispanic.  And political party preference almost exactly like the
general public. <p>

Many delegates like Jim Terry came from small towns.  Terry lives in
Minnette, Missouri, population 6,500.  He's a conservative Republican,
as were 15 percent of the delegates.
<p>
JIM TERRY (Missouri Poultry Farmer):  Nothing like this ever
happened to us before, and it's exciting.  And we shared--probably
made up of about every walk of life, where people live, you know.  I
doubt if you'll see very many poultry farmers down there.
<p>
BEARD:  Ann Williams calls herself a liberal Democrat, as
did 10 percent of the delegates.  She lives in Boulder, Colorado, and
is a clerk in the district court.  Williams is a single parent with
two college-age children.  Like some, she was curious about what she
would find in Austin.
<p>
ANN WILLIAMS (District Court Clerk, Boulder, Colorado):  I am
interested in how conservatives think.  I don't understand why they
think the way they do at all.  I'm--I'm fairly liberal in my beliefs,
and I would like them to explain to me why they believe what they do.
<p>
BEARD:  For Vince DeVincenzo, the wish was that politicians and
candidates would pay attention.
<p>
VINCE DeVINCENZO (Computer Systems Analyst):  I hope that
politicians are going to listen to what the people are saying.  I
don't think they listen to what people say.  Unless you're, like, a
lobbyist or something like that--if you're, you know, Joey out in the
street, I don't think they really care.
<p>
JONATHAN LANCASTER:  It looks like a real nice team of delegates
here. <p>

Unidentified Delegate:  Hi.
<p>
LANCASTER:  I'm Jonathan Lancaster.  Hello.
<p>
BEARD:  When they arrived last week the excitement and expectations
were evident.  Angela Harris had just survived her first plane ride
and Sandra Ferguson was looking forward to meeting all the different
people at the convention.
<p>
Unidentified Man #3:  What are you excited about?
<p>
FERGUSON:  I think maybe having some role in this, that this is
really what--going to turn out to be some kind of an historic event,
like the first--first one-of-a-kind kind of a convention where the
public can really have some input into politics. <p>

BEARD:  The delegates got down to business the next morning.  They
broke down into 30 small groups and spent nine hours talking.  Chicken
farmers and schoolteachers, barbers and lawyers talked about the
economy, about the family, about foreign policy, and they came up with
questions they wanted the presidential candidates to answer.  On
Saturday night they got their chance.  Senator Richard Lugar was there
in person.  Lamar Alexander, Senator Phil Gramm and Steve Forbes
joined the convention via satellite.  The next day the Democrats got
their turn when Vice President Al Gore came to Austin to answer
questions and listen to the delegates.
<p>
Man #3:  There were three...
<p>
(End of excerpt)
<p>
FISHKIN:  Yeah.  I must be just about of time, right?  OrI have another
minute?
<p>
MARTY:  Indeed.
<p>
FISHKIN:  OK, thank you.  There...
<p>
MARTY:  You  have two minutes.
<p>
FISHKIN:  Oh, fantastic.  Thank you. <p>

There was a sense of people in the small groups were able
to communicate beyond a sound bite, you see.  So there was one group,
it was reported in the press, there was a black
welfare mother from New York and an 84-year-old white conservative
from Arizona who said at the very beginning of the discussion of the
family--he said to her, `You don't have a family.'--and he said,
`Well, a family means a father and a mother, and you're just a
mother.' And so this had a certain chilling effect on the group
discussion, but it's a facilitated group discussion.  At the end
of the weekend he came up to her and he said, `What are the three most
important words in the English language?  They're, `I was wrong.' And
this was written up in the paper, but it was just one of the examples.
<p>
There was a thing later, which I would have shown you if I had--I've
been in England planning the British one and I didn't have a chance to
select excerpts.  But there was a very dramatic discussion in the
discussion on the family, where this guy says,
`Well, if a kid drops out of school and he's
taking drugs, we should just wash our hands of him.
We can't do anything about it.' And this guy from the other
side of the room in the small-group discussion says, `Well, that was
me.' And then he describes how he was given a second chance and
then said, `What would do about that?' `Well, it's
not cost-effective to invest in'--well, the dialogue went on.  People
were offering reasons, but there was a sense in which some very
considerable mutual understanding was reached by the end because
people normally don't encounter people so different.  That is, the
thing that people got a great deal of satisfaction was this was the
entire country in one room and the small-group discussions were random
microcosms of the large microcosm.
<p>
And it was the very diversity of people --when the
12 people from Chicago arrived --well, the guy who picked them
up--we had hundreds of volunteers in this thing--said there were six
blacks and six whites and they sat on either side of the van and they
didn't talk to each other.  Well, the same van driver drove
them back and told me, `At the end of the weekend they were all like
one family because they'd been through this experience together.' And
so there was a great deal of mutual understanding and fellow
feeling, almost corny. <p>

However, one of the interesting things is Jay Rosen led a seminar of
the media about how to cover it, and there were about 350 newspaper
reporters there.  And they were all a lot of cynical
campaign reporters focused on the horse race.  And they came and
they didn't know what to do.  So they were told they could
sit in the back and watch the small-group discussions.  And they
watched America in microcosm changing its mind about a lot of issues,
in some ways moving left, in some ways moving right, but those terms
of reference didn't make any sense because the people were actually
talking about the substance of the issues with enough complexity to
come to grips with it.
<p>
I've got about 500 newspaper articles
in total about it.  And the interesting ones are the ones where they
actually covered them in the sort of the way you'd cover a focus
group.  But these were, in total, representative of
of the whole country and, indeed, indicative of where the
primary season would go, or so I would argue if I had another two
minutes.
<p>
In any case, the process is a way of reframing the issues.  It's a
poll with a human face that ordinary people can connect to.  And it's
a form of public consultation and a way to use
television to get an informed and representative voice of the people
into the public dialogue.
<p>
We're doing the British election this spring, on Channel 4.
MacNeil-Lehrer and I are working on another version of this, which we
hope to do on the future of Social Security next year, because we
think we can get a very interesting and informed dialogue across the
generations.  There have now been eight
deliberative polls, if you count the one that a newspaper did in
Minnesota statewide.  And we've done three local ones where we didn't
need an official airline; we had American Airlines.  But locally, you
know, it can be much cheaper.  So I see this as
one of several ways in which the media can be harnessed in a
constructive way and very much in the spirit of the stuff that Jay
Rosen is doing with civic journalism.
<p>
Maybe I should--I'll stop at that point.  Thank you.

<p>
MARTY:  Deliberative polling will likely enter all of our vocabularies.
Thank you very much.
