<b>SUMMARY OF FIRST MEETING (6/12/97)<br></b>
by William D. Boltz
<br>
<br>
<p>
The Working Group on 21st Century Community of the Penn National
Commission
on Society, Culture and Community  began its work by conducting a wide
ranging discussion on the nature and meaning of community.  Issues of
popular culture, values, civic spaces, and the arts, and their
relationships to concepts of community were all placed on the table.  The
group concluded by outlining  a series of questions to be investigated and
tasks to be performed.  These questions and tasks will be undertaken in a
three step process of exploration, definition and recommendation.
<p><b>
Exploration</b>
<p>
The first task for the group will be to investigate the types of
communities which exist or are emerging today.  This will be done through
approaches to states' humanities councils, surveys of the internet, and
communication with other groups working in this area.
<p>
The group will look at the goals communities pursue and the tasks they set
for themselves.  Members expressed interest in exploring communities of
purpose and affinity, as well as distinguishing those seeking positive
goals from those which exist for negative purposes (e.g., lynch mobs.)
Examples of successful and unsuccessful communities will be sought;
points
of commonality and difference will be determined.  This will allow the
group to develop models of community which will be the basis for much of
its later work.
<p>
During this phase, the working group will also seek to enlarge its
membership by going outside the confines of the PNC.  Expanding the
diversity of the group was seen as essential for the success of the
group's
efforts.

<p><b>
Definition<br><br></b>
Having acquired data and developed models, the group will seek definitions
for several key concepts and answers to major questions.  For example,
what
are the preconditions for community?  Among possible answers offered at
the
meeting were affection and common purpose or common values, myths and
norms.
<p>
A quality of openness to other groups was recognized as a positive feature
for subcommunities and  communities operating in a democratic society.
However, others noted that for some groups a degree of exclusivity is
central to the achievement of their goals.  What is the proper
relationship
between the need for communal exclusivity and openness to others?
<p>
What can be learned from racially or ethnically based communities?  Can
successes found in these groups be used by others trying to forge creative
linkages across such divides?
<p>
Communities that play a public role, either deliberative or active, will
be
especially important to the group as well as determining how more private
communities affect the larger civic community.
<p>
<b>
Recommendations</b>
<p>
The working group will initiate approaches in different areas.  Four
specific areas emerged from the discussions:
<ol>
<li><b>Internet</b><br><br>  The internet is forcing us all to rethink
many of
the
central
notions of community such as geographical proximity and temporal
commitment.  It is acting as a wellspring for new and often spontaneous
communities.  At the same time, it is feeding a culture of misinformation,
negativity, and incivility.  The working group will seek concrete ways to
make the internet a creative force for building  and sustaining community.
<br><br>
<li><b>"New Communities"</b><br><br>  In addition to the internet, new
forms of community are emerging all around us.  The group will actively
seek out groups, both in the US and abroad, which are seeking to form new
communities through unconventional techniques.  The role the arts can play
in bringing people from diverse backgrounds together will be emphasized.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Universities</b><br>
<br>
  University communities were held up as exemplars of the
challenges to and opportunities for contemporary community.  The
significant issues facing institutions of higher education (e.g., the
canon, affirmative action, fragmentation of the student body, housing) are
all at base questions of community.
<br>
<br>

<li><b>"Community of Citizens"</b><br>
<br>
 In this phase, the group will also
address the relationship between communities and the larger "community of
citizenship."
Ways in which communities might act to create civic spaces for the
discussion of public issues and the re-engagement of  citizens in
political processes will be explored, developed, and promoted.
<br>

</ol>
<b>
Questions for Discussion</b>
<ol>
<li>Are there any corrections, additions, or deletions you would make to
this summary?
<br>
<br>

<li>What would be the best way for the group to increase its diversity ?
<br>
<br>

<li>Would it be useful, at this stage, for the group to commission
research?  If so, what should be the focus of this initial research?
<br>
<br>

<li>The group is scheduled to present its findings at the plenary meeting
to be held in Los Angeles in December 1998.  What sort of timetable should
the group set up for its work?
<br>
<br>

<li>Creating new communities through electronic communication will be one
of the focuses of this group's investigations.  As we work together to
form
our own community, largely via the listserv, are there ways you think
would
be useful in making this a more meaningful and successful experience?
