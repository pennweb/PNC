The Criminalization of Politics and its Impact on Culture<p>
Presentation by Mr. Paul Begala
</font>
</center>
<p>
CASS SUNSTEIN:  .... speaker is David Bromwich, who is the Hausen
professor of
English at Yale.  He was the director of the Whitney Humanities
Center at Yale.  He has written many books, very famously a book called
"Politics By Other Means:  Higher Education and Group Thinking," which has
received a lot of attention, and I know every one, except one of you, owns
it.
So that will be related to his presentation today.  He's also participated
in public life, writing for The New York Review of Books, the New Republic
and
The Times' Literary Supplement, among others.
<p>
Our first speaker is Paul Begala, who teaches at the University of Texas
at
Austin, who is the senior vice president of Public Strategies, who was the
senior strategist for President Clinton's first campaign, and who has been
the
senior adviser to many campaigns--I think almost all of them successful.
So those of you who have political ambitions, you've come to the right
place.  He's also on TV a great deal of the time.  I'm very pleased to
present
Paul Begala.
<p>
PAUL BEGALA:  The reason the losers are not on here is that Carville
and I had a phrase:  We don't lose campaigns, our clients do.  I'm sure
attorneys would never believe that.  That sounds like a political
consultant,
doesn't it?
<p>
I have to start stating the obvious because that's sort of been my
training, that the notion of someone like me addressing folks like you is
like
Captain Joseph Hazelwood of the Exxon Valdez coming to the Safe Boating
Society of Newport.  I mean, it's sort of related, but not exactly in
the way that you might hope.
<p>
I am just sort of struck by and reminded of a story that my former client
used to tell in these sorts of settings, when he felt maybe out of place,
the
story of the man from the Mississippi Delta region of Arkansas who was
drowned in a great flood.  And when he went to meet his maker, St. Peter,
at
the gate, said, `We have a tradition here that everyone who comes, should
he
or she choose to, can share something with the other souls who have met
their
reward, some lesson that they may have learned from their time on Earth.
And
is there anything you'd like to share?'
<p>
And he was a man of few words, a simple farmer caught up in a great flood.
Well, he thought about it for a minute, and he said, `Yes.  You know, it
was
actually at the moment of my demise that I was so struck--overwhelmed--by
the
mighty forces of nature and of man's insignificance against something
that mighty and powerful as this flood that washed me and my farm away.'
So
St. Peter looked down his list and said, `Floods, floods--yes, in fact, we
do
have a seminar on floods.  Move over to room 210, you'll be speaking right
after Mr. Noah.'
<p>
I'm sort of speaking before and after Mr. Noah, I think.  So given that
disclaimer and heartfelt humility at accepting Judy's invitation to serve
and to even address you, having never been accused of being social or
civil or
cultured, I understand that my selection actually was prompted by
the fact that both Beavis and Butthead were otherwise engaged today, so
someone else had to fill the role of exemplar of the incivility of
American
politics.  I'm just the guy to do it.
<p>
I'm reminded of what Gandhi said when he was asked once what he thought
about
Western civilization.  And he said, `I think it would be a good thing.'
So do
I think, perhaps, civility in American politics might be a good thing, but
it's something that actually I don't think we've tried very often.  That's
a
belief that I've come to, I think, rather late in the game, or more
precisely,
after largely having left the game, having retreated to the ivory towers
and
the friendly confines of my home of Austin, Texas.
<p>
But while I was running campaigns for a living--I don't want to claim any
moral superiority, here--I probably appeared on "Crossfire" as much or
more
than anybody.  I'm a regular on the "Imus in the Morning" show.  I was
grateful that Judy did not use any of my quotations and comments.  I mean,
I'm
the guy on the Imus show who once called Bob Dole the Metamucil Kid or
said
that Haley Barbour reminded me of Arnold Ziffel on "Green Acres"--the pig.
<p>
At one point I had gotten so out of hand in this sort of personal assault
that--some of you know this, it's absolutely true -- that the dean of
Washington political journalism, David Broder, was prompted to say in
print
that I was debasing the dialogue of democracy.  And in response, I called
him
a gas bag, so I sort of--sure proved him wrong, didn't I?  I'll tell you,
he
learned his lesson.  Broder don't mess with me no more.
<p>
So I do think, again, given the double reasons for my humility that it is
laudable to shine a light on these types of questions, while also
keeping in mind, as Tom Fiedler, the political writer for the Miami
Herald,
pointed out in a column on this topic, that the very word `campaign,' of
course, comes from war.  And sometimes the ethics, if not the tactics of
warfare, are related in our political campaigns.  And, in fact, the very
word
`civility' is derived from the absence of war.
<p>
And Friedman goes so far as to--Fiedler, rather, goes so far as to suggest
that maybe we should keep them separate and that maybe civility is
something
to happen only in the post-campaign era, that in the particular life that
I lived in, the clash of the campaign itself, that civility would,
perhaps, be
a bad thing.  He was prompted to write this after the enormously civil set
of
presidential and vice presidential debates that we had in the 1996
election
cycle.  Although I'm out of that business, I did get to come and hang out
and
do a little bit of debate prep.  And so I was keenly interested in the
post-debate coverage, and was surprised that so much of the punditry
was critical of the civility.  It went so far that a Tampa
talk-radio host said, and I quote, "These people who talk about civility,
they
should all be shot in the head."
<p>
So even when the politicians and their handlers are trying, for sound
reasons, I think they hope to be rewarded by voters, not for any
particularly
noble cause--trying to move toward a more civil dialogue, there will
always be
those trying to drag them back.  And, again, certainly disclaiming
any true scholarship, it didn't take long for me to pull out some classic
examples from our history, though, that suggest that our campaigns have
generally been more war than civil in our history.
<p>
I'll give you a few examples:  Benjamin Franklin Bache, the grandson of
the
sage of Philadelphia, once said this:  "If ever a nation has been
debauched by
a man, the American nation has been debauched by Washington."  And this
about the only president to be unanimously elected by the Electoral
College.
Lincoln was, of course, much worse treated.  He was labeled a filthy
storyteller in the 1864 campaign; he was called Ignoramus Abe, a despot,
liar,
braggart, buffoon, usurper, monster, scoundrel, perjurer, robber,
swindler,
tyrant, fiend and butcher.  And that from the folks who were not at war
with
him.  That was from his side of the line.
<p>
I was particularly interested in Robert Wiebe's comment about historical
mugwumpism, in relating this quotation about Lincoln from the New York
World,
who said, "The age of rail-splitters and tailors, of buffoons and bores
and
fanatics has succeeded, and the age of statesmen is gone.  In a crisis of
the
most appalling magnitude, requiring statesmanship of the highest order,
the
country is asked to consider the claims of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew
Johnson,
two ignorant, boorish, backwoods lawyers, for the highest stations of the
government.  God save the republic."
<p>
And so for much of our history--I mean, you could talk about Andrew
Jackson,
who was accused of murdering his own troops, six troops he shot for
desertion
in the Creek War of 1813.  It was later brought up as an example of his
blood lust.  He was reported to have wept, Old Hickory, when he read the
accounts in the paper claiming that his mother had been a prostitute.  And
the
stories of his wife's first marriage--apparently not properly terminated
before she married Jackson -- he believed, drove her to her death, just
before
the election.  And at her funeral, he said, `May God Almighty forgive her
murderers, as I know she forgave them.  I never can.'
<p>
And one final example I'll give you, in the milieu that I operated [in],
is on 
Thomas Jefferson.  The filmmaker, Paul Steckler, produced this
attack ad on Thomas Jefferson in his film, "Vote For Me," and the text of
this
ad is drawn entirely from contemporaneous political attacks on Thomas
Jefferson.  Michael.
<p>
(Excerpt from "Vote For Me")
<p>
Narrator :  A nation destroyed, dwellings in flames, gray hairs
bathed in blood, female chastity violated, children writhing on the pike
and
halberd.  It happened in France, but it could happen right here in America
if
Thomas Jefferson is elected president.  Murder, robbery, rape and incest
will
be openly taught and practiced, the soil will be soaked in blood and the
nation black with crimes.  Great God of compassion and justice, shield our
country from destruction.  Vote Federalist.

<p>
BEGALA:  So even a non-historian, I think, could quite easily pull
examples of American politics being scandalous and slanderous, and yet we
all
know in our bones--and I certainly have seen firsthand and participated
firsthand in a politics today that, if not dirtier than anytime in our
history, certainly more uncivil than it ought to be.  I do think that if
you look at this footage, or if you read the history, it is hard to
sustain
the argument that the president believes, that he is the most vilified
president in our history, but I think that's wrong.  But I think
other things obtain.  So let me identify, as a practitioner of the black
art, three things that are different today, one historical, one
technological and one, for lack of a better term, attitudinal.
<p>
The historical point is, again, from a strategist's point of view, I think
it's been very important to our politics and to the political posturing of
our
candidates, particularly a president, that the Cold War ended, perhaps
before
we were ready for it to end.  Now there is a lot to be said for the
denuclearization of Ukraine, the third-largest nuclear power.  I think
it's
terrific that there are no nuclear weapons pointed at our children for the
first time in the atomic era.  But for a political consultant who is
trying to
work on the image of a president, I have to tell you, there were times
when I
longed for the heroic glow of the long twilight struggle that Atomic Age
presidents were cast in.  I mean, you know, next to handling the risks of
thermonuclear destruction, a Mexican trade deal just don't cut it.
<p>
But that's the world that we have today.  It's so much the better, except
for
those of us who are trying to lionize and deify our presidents.  So
absent this need to deify political leaders, which I'm sure made it a lot
easier to sleep at night in that day, our political culture, I think, has
been more free to return to, perhaps, pre-Cold War standards, with this
difference:  As we saw in this spot, now we can combine 19th century
standards
of civility with 21st century means of mass-communication.  And this
technological revolution has been, I think, very, very important in what's
going on in our politics.  And it can enlighten, but it certainly can
also produce quite a toxic mix.
<p>
The slanders and slurs that I started this talk with were published in
newspapers, which, in their day, a small minority, I suspect, even of
voters--I don't really know--were really aware of.  Today, within [an]
instant, the
entire country, indeed, the entire world, can be and is bombarded with new
and
often negative information, sometimes true and sometimes not.  Talk radio,
cable TV, the Internet--an explosion, even just on cable, of CNN and
CNN-FM
and now Mr. Murdoch is going to have his own station.  None of these
things
even existed just a generation ago.
<p>
The speed of technology has abbreviated the amount of time that a
journalist
has to judge, to reason, to think, to evaluate.  And as this new cycle has
shortened, as the explosion of information has increased competition,
in a whole lot of cases we have seen broadcasting replace journalism.
That is, point a camera, beam it off a satellite, send it on--no filter,
no
analysis, no fact-checking, just the charge, ma'am.  And you know, `Don't
worry, Mr. President, we will give you equal time to respond to the charge
that your wife is carrying a space alien's baby, but we have to carry the
charge because we can.'
<p>
So in addition to this historical reality, the end of the Cold War, and in
addition to the technological revolution, I want to talk a little bit more
about a third factor that I think plays an important part in the decline
of
civility in our politics, and that is an attitude that has changed on the
part
of people who play the game.  And that is an attitude about what is and is
not
fair game in a campaign or in politics.
<p>
Believe me, I think there's nothing wrong with a negative campaign on the
issues, and, of course, we'll have big fights about what is and is not an
issue, and even that is fine.  I think voters are smart enough and the
system
is sturdy enough to sort through an awful lot of hyperbole.  I'm just not
too
worried about one party screaming that Clinton passed the largest tax
increase
in history or wants to socialize medicine, or my party screaming about
Newt
Gingrich and his crowd wanting to savage medicare and hurt senior
citizens.  I think voters can sort through that kind of hyperbole, and I
think
they do, in the main, a very good job.
<p>
But politics today doesn't end with a fight about policy disagreements.
It
only begins there.  In the '60s there was this saying about how the
personal
was political.  And in the '90s, practitioners are almost turning that
inside
out and saying every political difference is now a matter of deep personal
character.  This allows for very little nuance.  As Martin was talking
about,
it allows for very little common ground.
<p>
And so, in addition to arguing about political disagreements, we're now in
the business of, and the regular practice of attacking the very moral
fiber of
our opponents.  Think about the slogan of the Dole-Kemp 1996 campaign, a 
campaign that was, compared to most, very, very civil.  The slogan of
the campaign was, "A better man for a better America."  It was not better
policies or programs or ideas or issues, it was a better man.  And I know
I'm partisan--I certainly, as a partisan, got the sense from my Republican
friends that they had the belief that, `My guy's good and he's going to
heaven, and your guy's rotten and he's going to hell.'
<p>
And once you've moved from the political or the policy to the personal, it
is
a very quick jump to the criminal, to go from a Democratic perspective,
from saying, `Newt is wrong on Medicare,' to, `Newt is a no-good bum who
left
his wife in a cancer ward and didn't pay child support,' to, `Newt's a
crook,
get a rope.'
<p>
And so we have now, quite easily, moved full-tilt, I think, down the
slippery
slope, and I think that that is, in great measure, a change in the way of
doing business.  Yes, Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House and
acquitted by the Senate, only by a single vote; and yes, Richard Nixon
left
office one step ahead of the sheriff.  But in the main, I
believe there was a brighter line between political and even personal
attacks on the one, and criminal attacks on the other.  And as a partisan
Democrat, of course, I'd like nothing better than to try to convince you
that
it's all the fault of the Republicans.
<p>
The truth is I think my party probably bears more of the weight for the
criminalization of political differences than the other party,
although they seem to be having a little more fun of it of late.  I can
remember, as an aide to the House Majority Leader during the Bush
administration, Democrats in Congress coming into his office and begging
for
hearings on the October surprise.  Now you all may remember what this is,
but I
promise you my mama doesn't.
<p>
It was this notion that during the 1980 campaign, when he was running for
vice president, George Bush went to Paris and met with the Ayatollah
Khomeini,
and urged him to keep American hostages in captivity in Teheran longer
than he
otherwise might have, so as not to give Jimmy Carter an unfair advantage
in
the election.  And you'd sit there with these people and say, `OK, well,
you
know, there is no record that Bush flew to Paris during the campaign.'
And
like dealing with any conspiracy buff, of course, they said,
`Yeah, he used his CIA contacts to get on an SR-71 Blackbird, the fastest
plane in the world, supersonic plane, flying just--just barely within the
Earth's atmosphere.'  OK.  They're probably landing a lot of them at Orly
Airport these days.
<p>
And then you say, well, Bush, at that stage of the campaign, had Secret
Service protection, and believe me, these are independent people.  They're
career professionals.  They're not partisans.  And they log your every
move.
`Oh, he gave them the slip.  Don't forget, he's an old spook.'  Bush got
more
mileage out of, like, two years at the CIA than anybody I ever met.  So
then
you say, `OK, why was the ayatollah so eager to get Ronald Reagan and get
rid
of Jimmy Carter?'  `Ah, so that Oliver North could sell him weapons.'
<p>
At this point, you know, they wanted to have hearings.  And you know,
maybe they're right, who knows, but I think
it's patent nonsense.  And I think this is what was driving it instead:
a political reality said to them, `George Bush is at 91 percent at the end
of
the Gulf War.  We have lost five out of the last six elections.'  This is
in
1990--'91, that these hearings were--I don't even remember if they were
held,
because I wound up quitting the Hill.  We lost five out of the last six
elections and the only one of those six that my part won was in the wake
of
the Watergate scandal.  So A, we're probably not going to win the White
House;
B, we probably can't win it on the battlefield of ideas.  So, C,
conclusion, rather,
 let's go find us another Watergate scandal.  That's how we can get into
the White House.'
<p>
Now I've run national campaigns in Europe and in South America, as well as
the US, and I can remember feeling this sort of smug superiority when my
overseas clients would say things with not just a touch of irony saying,
you
know, `I really hope we win this, because if we lose, the opposition's
going
to put us in jail.'  And the superiority that I felt, that smugness, has
sort
of melted away as I've realized that in America, we do the reverse.  We
let
the losers incarcerate the winners.
<p>
And it's of no real comfort if you happen to be a winner.  And it's
believed
that we will move to the grand jury room to resolve what we could not
win--or
the hearing room--what we could not win in the polling place, I think, can
have tragic consequences.  I'm sure everybody in this room remembers
Raymond Donovan, President Reagan's secretary of labor, wrongly accused of
ties to organized crime, indicted, tried, acquitted, who returned to
Washington with this question:
<p>
He said, `Where do I report to get my good name back?' Or the
final fragmentary notes that my friend, Vince Foster, left, who observed
that
in Washington, ruining lives and reputations is considered sport.
<p>
And there's others that you may not have heard of.  Janet Mullins, who's a
very able and honest aide to President Bush, who was caught up in the
scandal
machine, and even with a letter of apology from the independent counsel
who
investigated her, found it very difficult to find work, much less to pay
her
monstrous legal debts.  And now, of course, I'm personally concerned about
it because I have a lot of friends who have legal bills in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars, and they've never been accused of wrongdoing.  I
mean,
some of my friends have, but I have an awful lot who haven't.  And they're
sort of caught up in this like dolphins in a tuna drift net, with no real
recourse.
<p>
And I think that the ease with which this supposedly neutral prosecutorial
apparatus can be manipulated should give us all pause.  And it gives an
encouragement to political practitioners to move very quickly from policy
to
brief stop at personal attack and right into criminalization.  Some of
this is
just human nature.  I am sure that those Democrats on the Hill that I used
to
work for feel a good deal of schadenfreude now as Newt Gingrich, who
hounded
Jim Wright out of office, now is, himself, the subject of 74 ethics
complaints.  And I imagine there are plenty of Republicans, who once
served in
the White House, who are now muttering payback as this machine plows
through
my friends.
<p>
Now I don't have any easy answers, and I don't even have any complex
answers
to all of this, because I certainly know there will always be crime in
government, and many political figures probably richly deserve
prosecution.
But this rush to criminalize so many political differences, I think, in
this
era should bother you, because it certainly alarms me.  Payback begets
payback.  You know, there are very few Nelson Mandelas out there who are
willing to come to power and say, `Well, let's just move beyond the sins
of
the past and build the hopes of the future.'  And if there were, I think
the
first thing I would say is, `Nelson, welcome to Washington.  If you want
to be
in the press, get a thick skin, but if you want to be in politics, get a
good
lawyer, because that's the state of political discourse here at the end of
the
21st century.'
<p>
These historical, technological and attitudinal forces have combined in a
way that might not have been predicted, I think, to make what we have
for politics today very different from what it has been in the past.
Thank
you very much.
