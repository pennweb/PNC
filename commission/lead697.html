RE: Request for discussion on the first meeting of the working group
(6/12/97)

The following is a brief summary of the first meeting of the Working Group
on Leadership. It is being sent to you via the working group's listserv to
further discussion among members of the group's orientation and initial
tasks. Michael Schudson will be adding to this summary after July 4. To
respond to all members of the Working Group on Leadership, just use the
"reply" feature on your e-mail system.

PNC Working Group on Leadership
Chair: Michael Schudson

The first meeting of the PNC Working Group on Leadership was held on June
12. The group quickly developed a working charge and identified desirable
outcomes, recommended resources, and suggested readings on leadership.

Charge 

The group identified a working charge: "To identify skills and
foster civic imagination that will feed into a well-functioning system of
democratic deliberation in which good leadership can flourish in a rapidly
changing global society." 

Discussion

The group identified several problems (not the least of which was the
seeming lack of literature on leadership) and made suggestions for
substantively discussing leadership. The following questions arose: How
will the group define leadership and its parameters? On what types of
leaders will the group focus? (The group leaned toward political leaders.) 
What about those who are led, "the followership"? Should we consider how
to encourage "emerging" leaders? 

Members of the group suggested identifying leaders and leadership
qualities that "transcend" narrow, personal interests (e.g. Mandela).
Members also suggested considering leadership in context (e.g. Truman,
JFK, Johnson during challenging periods in their presidencies), and
identifying what is different about leadership today in a historical
context. 

Members also recommended considering the "disconnect" between the
"followership" and leaders.

Recommendations

For the short term, the group decided to hone the working charge of the
group, then discuss process and outcomes, all via e-mail. Also, the group
advocated the development of a good reading list.

In the long term, the group would like to produce "creative outcomes," not
a report. The group expressed a desire to identify good speakers and to
develop a James Madison Award for exemplary leadership.

A possible product, which the group discussed at length, would be
"Profiles in Leadership" (i.e. biographies of "exemplars" of leadership)
which could be developed in several ways: 

        * The group studies existing profiles and then determines the
characteristics of leadership and how leaders handled challenging
situations. 

        * The group commissions profiles/case studies of current
leaders and compiles them, possibly into a book.

        * The group writes or commissions substantive,
journalistic-style articles (as inThe New Yorker andThe New York Times) on
real and "imagined" leaders and their work. The imagined leaders would be
composites of the strengths of admirable leaders.

Suggested resources

This list is by no means complete. It is a compilation of the resources
mentioned during the first meeting. Additions and further explanations of
the information below are, of course, welcome.

*       Leadership schools around the country
*       Case-study project at the Kennedy School
*       Business Executive Trust (BET)
*       Ernie Cortez (teaches leadership in low-income areas)
*       Richard Harwood (assembles different racial and ethnic groups for
	deliberative dialogue)
*       Gerald(?) Taylor

Suggested readings

The readings below were mentioned during the working group meeting. Since
the group expressed much interest in exploring readings on leaders and
leadership, the expansion of this list seems to merit significant
attention.

The Art of the Impossible  by Vaclav Havel

A biography of Ernie Cortes was mentioned. Two possibilities arose in a
library search: Mexican-Americans --The Ambivalent Minority  by Peter
Skerry (1993) and Cold Anger -- A Story of Faith and Power Politics  by
Mary Beth Rogers (c. 1990).

Immediate questions for continued discussion via listserv:

1. Does the group need to add to or subtract from the working charge?

2.  How should the group go about the task of defining the scope of
leadership it wishes to consider?

3. Do the group's recommendations offer useful ways in which to proceed?

4. Are there additions to the lists of suggested resources and readings
compiled during the first meeting?

5.  Are there other tasks the group or the Commission staff should
undertake at this stage to further the group's work?

From: "Martin E. P. Seligman" <seligman@CATTELL.PSYCH.UPENN.EDU> 
Subject:  Re: Request for discussion on the first meeting of the working
group

        I would like to suggest an additional domain for the leadership
group: Children and Leadership--the Next Generation.

        The theme of my concern is how can the next generation of leaders
be cultivated. The focus is grade school, middle school,
and high school. Among the questions I believe that need answers:

1) What models of leadership are taught? In the schools (civics)?
By the media? By parents?

2) Do our children admire our leaders? Do they want to become
leaders? How has this trend changed over the last forty years?
(I expect the answers to these will be grim.)

3) How should leadership be taught in the schools and by the media?

4) How can future leaders be identified early and nurtured.

        I would like to see us commission research on these topics.

        Marty Seligman
