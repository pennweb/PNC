<p>
JUDITH RODIN:  OK.  This is the working part of the working lunch, so
while you are finishing your lunch what I'd like to do is call on the
chairs
of each of the working groups to report very briefly to the broader group
about what the working groups hope to accomplish, where they're going,
highlights of the conversation.  I would ask each working group chair to
literally take five minutes at the most, so that we can then expand the
conversation and--and--and talk about the working groups as they intersect
with one another and then review where we've come through the two days of
meetings. <p>

And I'll start with some preferatory remarks and then ask each of you, if
you
would like, as we go around the table, to make some comments and--about
your
conclusions from the two days of--of very interesting presentations and
conversation that we've had.
<p>
So, Steve, will you start for the culture and behavior working group--the
likely chair of this group couldn't make the session and so we've asked
Steve
to report to you. <p>

STEPHEN STEINBERG:  Thank you.  I will just run through about six bullets
very quickly. To summarize, this is the culture and behavior group--or was
the culture and behavior group.  As you'll see, we're--we're working
towards some change in that--in that titling. <p>

I think we re--actually start from the presupposition that we are living
in a
time of profound change and great dissatisfaction with public life and the
character of interaction in the public sphere.  But there are...
<p>
[tape change]
<p>
...of putting those alternative normative conceptions together.  We, I
believe, agree to start by defining what we regard as the normative
standards
of public interaction of all kinds and to focus on a number of areas in
which
we think those can be usefully redefined as well as exploring the--the
origins
of the current dissatisfaction. <p>

Some of those might be--and this is not yet a determinative list--the
privacy
public distinction; the issues of tolerance and fundamentalism, and issues
around the inclusion of groups; issues of isolation and the lack of
engagement across differences; equity fairness distinctions, including
issues
of rights and--and the absolutism that is associated with many claims to
rights; and perhaps some discussion of the issues of adversarial culture
and
dispute resolution as they regard the larger culture, not as a
professional
issue in--in some professions.
<p>
The--this, then, allows us to start from the work of public interaction
and
defining the norms of public interaction, and then engage other issues as
needed, and as they grow out of that conversation.  And that has led us,
really, towards a change in the name of the group towards something like
culture and public behavior, public life--really, to emphasize that we
want to
focus on the public sphere and interactions in the public sphere, not on
what
goes on at home and in the bedroom and places of that sort.
<p>
So that is essentially where we are.  We will begin by working on the task
of
redefining--or defining those normative areas and beginning to articulate
what
we regard as useful norms in those areas.
<p>
Is that...
<p>
RODIN:  Anyone from the working group that would like to fill in or
amplify
in a sentence or two?  I'm happy for you to do that if you think it
would--OK,
great.  Thank you.  Michael, will you...
<p>
MICHAEL SCHUDSON:  It sounds like parallel processes were--were going on
here, because
I--we didn't change the definition in the leadership in a democratic
society
group--we didn't change the title, but--but the emphasis shifted a bit as
we
talked.  And so the--couple of--of assumptions I--I think emerged early
on,
that we weren't assuming that we were talking about a failure of
leadership
today; that we do assume that the leadership we're interested in is one
especially fitted to a democratic society; that the kind of leadership
we're
interested in talking about is one especially fitted to a diverse society.
<p>
We didn't really discuss, though I think it was in the margins, whether it
might be one especially fitted to an American society.  And it's certainly
one--the one we're trying to understand and define and promote is one
fitted
to a--a rapidly changing society. <p>

So we--we arrived at a statement--group members will pardon me--that went
roughly like this:  That we're interested in defining and--and fostering a
kind of leadership that enhances skills and capacities and civic
imagination.
That--that was the term that became quite central in our discussion, civic
imagination.  And that the kind of leadership we're--it's a normative
concept
of--of leadership we're looking at is one that transcends narrow interests
and
contributes to a well-functioning system of democratic deliberation,
s--implicit in that, a system committed to political equality, to liberty
and
to justice.
<p>
This leadership encourages a process in which leadership flourishes and
encourages leadership at all levels, and a leadership that will be able to
function in a rapidly changing global, technological society.  The concept
of
leadership we want to explore is one that will address the relations of
leaders to the people alienated from public life and distrustful of
leadership
and leaders, that this democratic leadership would--is one that seeks to
advance inclusiveness and participation in society.
<p>
Now w--what the next step is, having arrived at a definition of our--our
charge, something like that is--is a little less clear, but several ideas
came
out.  We are interested in case studies of leadership, biographies of
contemporary leaders.  Someone talked about a--producing or
commissioning--that would be better--profiles in contemporary courage,
leadership that does what--what we're--we're looking at, transcending
particular institutional leadership boundaries and finding a civic
imagination
or a--illuminating that, imagining the situations in which--or improvising
situations are--that are opportunities for leadership, occasions in which
we
would like to see leadership exercised.
<p>
Jay Rosen suggested imagining The New York Times news story that would
cover those occasions, and we might actually write up such--such things.
<p>
So that--that's--that's about where we ended up, I think, at 12:00.
<p>
RODIN:  Thank you.  Others in that working group who would want to comment
or amplify?  OK, J...
<p>
Unidentified Man #2:  I just want to say, he did a brilliant job of
capturing
what we talked about.
<p>
RODIN:  Joyce?
<p>
JOYCE APPLEBY:  Well, as you can well imagine, if you put 11 people in a
room, 10 of
whom are Americans, and ask them to talk about community, it's going to be
a
very wide-ranging discussion.  And the one foreign member of our task
force
also kept us on--aware that we had a lot of commonalities that we were
taking
for granted, that ought to be a part of our definition or concern with
community.
<p>
In the middle of this wide-ranging discussion, someone said, `You know, I
think we're getting back to that issue of civility that we started with in
December.' And it was kind of interesting, I thought, the way this turned
around.  And the notion was that--after we discussed it--that--that there
had
been homogeneity of--of national culture in America, however oppressively
enforced, and that multiculturalism had erupted in the middle of that and
confronted us all with heterogeneity in a very noisy, contentious,
uncompromising kin--series of discussions, and that that had probably
produced
the--the sense of incivility that had inspired this commission.
<p>
And that--that discussion around homogeneity and heterogeneity, which of
course was at the heart of what we heard this morning, and listening to
Richard Rodriguez, I was reminded of how politicized that discussion
became,
and I just want to throw this out, that in the--in the middle of the
national
histories standards debate and the national histories standards debate was
also a debate about homogeneity and heterogeneity--the United States
Senate
passed a resolution for the day, which read that any agency or center or
program or department that gets money from the United States Congress must
have a due regard for the roots in Western civilization of the United
States,
which is kind of a breathtaking politicization of this issue.
<p>
So I think that this had a lot to do with the way in which we approached
community--that is, be aware of the--the mythic proportions of community
and
wanting--wanting to find out specifically about communities that are
existing
in the United States.  So when we--after we had roamed widely over these
issues and--and the nature of community, and where in--it did and didn't
exist, we decided that what we wanted to find out about communities, we
wanted
to explore, do--do some--some investigating work about the communities
that
exist in the country now, and in the broadest sense of--of communities
that
are communities of affinity or religious communities or communities in our
neighborhoods, communities that are voluntary and involuntary communities.
<p>
And our goal would be to not only to discovery whether or not they're
successful or unsuccessful, but also to examine whether they strengthen or
weaken the--the community of citizens.  And--so that our interest in
communities was going to be tied back to our interest in public life and
the
discussion of--and de--discussions and deliberations about some common
issues.
<p>
So we were going to do the exploration first and then we felt that
with--on
the basis of that exploration, we would be better able to answer the
questions
that had arisen about defining community, defining American commonalities
and--and de--determining such things as the interaction between culture
and
community, and that after we had done that, that then we would perhaps be
in a
position to make some recommendations.  In fact, one of the areas that we
pointed--that was brought to the--out where we might make recommendations
was
in this very new community, the--the community that exists in in
cyberspace.
<p>
We ended by asking what each of us did, in our--our work that we're now
engaged in, that might contribute to this enterprise and then what ta--we
asked what tasks would people take on for this effort of exploring,
defining
and answering and then recommending.  And we also contributed some ideas
about
who we would like to bring into our task force, and I think one of the
things
that we were aware of, getting back to this issue of homogeneity and
heterogeneity, is that perhaps our task force itself needed to have some
additions if we really were going to confront the ot--the components in
the
country that make up the various communities that we're going to study.
<p>
So I'd be very happy to answer any questions that--that any of you have
about
our work or perhaps somebody else from the...
<p>
RODIN:  Right, or other...
<p>
APPLEBY:  ...from the...
<p>
RODIN:  ...members of the working group, if there's any.  OK, then why
don't I open it for broader discussion, comments about the convergences,
the--the appropriate overlaps or--or directions of any of these groups or
additions that you would like the groups to take, given what you heard.
Jim.
<p>
JAMES FISHKIN:  I think it's very striking that three groups that had
carefully
differentiated topics produced an area of clear overlap.  In fact, I think
the--Joyce's account of our deliberations w--which--for the group she
recruited me to join, where--was--was accurate, but it didn't fully
emphasize
the--the--the area of overlap, which is, if I heard in all three, a kind
of
concern for the public space, the community of citizens, atrophying
citizenship--what are the conditions under which we can deliberate about
issues together, where the country can deliberate about issues together,
where
s--the normative conditions of sort of mutual respect, civility--these
are--these all connect very nicely.  And I just wanted to com--note that
the--I was quite surprised, because I thought we'd get three different
reports
and there's a--to some degree, we got the same bottom line on the three
reports, if I heard accurately.
<p>
Unidentified Woman #2:  Converging.
<p>
RODIN:  Do you think that's good or a problem?
<p>
FISHKIN:  I think it's great, in terms of the commission moving forward,
because
there's a lot of--from very different perspectives we have some clearly
shared interests and we're beginning to--we're beginning to function as a
deliberating community ourselves.     And maybe with cyberspace and with
further meetings that will clarify further.  And--and it's also
interesting
that the combination of this normative--normative criteria and empirical
outreach and empirical interests and the dialogue that will go back and
forth
between the two is--seems to be a part of the common agenda of how we
should
function.
<p>
Unidentified Woman #3:  It just--it just occurs to me that our--that the
other
two groups set for themselves an empirical task of looking at leadership,
looking at test cases or--What was it?--cases.  And the other one set for
themselves a task of looking at community, right?  And the way we framed
ours
was kind of a normative task.  So I'm just--I don't know if it's good or
bad,
I'm just throwing this out as a point to think about, whether we would
like to
think of an empirical task or whether it's a good thing that there will be
this division.  I'm just pointing this out from what I heard.
<p>
RODIN:  We're--we'll want to come back to that.  I--I don't think that
there's a particularly right or more appropriate way.  And it may be that
characterizing the behaviors is no longer interesting in some ways because
we've had a lot of conversation about that, but understanding the
normative
underpinnings.  So...
<p>
Woman #3:  It would be a good idea...
<p>
RODIN:  Yeah.
<p>
Woman #3:  ..that it should--that there should be such a difference.
<p>
RODIN:  Hmm.  Amy.
<p>
AMY GUTMANN:  Our group really has set itself a normative task, but we
think of
gathering empirical information as part of fulfilling that task.  The task
is--the normative task--is to characterize leadership that would be
conducive
to civic imaginat--cr...
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
GUTMANN:  ...you know, the cultivation of civic imagination and skills in
a more
deliberative democracy, so that's a normative task.  But we don't want to
float up there and have some model that has no exemplars of it, so we want
to
see both what examples we can gather from literature, the biographies of
leaders and so on--gather those examples--have people help us gather
them--and
then also the imaginative task of writing something like New York Times
articles of what we--what we could see leaders today doing.
<p>
In other words, were there a will, some--we would imagine the will to be
democratic leaders--that there would be a way, not very abstractly, but
very
concretely.  And so one example that--two examples that were thrown out
were
Ernie Cortez, and Jim Freedman's leadership at Dartmouth shortly after he
was
president, in talking about the Dartmouth--the way the Dartmouth Review
had a
right to free speech, but it was poisoning the atmosphere on campus for
women
and--and minorities.  Those are the kinds of examples we'd want to give,
but
we'd want to then imagine, beyond them, to--it's a normative and empirical
task.  That's a--I--I wouldn't say that we sh--would want--we would be
against
choosing one--making a sharp divide here.
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
I--I will just say a word or two.  I think that there is tremendous
opportunity, as I said earlier, for these working groups to make a great
deal
of progress.  The commission staff stands ready to assist the working
groups
in whatever way they can be helpful, and we need to know from you where
resources are necessary, of a variety of kinds, as--as we do it.  Clearly
the
Web site--the electronic linkages are one mechanism.  There may be a need
to
get together in between meetings, not only through cyberspace, but also
face
to face or through video conferencing.  And surely that's possible as
well.
<p>
These will continue--the working groups clearly will continue to evolve
and
define themselves, and the domain may change again and again as the groups
continue to move.  And I--I see that clearly as an iterative process
that's--that will be very beneficial, because not only will the working
groups
gain from one anothers deliberations, but they'll continue to grow and
expand
and change from the biannual meetings that we have and the other
activities
that the commission may be sponsoring.
<p>
Joyce.
<p>
APPLEBY:  I was just curious if--if this means that we're no longer
interested
in campaign reform?
<p>
Unidentified Man #2:  Yeah.  No, I--I think we have to be interested in
campaign reform...
<p>
RODIN:  Oh, yeah.
<p>
Man #2:  ...if we're interested in our public dialogue.
<p>
RODIN:  That's true, too.
<p>
Man #2:  And that's got to be part of the--that's got to be part of the
agenda.
<p>
APPLEBY:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
Man #2:  And...
<p>
APPLEBY:  But it's disappeared in ours--in ours.
<p>
Unidentified Man #3:  It never came up in our--we were the ones who were
supposed to do that, right?
<p>
RODIN:  Right.  Campaign reform was not so much the topic in--which we
were
interested in; it was the failure to grapple with campaign reform as an
instance of the weakness of leadership.  I don't--I--from my mind, at
least, I
don't think we ever put campaign reform as a topic on the table that would
be
our commission's agenda.
<p>
GUTMANN:  Right.  I mean, we could imagine a New York Times article where
somebody
exercised leadership in this area, but we are not going to--we--our
leadership
group does not want to focus on that or any other particular issue.  I
think
it would be a mistake.  We're not experts in a particular issue.  We're
brought together because of our mutual concern for the issue of civic
leadership. <p>

RODIN:  I--I'd like to put up an...
<p>
UnideUnidentified Man #4:  Now the wa...
<p>
RODIN:  ...exclamation point on that, that rather than pick a particular
hot-button issue or topic like that, where we don't have--although we
could
bring in--the expertise, that--that our greatest talent is really in the
integration of--of the--the knowledge base on leadership and communities
and
civic behavior, and that we should focus on those.
<p>
Man #4:  What--what struck me, from Paul Taylor's, comments and fit the
way we
were talking about leadership was--was the example of the network
ex--executives having this opportunity to look beyond the interest of
their
network, to some larger civic obligation, and they blew it.  And--and it's
the--it's a ho--how--how do we model or picture or describe or a--address,
conceive a form of leadership that would do otherwise, that would
transcend
that?
<p>
RODIN:  Let me, before we--oh, go ahead--quick--quick comments, though,
because we're going to go around the table and give everybody a chance in
a
more gen--general way.
<p>
Unidentified Man #5:  Oh, I can wait for that.
<p>
RODIN:  OK.
<p>
SCHUDSON:  Well, I--I just--I guess I want to make one comment, because
I'm not
going to be here la--later on, and that is it--it--it does seem to me that
we've left out the question of substantive issues and that th--and
that--that--that we ought to entertain the possibility that a lot of the
problems ha--in American society today, and--and the strains on leadership
and
the strains on community come out of the substantive--the particular
substantive issues that have surfaced in American politics in the way
in--in
the way they--they--they have, and that it--it is race and im--the way in
which race has s--come to the fore, and immigration and the intermixture
of
public and private life that are opposing issues that are particularly
difficult to deal--deal with.
<p>
And I--I'm a little concerned, although in some sense I sh--I also share
the--the--the view that a lot of what's--the problem has to do with the
construction of society and a lack of leadership and--and--and--and so on.
But I wonder if all those problem--all those--those--those procedural or
structural issues would be the same if we were dealing with a different
set of
political problems. <p>

Unidentified Man #6:  Michael, what is substantive?  Are you--is that a
code
word for economic difference or--I'm just not sure why it is that the
things
that--that have been reported aren't, themselves, substantive?
<p>
SCHUDSON:  Well, for example--I mean, I--that is, is--is it a problem with
a
leadership or is it a problem that it's particularly difficult to be a
leader
on the--on the issue of race today or on immigration today or on
the--on--on
the kinds of--of power issues that have emerged and been inter--inter--and
intermixed about the issue of adultery in the--in--in--in--in the
military.
I--or I mean adultery at any--anywhere, and that that has been brought to
the
fore by, say, the way in which feminism sa--sexual orientation and so on
have
become political--political issues.  And--and I--I think one could
argue--and
I guess I--part of me wants to argue that--that it--it--it isn't,
that--that--that it just--it isn't a lack of civility, per se, in any
absolute
sense; it's that the particular things which the society is forced to
confront
today, for better or for worse, are issues that make it very difficult
to--to
sustain, for want of a better term, a civic--a civic politics or a
civic--civic relations in--in the political sphere.
<p>
Man #6:  Well, I encourage...
<p>
RODIN:  Michael, the point...
<p>
Man #6:  ...you to come to our working group because that is, I think, the
way
in which I think we saw our payoff.
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
Man #5:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
Man #6:  We would get to that as the climax, really, of our work--those
ways
of addressing quite real-life issues that reflect immediate American
problems
out of that sequence that begins with normative discussion and so forth.
But
it may be that the sequence bothers you, but I think that the
substance--at
least, if I can speak for our group--the substance was what we--where we
wanted to end up.  We want to end up dealing with kinds of issues like the
ones you're addressing.
<p>
RODIN:  And what makes them so difficult, so it would not be free of the
issues, but the construction would be not looking for solutions to the
issues,
but understanding why they are s--appear to be or feel to be such
intractable
problems. <p>

SCHUDSON:  OK.  Well, I mean, I don't want to over--I mean, I--I just
think
that--that at least in the sa--that there's a--I think--there's a danger
in
sa--in stating--in the problem that we start from a separation of
procedure
from--from--from...
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm. <p>

SCHUDSON:  ...substance, and I guess I think that the procedure and the
substance are inter--are inter--intertwined in a way in--in a really
fundamental--a fundamental way. <p>

Unidentified Man #7:  Can I speak to that?  I think we ought to assume, in
our
work, that there is more wisdom at rest than at work in the country, and
that
our job is to bring some of it, somehow, to light.  That's why I feel the
wo--term civic imagination is so important.  What I--what I think this
commission can do best is not issue policy recommendations or solve
problems
or say, `This is the answer to campaign finance reform,' or anything like
that, but picture for the country other ways of talking about framing,
addressing and styles of approach to democratic discourse that cut against
the--the kind of culture that we see and--and are--some degree regret.
<p>
So I--if we keep our focus on producing imaginative efforts, they would
resolve this tension between process and issue, and the very form of--of
what
we do.  So I--I think we really need to keep in mind, as a way of sparking
our
own imaginations, a very broad range of possible products that would be
the
result of our work.  And if you think in terms of products, rather than
process, you can see that this tension that I--that Michael is talking
about
could easily be resolved.  So the--the one example was already mentioned,
you
know, possible New York Times articles we would imagine seeing, that are
entirely plausible but actually represent a leap in leadership, is--is one
example. <p>

As I said before, I think we should make a two-minute talking-head
presentation by a candidate, talking in a way that we don't ordinarily
hear.
I think it would exciting for the commission to produce such a thing.  I
think
we--we could think of--of creating maps, con--of a better
conversation--conversational maps that improve upon the way we talk about
issues now, like the one Chris provided for us in his head when he
elaborated
the affirmative action debate.  We could think about producing tool boxes
for
people, that represent handles on--on problems that they don't have now.
We
could think about exercises or community activities, things people could
do in
their lives, that if they did them, would engage them in a kind of
deliberation that we see too little of.  That's a product.
<p>
We could think of character profiles, meaning imagined Americans--ideal
types
who we'd love to see dot the landscape--and write--write them up in a
dramatic
way using the skills of literature and the skills of theater, or new
institutions that don't exist, but ought to just--should.  Charters for
institutions that need to be invented, or vividly describe skills
that--that--that we need to see out there at work in the public culture.
<p>
So if we--if we keep in mind novel kinds of products as--way in the
distance,
as possible outcomes, then I think that as we move toward those things,
very
gradually, over a period of years, we will resolve these--these kinds of
tensions between process issues and substantive issues.  So I--I really
want
to stress that that--that we ought to come out with stuff that is entirely
creative in its form as well as whatever message we might want to send.
<p>
RODIN:  I think that's...
<p>
Unidentified Woman #4:  Hear!  Hear!
<p>

<a name="remarks">
RODIN:</a>  That's right.  I--I was asked to just take five minutes to try
to
extract and summarize a bit of the last two days.  I'd like to do
that--not to
kill conversation, but to continue to--to enhance it.  And I--I--forgive
my
boldness in doing this, because it was a tremendous amount of
conversation,
but what I'm trying to do, Jay, is actually following from what you said,
and
that is extract some of the more directive outcomes, if you will, from the
conversation.
<p>
Certainly we don't have to accept Kevin Phillips' economic determinism in
order to appreciate at least his observation that the system of market and
governmental interaction does seem to have lost its self-corrective
character.
What remains unclear and--and he couldn't say, is whether this is a
permanent
or merely temporary change.  But I think the implications for our work is
that
we may need to think about--and, again, envisioning models in which
a--other
institutions in society, besides government, creative substitute
correctives.
And that was a theme that ran through a lot of our discussions yesterday.
<p>
In that vein, several of you called upon us to demonstrate for the public
and
for leaders a utopian or norm--normative conversation, both demonstrate
that
it is possible and demonstrate what its potential is.  Certainly to do so
we
would need to expose how market forces drive political discourse, how
market
forces may atrophy citizenship, but we would need to go from there, I
think,
to inventing non-distorting incentives that would work against those
forces,
if we agree with Phillips that government is a distorting
incentive--government action--and would work against those forces at a--at
the
level of day-to-day concerns as well as on a societal level.
<p>
As we talked about the hot-button issues, there were several common
themes.
Let--let me review some of the different themes in each and then draw some
commonalities.  Certainly, in listening to Chris Edley, the issue of how
best
to affect change was at the forefront of our discussion.  Chris argued the
change won't occur without offering people a better model or a better
vision,
again, building on--on Jay's comment a vision of how we can do better at
the
business of moving forward together with some sense of affinity or
commonality.
<p>
If we take on this challenge, at the heart of this process, I think, has
to be
real concrete policy choices or communal tasks, out of which local
communities
or, indeed, we, as a national community, create a sense of commonality
through
which fundamental attitudes, values, beliefs that determine behavior could
be
transformed.
<p>
We heard Chris saying in--in somewhat different language, but comparable
to
the language we've used, that there needs to be a kind of robust, diverse,
engaged conversation in which differences in world view and attitude and
background and belief are explored, but that the conversation is not the
end
point; it is the beginning, the--the enabler for the rest of the activity
to
occur.
<p>
He offered a prescription to President Clinton, but it outlined a task for
all
leaders.  And I'd like the leadership group to at least go back and think
about the recommendations that Chris made for the president with regard to
what leaders can do.
<p>
I think extrapolating, as we did for the work of the commission, and
changing
the language a little, the points are worth reiterating:  First,
relentless
te--teaching about the issue at hand in an authoratitive voice, something
we
are competent to do and might want to undertake; relentless teaching about
what has gone wrong in our public discourse; a clearer articulation of a
vision that stands in contrast to alternatives; casting a spotlight on
significant examples of a local initiative or leadership that works and
why--and we've heard that that will be a task we're taking up; recruiting,
sustaining and nourishing leaders, and giving them the tools to become
effective miss--missionaries or a road map in that tool box, at least, in
all
of this, maintaining the focus on concrete day-to-day issues and--and this
does go back to Michael's point that we need to address the issues that
engage
people and--and influence their behavior.
<p>
People want to make a difference, the presumption was, but they need to
know
what they can do.  And as Bob Weevy said, it's important for us to
distinguish, in our own conversations, a loftier--appropriately lofty
ambition
to understand what the Great Society would look like in the long run from
an
equally important need to create more immediate day-to-day ways of doing
better together, because the two certainly inform one another.
<p>
To implement a program of proactive change, constructive change, requires
that
we tackle the failure of leadership.  Paul Taylor believes that many of
our
leaders are good people, and I think there's some question about that in
our--in our populace.  But he believes that they are good people and would
wish to do better if they knew how, that given the tools and the model,
they
could do so.
<p>
As we discussed during Paul's presentation, the failure of leadership
stems,
at least in part, from confusing public and private spheres, and that is
something that our working groups will get into.  But this may be, in
part,
leading to the very excessive intimacy--our leaders under the spotlight of
television and public scrutiny--in part leading to a gl--decline in public
trust, both in our leaders and importantly, also, in our institutions.
<p>
The process has not only left our leaders exposed, so--out of
self-pre--preservation many of them have stopped leading, but they also
seem
to have left our fundamental and populace and institutions exposed, and
that
is one of the--the concerns that we have.  I thought Paul's comment about
the
public becoming cognoscenti of their own bamboozlement was especially
compelling.  But it does result in a kind of vicious cycle, in which
there's a
spiraling and increasing fearfulness of--of--of the populace and
increasingly
fearful leaders intersect--interacting with their disaffected
constituencies,
which has turned off the American public and has led us to put our worst
foot
forward. <p>

We, I think, in our conversation and our comments, believe that we can be
proactive, that we can develop maps that will allow our leaders to become
more
proactive by showing them how to do better, by demonstrating to the public
that they can and will do better and--and--and will be rewarded for doing
so
and--and lead to a ratcheting-up of that cycle in a more positive
direction.
<p>
But it requires showing the public examples of good public discourse and
focusing on tasks such as educating our children to become good citizens,
something I didn't hear in the working group conversation, but that
interested
many of us yesterday.  In this way, we can address what Cass called the
inert populace, which is true, and create a more robust marketplace of
ideas,
perhaps a more vibrant national town square, in which we have common
experiences, but also learn from a marketplace of--of different ideas.
<p>
I think that's the challenge that Richard Rodriguez addressed this morning
in
his poetic description of what he called a profoundly unsettling moment in
the
American experience.  He described eloquently the aggressiveness and the
impact of the shifts in culture de--identify that we're going through and
he
underscored, wh--for me, at least, that we are prop--I think profoundly
unprepared for the changes.  We have talked about them; we have thought
about
them, but we haven't yet recognized how much they are already here and
profoundly influencing current experience as they affect our communities
and
our--our broader society. <p>

Rodriguez reminded us that even fundamental change in our culture and in
our
sense of identity and in our day-to-day lives is not counternormative.  It
is
normal, it is an unremitting fact of our existence, and if we accept that
notion, what does that lead to.  It's something that we need to remind
ourselves of and our leaders of. <p>

Certainly that--that set of comments set the stage for--for our thinking
about
the sense of community that I heard the working group undertaking.  In
looking
back over our two-day--the two days of discussion that we had, what
strikes me
is a commonality of approaches, even from very different speakers, and
then
from our conversation and engagement with those speakers. <p>

Let me indicate four of them.  First, we've said over and over--or heard
in
different ways that it is possible and it is necessary to be proactive
about
repairing our political and social systems, that we will do that to
influence
individual behavior, strengthen leadership, but also societal behavior,
including strengthening communities; second, that doing so requires a
tactical
focus on concrete day-to-day issues and tasks as well as defining the
ideal
good society; third, while it's important to address the national and even
sometimes the international social dimensions of this problem, we also
need to
address our efforts to local needs and local concerns where, I think, many
of
us believe some of the most important changes can and will occur; fourth,
we
need to self-consciously demonstrate, model and map the possibility of
doing
better to show people what is possible, and we heard a lot of that
conversation in the description of the working groups. <p>

I--in--in the future meetings, with the help of our working groups, we
will
continue to move many of these ideas and agenda items forward.  It is our
goal
to have a lot of opportunity for the working groups at each of the next
biannual meetings to do their work.  And each meeting will focus, more or
less, on one of the working group areas.  And so, for example, at the
December
meeting--the next meeting, which will be in Washington, we will focus on
the
culture and behavior.  And it is our intent, although the--the working
group
may reframe this somewhat, to focus on the role of major
institutions--corporations, government and universities--in shaping and
reshaping public behavior.  And we already have some--some ideas about
that
and--and people lined up. <p>

A year from now we would move to leadership as the main focus for the
session,
addressing the responsibility of leaders, of all kinds, in creating and
changing the dynamics of our public culture.  And there the working group
will
have enough lead time to be very much involved in the planning of that
session--a--a--a meeting that we're intending for Chicago--I'm sorry, the
December meeting will be in Washington.
<p>
And finally, a year and a half from now, we move to Los Angeles for the
issue
of community--community building, community fragmentation, ways that will
help
us to take advantage of new opportunities for communities to participate
and--and move forward and enhance themselves. <p>

So I--I--I hope that you will find that there will be a continuing
dialectic
between the work of the working groups now and the work that will be
framed at
each of the sessions in a more integrative and synthetic way.  But to my
mind,
at least, these two meetings have been just enormously productive in
generating new kinds of thinking and--and some very clear and clearly
articulated domains in which many of you--many of us believe that we can
work
and make a profound difference.
<p>

<a name="discussion">
That's</a> my summary, so wh--what I'd like to do is really go around the
room
and
ask each of you for comments and thoughts as we--as we conclude.  Joyce.
<p>
APPLEBY:  I don't think I have anything to comment at this moment.
<p>
RODIN:  People can pass.
<p>
JOYCE:  I've had a tremendous amount of--of thoughts generated by,
particularly, today's session, though I would like to say that we had a
terrific working group and I--I expect that I'll have more to say later
on,
after I've worked with them. <p>

RODIN:  Mari.
<p>
MARI FITZDUFF:  Well, I just want to say it's been both a pleasure and a
privilege to
be with you.  And just--I was very conscious, Jay--I think you were
articulating where we will get to, and let us not lose sight of the fact
that
the wealth that is here, in terms of hopefully the wisdom that will
develop,
is articulated in such a way that it actually is heard and effective,
which
means identifying institutions, indentifying methods.  And I think even at
this stage we actually need to be thinking about those sorts of issues.
So--and this is respecting what I think will come out of it and it's--and
its
capacity to affect change.  So thank you.
<p>
Unidentified Woman #5:  I think I'm just going to think about it and maybe
come back after to talk about it.
<p>
RODIN:  Marty.
<p>
MARTY:  I--I ha--I don't have anything to add, either.  Thank you.
<p>
RODIN:  ...(Unintelligible).
<p>
Unidentified Man #8:  This is the general mood we have.
<p>
MARTY:  We're pooped.
<p>
RODIN:  Right.  I--I...
<p>
Woman #5:  We're--we're taking it all in.
<p>
RODIN:  There is a lot to take in and--and I think the opportunity to be
reflective is also important.  So I--I certainly don't want to give people
a...
<p>
MICHAEL SCHUDSON:  Well, I--I'll break that reflective mood, anyway.
One--one thought,
and it--in Rodriguez's presentation brought it back to mind, which
i--we're
a--we're a--we're talking about public life, but we're very public policy
oriented in the group.  And--and, you know, that's--that's who has been
brought together.  But as--as everyone noticed, he's a poet--he calls
himself
a journalist, but he's obviously a poet.  And--and we--so the arts have
been
sort of at the margins of some of our discussions.  But the arts make a
big
different in public life in bringing communities together.  But we did
have a
presentation last time from a--a theater group, but I--maybe there's some
way
to--to--to bring the arts more centrally into our discussion.
<p>
PAUL VERKUIL:  Well, I'd like to go back to this question of substance and
procedure,
because it does seem to me there's a point there that we might want to
spend
some time on, and that is, that what I basically got out of this session
most
is I learned an awful lot about some important issues.  And then we talked
about, you know, how you would structure a system that would encourage
more
reasoned discussion about these issues and that's fine.  But what I really
wanted to see us do more of, which I felt we were maybe too restrained,
was
actually go after some of these issues.
<p>
We had affirmative action here and we let it go.  I mean, the only
person--Bromwich--Lee said, `Hey, listen, what is merit?  You don't like
merit?' Well, we could have spent a lot--productively spent some time in
this
group deciding what do we mean by merit and is there such a concept?  You
know, I mean, Bud Trillon said, `Well, there's no such thing as merit.'
And,
you know, wh--well, that's worth talking about.
<p>
And perhaps what we haven't done is practice what we're all about, which
is
how to have a reasoned discourse to exemplify leadership.  Maybe we should
try
to do a little more of that.  You know, as--as enjoyable and--and positive
as--as these sessions are, I do think connecting them into some of these
issues more directly would make sense.  And I will just throw out at least
some of my reactions:  I thought Rodriguez was--was amazing, I have to
say.  I
mean, I--I feel like I've--will view the world differently after having
listened to him.  And the fact that he is a Chinese--I understand that
he's
Chinese.  I--I never could have understood that before today and I would
never
have understood it--and believed it un--until today.
<p>

And--and he opened up for me this--this wonderful real problem about
deciding
whether we should be talking about affirmative action or talking--and--and
multiculturalism.  Maybe there's a--another whole thing going on here that
we're missing.  I mean, we need to understand the relationship between
immigration and black-white and--and--and affirmative action.
<p>
When Paul Taylor talked about--I thought a fascinating issue was--he
talked
about our gerrymandered congressional districts creating a gap between
liberal
and--and conservatives.  I mean, are they encouraging more left-leaning
delegates than you'd get in any other situation?  I guess my question is:
Are
gerrymandered districts pro or an--or anti-community?  I'm not sure--no--I
don't think the answer's obvious.  But that's something we could talk
about,
it seems to me--or at least I would like to know the answer more about.
<p>
Another one is term limits:  Do term limits create or inhibit leaders and
leadership?  I don't know the answer to that, either, but again, it would
be
something in the context of our procedural discussion that would actually
get
us to--force us to take sides and--and maybe--maybe come up with a--some
answers. <p>

So I would argue that we are very--doing very well on the process side,
which
is what people like us do, basically--is talk about process and--and we're
very reasoned and civil and all of that, and that's good, but if we could
just
infuse it with just a little more, you know, `what do we care about and
what's
going on?' and then out of that, draw a process.
<p>
RODIN:  I'm--I think that's important.  In December, we had a--a
greater--we had a comfort level, I thought, on the second day with saying
that
we could envision ourselves as modeling a reasoned discourse by
participating
in one and that universities, after all, were places where things like
that
should happen and don't any longer, and that one of the roles and goals of
the
commission might be to--to do that and--and to engage in a deliberative
process and try to reach consensus and--and learn whether we can and how
and--and discuss an important issue or two or three.  All right.
<p>
I don't want us to feel like that is off the table, because I think you're
right, Paul, and I think that--that there was a lot of sympathy for that
view
in--in--in the--in the last meeting and--and today.  Bob..
<p>
ROBERT WIEBE:  Well, two--two points and then a footnote:  One of the
things that
really stood out for me, from Kevin Phillips, and with all the
reservations I
think most of us share about some of the things he said, the increasing
gap
between the rich and the poor was something that he emphasized and has
emphasized in his work.  And certainly I sensed that we are attuned to
these
issues of the rich and the poor and discrimination and so forth.  And yet,
I
find in other discussions that it's often very difficult, with concepts
like
community or civil society to necessarily bring in those kind of harsh
social
class dimensions in a--in a full way.  So I would encourage us to remember
Kevin Phyllis--Phillips' points about the increasing gap.
<p>
The other point that really stood out--and this was more from Richard
Rodriguez--is that many of the ways in which we conceptualize community or
ethnicity or race need to be rethought.  It's almost as if we've been
looking
at society through the lens of representational art and now we need to
think
in terms of pointillism or--or something else.  That's especially true, I
think, because our categories are of--the categories in which we
live--that
is, our day-to-day categories are much more fluid.  Transportation,
communications technology...
<p>
[tape change]
<p>
Unidentified Man #1:  ...important impact on our own personal identity.
And
if our identities our becoming different as individuals, then, inevitably,
that influences how we think of ourselves as citizens or it influences how
we
think with of our roles in communities or in institutions.
<p>
And a footnote is just to--I think Paul was saying this, too--to encourage
us
to be as specific as we possibly can, one of the reasons Richard
Rodriguez,
I think, communicated well, in addition to being a poet, is that he talked
very concretely.  And even though he was talking about abstract and
general
concepts, he provided us with images, and I think that's especially
important
because these--these are often rather abstract discussions that can
frankly be
exhausting, and so the more specific we can be, probably, the further
we'll
get.
<p>
RODIN:  Thank you.  Tom.
<p>
TOM BENDER:  I think I have only a footnote, and it's, I think, along the
same lines.
I--I think that it is really important for us to understand the historical
moment we are at, which is a historical moment that has both structural
characteristics and questions about formal ways of representing our lives,
but
it also has a real substance that's pressing in on us in--in some of
the--Paul
had--just articulated, but when--and Bob, but there are more as well.  And
I
think that--that the way we think about the kind of--whether it's
communities
or leadership we want cannot really be separated from the substance of
those
issues.  Fifty years from now all this might look very different as 50
years
ago they did.
<p>
The two--this is going back to Michael Piore�s point.  I think that some
of
the difficulties have to do with the substantive issues, and just to take
inequality--as we seem to be embracing a new and higher levels of
inequality,
that's not unrelated to the way political leadership works and the way
money,
as opposed--I mean, used to matter how many voters you had on your side.
Now
it depends on how many donors you have on your side.  That's not unrelated
to
the kind of substantive issues.  And--anyway, I just--I think there's a
particular moment we're in, and I think we should start very much from
that
moment, which is a--which is a substantive set of problems.
<p>
RODIN:  Tom, you're the historian and we made a--a point in December of
focusing on some of--of other periods, and because we wanted to say, at
least
at that time, that we--we need to understand the extent to which this is a
special moment and the extent to which, although the issues that we're
grappling with may be unique to this moment, history, of course, tells us
that
in every era there have been issues with which society grappled and that
those
issues framed the debate as well as the debate framing the issues.  I--I
was
persuaded by that argument.  Are--are you asking me now to think something
different?
<p>
BENDER:  No, no.  Oh, I'm not sure.  I mean, I--I would say--and, in fact,
the
talk I gave--that one was arguing in certain structural ways our political
culture works differently than it did before.  But I don't know that we
have
to say we have a unique historical moment.  We have a...
<p>
RODIN:  Particular.
<p>
BENDER:  We have a particular--exactly...
<p>
RODIN:  OK.
<p>
BENDER:  ...a particular...
<p>
RODIN:  That's what I wanted to understand.
<p>
BENDER:  ...historical moment, but we also have--if--if one wants to talk
about
the structure of politics or any other domain, we also have a content and
that
content plays back.  It is harder to make the--I mean, certain kinds
of--at
certain moments, one can talk about class and equality rather easily; at
other
moments--you know, now we can use the work capitalist.  You know, in the
1950s, social theory didn't have the work capitalism?  It dropped out.
That
was--that was not speakable, not because there was any sense or--it was
just
sort of odd.  Well, that's now come back in so we can do a little bit of
that.
Anyway, we--at certain moments, the--the substantive issues play back...
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm. <p>

BENDER:  ...in--in different ways.
<p>
RODIN:  OK.
<p>
JOEL FLEISHMAN:  Could we, perhaps, suggest that maybe if there are a
whole list of sort
of creative specific substantive questions that relate to what we've
already
done, would they be sent in to you?
<p>
RODIN:  Yeah.  We'll start them on a list serve and then let people...
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  And then see what--what comes out of that.
<p>
RODIN:  Yeah.  Great idea.
<p>
Unidentified Man #2:  This--this is exactly the kind of thing we can
continue
on the commission list serve and circulate it back out to you on the
commission Web page and keep it going also by--in hard copy.

RODIN:  True.
<p>
Unidentified Woman #2:  There are two issues I'd like to raise.  One is, I
was
very struck in the three sessions with formal presentations how we as a
group
seem to define ourselves by our reactions, and I think we defined
ourselves in
interesting ways that should add to our deliberations and our sense of our
possibilities and our limitations.  Joyce pointed out in our working group
meeting that she was somewhat delighted by our response to Kevin Phillips,
and
we recoiled from his cynicism and embraced a kind of undiluted idealism
that
we want to act, we want to contribute, we want to have a positive role.  I
think in the--the--Christopher Edley's presentation we reacted very
positively
to his notion of a kind of intellectual map of a thought process and we
all
embraced that as something very positive, I think bespeaking our
intellectual
orientation, and our fascination with thought process and the way in which
reasoned discourse operates and can be mapped out.
<p>
I thought--and I've said this to a couple of people--that our reaction to
Richard Rodriguez was fascinating in some of the same ways that you
remarked,
Michael, which was we kept trying to make him a social scientist.
Everyone
wanted policy implications and to pin him down, and he just resisted that.
And I think that he embodied the notion of the transformative moment that
Chris Edley was talking about.  His is the book one would read in order
to--to
be transformed and that, I think, should alert us to the limitations of
our
social science orientation and our political public policy orientation,
and
the ways in which we have allies elsewhere who have the same goals, but
perhaps different methods, and how we can use those methods.
<p>
Now this relates to my second issue, which is what is our audience?  And
it
seems to me that, as we move through these working groups and through
developing products, that we need to have a better sense of our audience,
because Richard Rodriguez is going to be able to be effective with one
sort of
audience; public policy recommendations may work with a different sort of
audience.  And since this thought sort of began to fester in my mind, I--I
just have been writing down some of the remarks that people have made,
that
suggest to me we have very unclear notions of our audience.  Relentless
teaching, but who are our students?  An inert populace that we wish to
arouse--that seems to me to suggest a very different set of approaches
than a
relentless teaching approach.
<p>
New York Times articles about leadership--that, again, implies another
sort of
audience.  Clinton--is he our audience?  I think the Christopher Edley
talk
had a whole--half of it was about, you know, how do you talk to the
president?
And I think we were all sitting there thinking, `And what would I say to
Clinton if I were in that room at that moment?' So I think as we move
through
these working groups and think about the different sorts of methods and
think
about who we are, as we demonstrated in our responses to these three
presentations, maybe we should also try to think about who are we
directing
our product towards?  Who are we able to direct it toward, given the
limitations of who we are, and who can we most effectively direct it
toward as
we evolve what indeed it is?  Because I think that will very much shape
how
the working groups will--will evolve.
<p>
RODIN:  Jim. <p>

JAMES FISHKIN:  Well, I feel almost like I wandered into--briefly into
Habermas' ideal
speech situation or something, where we can--we can get--you know, only
the
force of the better argument is supposed to prevail and we can ans--every
question can be--we can get staff to help us answer any particular
question we
want, and every argument should be met by a counterargument and all
question
are open.  The thing is that I always wondered about a Habermasian ideal
speech situation is some people think that if you actually tried to do
one, it
might last 1,000 years and you might--and we don't have 1,000 years.  We
have
a couple, which is a great luxury.  You saw how surprised Kevin Phillips
was
when he heard our timetable.  But at some point we're going to have to
clarify
things, but we don't necessarily have to do it prematurely, yet.  But I
think
it's going to demand almost infinite patience for us to--the more--the
more we
keep things open, the more interesting and original, probably, the results
will be.
<p>
Now I'll tell you, for me the quest--the question that interests me, the
overarching question that interests me has clarified itself.  It's not
unconnected to the interests I came in with, so--but, nevertheless, it
seems
to relate to a lot.  It's sort of like how can we facilitate a public
space
where a democracy of more engaged citizens can function.  It's something
like
that.  How can we facilitate a public space where a democracy of more
engaged
citizens can function?  And that leads me to think about specifics that
are a
little different from--I mean, I--I--I think--for national dialogue, we
then
have to focus more on the media than we have.  We really do.  But we can
focus
on the media in lots of different ways, and one way I'd like to see--I
mean,
I've always--I've been very interested in--in Jay's work on civic
journalism
and his critics, and I think it might be interesting and illuminating for
us
to get Jay's account of what he's doing and his critic's account--I
don't--I
didn't clear this with him so I don't know if he felt uncomfortable about
that, but it would--you know, because--because...
<p>
JAY ROSEN:  I have many.
<p>
FISHKIN:  ...because the thing about Jay's--the debate about that is a
debate
about whether the media should be harnessed in the service of democracy or
whether the media are selling commodities which are basically--they're
connecting advertisers with--with--with consumers.  And so it's a
conceptual
debate, and I think it--it's--the fact that it--it--he's run into so much
hostility is very illuminating and reflective, and might help us think
about
anything we might want to say about the role of the media in a democracy.
<p>
So it--that's--that's something that should be part of the debate.  I
mean,
Jay is here.  Jay is very controversial, but he's also very illuminating,
in
my view. <p>

Now it seems to me we--we the--it leads me to the media; it leads me to
education, because one of the things about--when I say a democracy of more
engaged citizens, I also think about how the role of citizen has
atrophied,
and I think we ought to think about, you know, that old standby, civics
education and what little there is of it or what--or whether there is
anything
in the educational system that might be done to facilitate a democracy of
more
engaged citizens.  So I think that should be one our agenda somewhere.  At
least if we're Habermasian in our aspirations, that we can look into
everything and this wonderful staff will help facilitate that.  So--so I
think
of the media, I think of education and I think of experiments in civic
engagement. <p>

And so one that I--I mentioned in our working group was I have these
colleagues at the Kettering Foundation, who facilitated their National
Issues forums,   which involved thousands of local groups every year, that
deliberate about the public issues of that year.  And they facil--they
deliberate in a ordi--they have carefully developed and balanced briefing
materials and trained moderators, but there are about 2,500 such groups
that
meet around the country every year.  That's an example of trying to make
citizenship more than just casting a vote.  It makes it more--it
makes--it--it
adds to the fact that there ought to be some seriously engaged, balanced
discussion.  Now 2,500 groups is a lot by some measures, but if you think
of
all the people who vote in American society, it's miniscule and it's
nothing.
<p>
But it's an interest--it's an ex--it's--it's an effort in institutional
innovation.  But--and--and I think that we ought to think about a list of
comparable such efforts to somehow get a--a public space where you can get
a
democracy of more engaged citizens connected to public problems, so we can
deal with specific public problems but I think as exemplars of trying to
change the process.
<p>
RODIN:  Great.  Great.  Tha--that--that is exciting and I think we will
come back to--to those and create these exemplars, and--and move that
forward.
That's very interesting.  Joel.
<p>
FLEISHMAN:  I think the--the discussion here has, thus far, been very
helpful,
in--rat--in this particular session and I think in the whole--in the whole
two
days--some very exciting presentations.  I--I--let me just comment--just a
couple--on a couple of points that have been made.  With respect to Jim's
sense of public--of hi--hi--his particular interest in the public space, I
think that--I'm interested in those sort of the second level, intermediate
space--public spaces in institutions.  I've said it before and several
others
have had--you know, lots of the institutions that make up the public
domain,
as a whole, whether they're universities or, as someone said, labor unions 
or
corporations, the issue of community as it--as it involves those
institutions
is a very important institut--is a--is a very important domain, it seems,
for
me, in what we're talking about here.
<p>
To look at--I think it's useful, several of you point out, look at
univ--look
at institutions across the board that bring people together.  Whether
they're
Don Randall's mention of--I think it was Don who mentioned the poets,
the--poet groups that bring--that--groups of poets that bring people
together
across racial and ethnic lines, professional groups, drama groups--a whole
variety of institutions in this society that are succeeding.
<p>
I mean, Mari can talk about the groups that have been--that have brought
together people across lines in--in--in Northern Ireland, where I think we
have need to get a better sense of those, and we've talked about that so
I--there's no point in--in proliferating it, but I think it's important to
establish--to learn more about and establish some connection with
the--whether
it's the Kettering Group--the Kettering--whether it's--Martin--Marty has
talked about the--his involvements with the various humanities councils
around, which are doing discussions about this same kind of thing--just
connecting up with them.
<p>
The--the issue of the press is really very important because--and--and
public
journalism.  We've got two persons here--one person who's a great advocate
of
public journalism, another person, Michael Shudsen, is writing a book on
public journalism.  And it's an example of the major national institution
which we all think is terribly important, the press, and--and the attempt
of
some particular newspapers to try to build community locally.  That's what
they're really trying to do.  They're trying to reach out and engage the
various subcommunities and the communities in--in their catchment basin to
get
them more involved and to--and to create a more vibrant local politics.
That's what we're talking about here, one of the major areas.  And I think
the
notion of--really of looking at that question and--and really kicking it
around is not just--I--I--I--it isn't the bipolar model that--as I
understand
it, that Jim presented, is between, you know, more civic engagement
and--and
trying to sell products through advertising.
<p>
FISHKIN:  No.
<p>
JOEL:  It is--there's a third point, in which the point--and I think it's
a
real point.  That is a point that the--that the--that the elite press has
made
in criticizing public journalism, which is was--which is to the effect
that,
`Look, we're out to report objective news.  We're not out to create news.'
That's a legitimate argument.  I mean, many of us--there may be lots of
ways
of getting around the problems, but I think it's really important to
recognize
that there's a serious question there.  But the issue of the press and the
potential of the press and the problems created by the press in dealing
with
these issues of community that we're talking about--and leadership, I
think,
is a really--would be a terrific focus for us and--and--and it would also,
I
think, give us a chance--I like what Paul said about the importance of
getting
involved in some serious argumentation, reasoned discussions.  The guys up
there on the wall who wrote the Constitution had a lot of arguments and
they're--and--and--and I would love to see us really--really get
into--into
tough arguments with one another about some of these things, the issue of
what
is merit was a very good example.  That's just some random thoughts.
<p>
Woman #1:  Kathleen.
<p>
KATHLEEN HALL JAMESON:  Do you know these microphones are glued to the
table?  The--as
people talk about media, I think it's important that we remember a couple
of
things.  The first is that the structures of media right now are not
working
to increase the likelihood that you're going to hear arguments you
disagree
with, and to the extent that that is a model we're working from implicitly
as
we talk about what we're looking for as a civically engaged model, I think
we've got a structural problem, which is the fragmentation in the media,
the
increasing number of channels and the satellite capacity of talk radio's
increasing the likelihood that the like-minded will talk to the
like-minded,
and not be unex--not be exposed to the alternative constructions of
reality.
<p>
Unidentified Man #3:  Cyberspace, too.
<p>
JAMESON:  And I think that--I think the Internet is going to exacerbate
that,
not minimize that, because of all the things that we know about patterns
and
selective exposure and selective retention.  And so I think there's some
things that are structural that are working against the underlying
assumptions
that we're making about what the democratic ideal ought to look like.
<p>
Secondly, I think we can't ignore the extent to which money really is
speech,
you know, in--in the way that Buckley and Vallejo, you know, met.  But in
a
perverse way, what that meant--means is that those who have money have
speech,
and as a result, the thing that I--I assume we all talked about briefly,
the
rise of issue advocacy through paid advertising is a very recent
phenomenon.
The first major instance of it is the health-care reform debate of '93 and
'94, in which over $100 million was put in place very selectively around
the
commun--around the country to create communities bonded together by fear
of
change, and at--and in interest of large corporate structures who have no
self-interest in seeing the uninsured insured and as a result there wasn't
a
voice for the uninsured in a debate that should have had that as a central
voice, since there are real policy implications for not having those
individuals covered.
<p>
And also real humane issues that are--cannot be addressed in the absence
of
insurance for everyone in this--in this culture.  And so the role of money
in--in--as it creates communities through its access to speech, I think,
is an
underlying question that we've got to grapple with, because I think many
of
the ideals that we're presupposing are the ideals of an earlier age that
are
no longer a possible or readily possible in an area--an era of media
fragmentation, an era in which money is so dominant in determining whose
voice
is heard.
<p>
RODIN:  Thanks.
<p>
Unidentified Man #4:  Can you just add, by the way, ballot issues?  I
think,
Kathleen, it would be--part of what you're saying is--and there was a nice
incipient debate, again on the cutting room floor, but maybe we can bring
back
was Ab Mikva and Kevin Phillips, you know--are these a good thing or not?
And
then what are the implications for paid advertising for hearing contrary
views?  Does it--does it help or hinder?
<p>
RODIN:  Right, referenda.
<p>
Man #4:  A community--referenda, that's what I'm talking, baff--ballot...
<p>
RODIN:  Mm.
<p>
Man #4:  ...issues and referendas and things of that nature.  That's
another
one that's really been teed up.  Excuse me.
<p>
RODIN:  Tom.
<p>
BENDER:  I'm--I'm struck by--given the enormity of the task that we're
working
on, it seems to me that a lot of our success in dealing with that will be
whether we can build an electronic dialogue in the interim time period in
which we meet, in terms of continuing the dialogue and at the same time
moving
the dialogue along to reach some conclusions.  It seems to me if we don't
succeed in doing that, it's going to be very difficult to--to do this on a
biannual basis. <p>

Second, I--I worry about have we really addressed sufficiently the issue
of
the lack of connection that the populace feels with the political system
as a
whole--and I'm saying political system writ large--I mean, not just
Washington--but not feeling connected.  If you--if you listen and I'll--we
all
listen to Richard Rodriguez.  If you pitch--if you picture for a moment
his
description of a Los Angeles and say to yourself, `How many people in Los
Angeles, as he described it, feel connected to today's political process?'
I think the answer would be very few.
<p>
And if you, therefore, talk about engaging citizens, we have a long way to
go.
And thinking about that in a creative way, I'm struck by the fact, yes,
assimilation happens, but the finished product, to the extent it's ever
finished, is always changing.  I mean, the assimilation causes change, and
given where our culture exists today, are we really focused enough on how
do
you get people engaged--not just how do you get people in this room, but
how
do you get engaged millions of people to feel that they can be engaged,
whether it has to be--whether it has to do with garbage collection in
their
neighborhood or health care, but on issues that impact their day-to-day
life,
how do they engage?  And how do we create the environment in which it is
more
likely that they can be engaged and feel engaged, and I'm not sure we've
really come to grips with how, as opposed to describing...
<p>
RODIN:  That--that happens. <p>

BENDER:  ...the culture we don't like, the behavior we don't like,
the--the
leadership we don't like, but are we really struggling with how do you
engage
people...
<p>
RODIN:  Good point.
<p>
BENDER:  ...feel connected.
<p>
Unidentified Man #5:  First, I--I hope we can do what Paul suggested and
that
is, as an internal exercise, just see if we cannot have this so-called
civilized discourse and--and find a way to a decisional process about any
of
the subjects, whether it's about issues or his speech or whatever,
something
on which we don't have a--a--a pretty substantial consensus to start out
with,
and I'm sure we can find such subjects, because I think that if nothing
else
it'll illustrate for us just how hard it is to--to stay cool and calm
about
some of these--these color words we use in our discussion.
<p>
The other thing--and this has been mentioned many times--I still don't
know
who our audience is or who we hope our audience or audiences will be, and
therefore I hope we can continue to keep the--the description of what the
product is going to be as loose as possible.  I--I think if we end up with
a
report or a series of reports, we will ensure that it reaches the smallest
possible and least desirable audience we can imagine, and therefore, if
there's any place our ingenuity is needed, it's how to figure out
alternative
products that will reach out to the people we're talking about, whether
it's
to the ones that I'm not sure we'll ever get to, or at least to some
others
more than the normal people but those normal six people who read reports
that
nobody else reads.
<p>
RODIN:  One of the ways that we lured some of you here, was by promising
you that we would be unlikely to write reports as our finished product,
but--but look for things that are more imaginative and, indeed, more
influential.
<p>
Man #5:  Good.  And then the last point is as I sit and listen to
this--this
marvelous plethora of--of--of ingen--minds, with all these great ingenious
ideas, I worry that we don't overwhelm ourselves because of our appetites
and
put so much on our plates that we just have a case of indigestion.  I
think
it's going to be very difficult to sift and...
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
Man #5:  ...and winnow some of these great ideas that we've heard about
and
talked about, and bring them down to a size that we can chew.
<p>
RODIN:  Important.  Don.
<p>
DONALD RANDEL:  If one thinks about the presentations we've heard in the
last two days,
and making allowances for the talent of the individuals as performers, the
two
most riveting, certainly, were rooted in questions of race and ethnicity.
And
I think what's grinding on us, what's sort of gnawing at us about modern
life
has a lot to do with problems of race and ethnicity, and that it's,
therefore,
going to be essential for us to foreground those very questions in our
discussion, in one way or another.

Secondly, I think we need to examine closely the kinds of communities that
most of us, in fact, know best.  Most of us are academics, and as we try
to
think about how communities function and what kinds of attitudes towards
rath--race and ethnicity and public discourse that ought to prevail in
society, we would do well to look in our own back yards and see how we're
doing in universities, and what functions and what doesn't function there.
Universities ought to be the site of the thrashing-out of many of these
issues, and yet we have this feeling we're not too good at it in the
university, either, that we have a kind of reluctance to talk about hard
things candidly with one another.
<p>
There's an increasing inclination to be silent unless your particular
piece of
the turf is challenged, and it would be well for us, simply because we
have a
rich body of experience to bring to bear, to think about our very own
communities and our daily lives, in respect to these things, at least
along
with, if not before, trying to rearrange the national landscape.
<p>
RODIN:  Jay. <p>

JAY ROSEN:  First, thanks to my colleagues for mentioning civic
journalism, which
has been obsessing me for s--for seven years.  It is a real world
experiment
in trying to improve public liberation in a civic space you--you--by
addressing a particular institution of importance in that space, which is
the
press.  And as Joel correctly points out, the, let us say, alternatives to
it
are two, not--not one, as Jim said.  A commer--a com--purely commercial
conception of journalism is not a civic conception of journalism, on the
one
hand, but a purely professional technical objective notion of journalism
is
also in--intentioned with a civic orientation, and those--those tensions
are
important for us to understand.  So I want to underline that.
<p>
The second and other--only other point I want to make is in Judith's
original
letter to us, inviting us to be members of this august body--I remember
reading it and I read the list of names as--as--already associated with
it,
and, of course, I knew immediately that I wanted to join that company, but
what got me excited about it was a line in--in your original letter that
went
something like the commission should stu--study these problems perhaps
by--through the--best through the deliberations of the commission itself,
through the members itself.  And I thought that was really interesting.
In
other words, why not experiment upon ourselves?
<p>
And in that light, just imagine this room exactly like this one, arranged
in
this horseshoe way, but with a table in the middle.  And sitting at the
table
are--picture in your minds Chris Edley, David Bromwich, Bill Wilson, Amy
Gutman, Claude Steele, Marie Fitzduff, Lani Guinier, and they are there to
try
and have a different kind of conversation about affirmative action, about
race, which they're going to ta--first of all, reflect upon their goal
before
they do it, and we're going to reflect upon what they did after they do
it.
See?  Imagine that.  In other words, th--this space in between us becomes
a
kind of theater for our reflections.
<p>
And they do it, we listen to it and then we just talk about what we heard.
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
ROSEN:  Because through a method like that, we can a--we can find out the
answer
to an interesting question which is:  Do we know how to have a better
civ--more civil dialogue about hot-button issues?  Do we, ourselves, know?
And by listening to some of our colleagues we could find out.  And then
imagine if they go back to their seats and Jim Fishkin, Ab Mikva, Michael
Shudsen, Kathleen Jamieson, Joyce Appleby and Cass Eunstein take their
seats
to talk about campaign finance reform or--or politics and media or--or
something similar.  And--and we will listen to them and see how well they
do
at this aspiration that we have in our minds, and then--then we talk about
what we just saw.  You see?
<p>
So I think we need to--to do that.  We need to see if we know how to have
a
substantially different and more deliberative dialogue than the culture we
are
claiming it has lost--claiming it--and the culture that has lost it.  And
it
would just be interesting to see if--if--if we can do it.  I don't know if
we
can or not. <p>

RODIN:  We will work to cre--I--I hear you and I think this is
fascinating.
I--and I see a lot of nods, whether it's exactly that format or not, and
we
can interact in our--in our...
<p>
ROSEN:  It can be any format.
<p>
RODIN:  But any format, but the idea is ab... <p>

ROSEN:  I mean, it's just--it's just the concept.
<p>
RODIN:  The process is absolutely right and we will definitely construct
such opportunities for the December and--and ongoing meetings, because
they're
really well-taken points. <p>

Unidentified Woman #3:  Well, I just want to say that I--I've learned a
lot
from--from these two days, also from the previous meeting.  I really keep
learning about America and American society.  I feel very enriched.  It
enriches my thought about my own society and all sorts of comparative
thoughts.  I'm enriched, both by the formal presentations and not less, I
think, by the informal interactions with some of the fantastic
peoples--people
around this table, in fact.  Many are missing, but I'm talking about them,
too. <p>

The second point is--a specific point:  I think this group needs to be a
little more clear about whether they really want or need--whether it wants
or
needs the outsiders, the foreigners--the non-Americans--and if the answer
is
yes, I think the idea originally had some thought about it and some
validity.
And I still feel that if the--if it's still a valid idea, then I think--I
think some thought should be put into how to make better use of us
three--it's
just three of us--as a resource for--for this group.  I think it can be
done
and I think that perhaps it needs a little bit more thought.
<p>
I was struck, for instance, that in the three working groups it--the
thought
wasn't given to the--to the point that each one should be in--in a
separate
group.  We were--two of us together and then one other in another group,
and
it--and a third group had none.  And I--maybe it's all right.  I just
don't
know whether any thinking was put into that, and I encourage a little more
thought on that and, of course, I'll be very happy to join into--join in
this
thinking.
<p>
And lastly, the third point, I just feel I have to say this:  I am really
literally--really overwhelmed by the level of organization and the
smoothness
of the operation throughout.  And I just feel that I want to say a
personal
thank you--a big thank you to--to the very outstanding staff that we are
privileged to have.
<p>
RODIN:  Thank you.
<p>
Unidentified Man #6:  ...very much.
<p>
RODIN:  Bob, last word.
<p>
REOBERT WIEBE:  My ear catches around the table much the same tension I
tried earlier to
articulate, which I'll rephrase this way.  There are those around the
table--and I'm particularly impressed by Mary and Jay's quite eloquent
expression of it, who ask us to give the best--start from where we are and
our
values, and do our very best to envision the best world we can from them.
<p>
It's a kind of an ideal world:  What would it look like if we did our very
best, starting from what we know and who we are?  If--if I understand what
Tom
Luce said, the alternative is to start where a lot of people are, and to
try
to understand where they are, and to address our energies to try to find
ways
of making connections with them, helping them make connections with
institutions.  But it starts not with what we believe and how we could
take
what we believe and formulate it in the most dazzling way possible, but
how do
we take difficult, rough, largely obscure, still, but vast social problems
and
understand them well enough to say something useful about them?
<p>
And I think we want to do both--that is, I don't think--I'm not asking do
you
like A or do you like B?  We like A and B, but they're not the same--we
don't
start at the same places; we don't--we aren't challenging ourselves in the
same way.  And I think we have to be very self-conscious about how we're
investing our energies.  Are we doing it--and my sense is the default
setting
is we start with where we are and we do the most dazzling thing we can
with
our intelligence.
<p>
But I think there is a powerful impulse around the table to be useful, not
just to say something that we, in this room--the question of audience
brings
that up, too--to whom are we speaking?  Are we talking to one another, are
we
trying to talk to some as yet undefined, much broader public?  I think we
want
to do that.  I think we have been accused of being liberals.  I think
that's
not--not an unreasonable kind of vague summary of our inclinations.  We
have
strong social justice impulses.  We want to do something useful.
<p>
So number one, I think we need to know what we're doing, at which level,
to
what end, and how we're dividing our quite-limited energies along those
two
paths.
<p>
Unidentified Man #7:  Judith, can I just add one comment to what you said?
<p>
RODIN:  Sure.
<p>
Man #7:  Wha--what I was trying to articulate, if--if you take Jay's
idea--and
I think you're correct in the way you laid it out--but let's say we--we
did
Jay's idea or some form of that.  At the same time we're trying to figure
out
can we do this ourselves?  It seems to me we also have to keep in mind, in
what we produced--assuming we produce something--can that be replicated?
What
lessons did we learn from that, that would make it applicable to Los
Angeles--if I use that phrase--so that it is applicable to more than us in
terms of what did we gain from that exercise?  I think that's what I'm
trying
to put on the table.
<p>
RODIN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
Man #7:  For instance, if we studied leadership, what does it also tell us
about followship?  And I think that's--if we just keep in mind trying to
bridge those two is, I think, what I'm trying to lay on the table.
<p>
WIEBE:  Well, I may have invoked your name in vain.
<p>
Man #7:  No, I think--no, I...
<p>
WIEBE:  It may be that I'm just speaking out of Bob Weevy's impulses and
not
yours.  My own impulse is to say it is a different matter to try to start
where Mr.  Rodriguez's constituency--if that's quite the word--his
fra--his
con--is contextual group is.  We haven't tried to do that very much here.
<p>
Man #7:  Right.
<p>
WIEBE:  And it's a ex--mine own experience is exceedingly difficult.  It's
extraordinarily difficult to try to enter into minds of people whose lives
are
very, very different from my own.  I think that's not an unreasonable
challenge for the commission at least to entertain.  I think we would feel
better about our work if we thought it had some utility beyond speaking to
people like us.
<p>
RODIN:  In fact, I'm reminded, as we leave Philadelphia and--and have our
next three sessions in different cities, and by the historic site in which
we
find ourselves, that the framers of the Constitution didn't say `us vs.
them';
they said, `We the people.'  And I think that we are thinking about ways
that
we, the people, can once again reframe ourselves and--and be a more
participatory, informed, engaged populace.  And all the people--the people
are
different now.  We need to understand the different people that make up
our
populace and how that intersects with both the opportunities and the
challenges that we have as a society, but we still are we the people.
<p>
Unidentified Man #8:  One very quick item:  What I took--the most
significant
thing I took from Rodriguez's talk is that we don't have much diversity on
this commission, and I think it's too late now to reshape the commission
and
try to sort of cobble around and do that.  But it is not too late for
working
groups to be encouraged and be perhaps empowered, to make connections with
very different kinds of groups than we represent around the table, and to
do
our best, as we are working out our agendas, to engage in dialogue with
people
with whom we normally don't speak.
<p>
RODIN:  It's crucial.
<p>
I thank you all for really a wonderful two days and we will see you in
December, but communicate with you in many different forms over the next
several months.  Thank you.
<p>
Unidentified Man #9:  The bus awaits at the corner.  There are also some
cabs
for those who are in a--in urgent need of transportation and Bill Boltz
will
direct you in the appropriate directions.
