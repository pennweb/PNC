<b>SUMMARY OF FIRST MEETING (6/12/97)<br>
</b>
by Stephen P. Steinberg

<br>
<br>

<p>
The Working Group's first meeting took place on June 12, 1997 and focused
on two issues:

<menu>
<li>limiting the group's focus to public behaviors (i.e., excluding
private behaviors, such as drug-use, divorce, unmarried pregnancies,
abortion, and "road rage"); and
<br><br>
<li>setting itself the initial task of redefining behavioral
       norms in the public sphere.
</menu>

The group started from the presupposition that we are living in a time of
profound change, when there is great and widespread dissatisfaction with
public culture and with the character of interpersonal interactions and
exchanges within the public sphere.  But, as Commission members repeatedly
articulated throughout the two-day Commission meetings, there are
alternative conceptions of what public behavior might look like which can
be put together into a coherent, systematic vision.  Both leaders and the
general public "want to do better," but they need to be shown in concrete
ways how it is possible to do better.
<p>
The group agreed to take as its initial task the work of articulating such
a normative vision of what interpersonal interaction and behavior should
be
in the public realm.  This involves redefining some of the traditional
goods of democractic societies -- some conceptions which may never have
been clearly defined and others that may need to be redefined in the light
of experience or contemporary circumstances.
<p>
In this task of defining what it regards as the normative standards of all
kinds of public interactions, it was suggested that the group focus on a
limited number of areas in which it thinks those norms can be usefully
redefined.   This process should also help the group to explore more
carefully the origins of the current dissatisfaction with the character of
public behavior, and thus, to describe and analyse the problem of "a
culture of intolerance" more clearly and concretely.
<p>
Some of the norms the group might look at -- and this is not yet a
determinative list -- are:
<menu>

<li>the private/public distinction and where the boundaries of privacy
should be drawn;
<br><br>

<li>tolerance, especially regarding intolerant groups, absolutism,
fundamentalism, and intolerant behaviors;
<br><br>

<li>inclusiveness and access;
<br><br>

<li>isolation of groups and individuals from one another and the lack of
engagement across differences;
<br><br>

<li>equity/fairness distinctions, including issues of rights and the
absolutism that is so often associated with claims to rights; and
<br><br>

<li>adversarial styles of dispute resolution as they relate to the larger
culture (i.e., not as a professional issue in specific professions, such
as the law).
</menu>
Though the working group plans to start with a specific focus on the
public
sphere and with the task of defining the norms of interactions that occur
in public, it anticipates that other issues -- such as the role of
institutions (e.g., the media, religious institutions, corporations,
governement, universities)  in determining and reinforcing behavioral
norms
-- will grow out of the conversation regarding the re-definition of these
normative concepts.
<p>
[Though it was not discussed during the meeting, one could imagine here
collecting or commissioning research on a number of issues that might
inform the Working Group's and the Commission's consideration of normative
changes.  For example:
<menu>
<li>current behavioral norms,
<br><br>

<li>attitudes towards change in public norms
<br><br>

<li>systematic behaviors that contribute to the  destruction or weakening
of norms;
<br><br>

<li>preferences regarding the direction of changes, and
<br><br>

<li>comparisons with or assessments of societies in which norms are very
different than those currently operative in the United States. -sps]
</menu>

<p>
In the light of the group's focus on interactions and exchanges that occur
in public, rather than private, the working group has tentatively decided
to change its name to "Culture and Public Behavior" (though other variants
on this are possible) in order to emphasize that it wants to focus on the
public sphere and interactions that occur therein, not on what goes on at
home and in the bedroom, and in places of that sort.
<p>
The group's first task is to begin redefining the norms of public behavior
and to articulate thereby its vision of how our society can "behave
better"
in "the commons."  It is hoped that the group could have a draft to
present
to the Commission at the start of the December meeting.  This would set
the
stage for the major plenary sessions of that meeting which will focus on
the responsibilities of major institutions -- corporations, government,
and
universities -- to set and reinforce such norms and standards for public
behavior and a concluding session in which the Commission might consider
the working group's proposals.
<p>
This suggests several immediate questions for continued discussion via
listserv:
<ol>
<li>Is this is a useful way in which to proceed?  In particular, do those
who were unable to attend the first meeting have alternative or
supplementary suggestions?
<br><br>

<li>Does the group need to add to, subtract from, or re-name some of the
normative areas it wants to look at?
<br><br>

<li>How should the group go about the task of re-conceptualizing norms in
these areas?  (Dividing them up amongst the members is one obvious
possibility.)
<br><br>

<li>Are there other tasks the group or the Commission staff should
undertake at this stage to further the group's work?
<br><br>

<li>In particular, would the collection or commissioning of research
regarding some of the topics suggested above (i.e., current behavioral
norms, attitudes towards change in public norms, systematic behaviors that
weaken norms, preferences regarding the direction of changes, or
comparisons with and assessments of societies in which norms are very
different, or other topics) be of utility at this stage?
