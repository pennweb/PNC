From: Claude Steele <steele@PSYCH.STANFORD.EDU>

Dear All,
I wanted to pitch in a brief note of response to the exchange of memos
among our group--essentially endorsing the direction of the discussion
that Edna's note on euergeticism takes us.  I found Niel's prompting
discussion very, very useful.  And I believe that a discussion of
definitions will inevitably accompany all of our discussion--they are
essential to it. But I am still trying to secure my own Gestalt of what we
want to include in our concept of civility--so I am reluctant to be too
definitionally foreclosed. 


In that regard, my thinking focuses on what can be loosely called public
behavior--realizing that careful distinctions may have to eventually be
made.  And in that arena there seem to be two dimensions of civil
behavior: one is what might be called the decency-offensiveness dimension
and the other might be what is typically called civic responsibility--sens
civique as the French put it--the dimension of public behavior that I took
Edna's memo to be recommending to us.  What I have in mind here is the
Kennedy-esque "ask not what your country can do for you but what you can
do for your country"  norm of public responsibility.  It represents an
identification with, and a commitment to the commons of society.  And in
this notion of commons, I would be quite broad.  That is, I would be
willing to include in it a concern with the needy as well as a concern
with projects and places for the public good.  The War on Povery, for
example, is a project that can be thought of as a project motivated by a
concern for the commons of society as well as by a concern for the poor. 

At any rate, I see this dimension of public civility declining as much as
the decency-offensiveness dimension.  In fact, it is hard to believe that
their mutual decline is not related.  If one thinks of the difference
between the Kennedy era and the self-oriented Reagan era, one gets this
point.  Relatively (not absolutely) speaking, the Kennedy era was an era
of much greater emphasis on public service and commitment to the public
interest--in all of its aspects from the level of culture reflected in its
public buildings to its interest in not being a society unable to confront
its inequalities.  By contrast, in the Reagan era, we had the "greed is
good" epithet of Gordon Gecko in the movie Wall Street.  And with these
differences in civic responsibility for the commons of society, there were
of course profound differences in the decency-offensiveness dimensions of
public civility.  Not that one development entirely explains the other. 
But in our discussions of the culture of behavior, it seems unlikely to me
that they are independent. 

I also believe that keeping both of these dimensions of civility in view
as we work--and eventually pronounce--is important.  First, as noted, I
believe they are integrally related, so that to understand one will
require that we understand both.  But even strategically there is an
advantage.  Stressing both dimensions implicates all of society, rather
just those who the media represents to us as the most uncivil in the
conventional sense of that word.  To stress just the decency-offensiveness
dimension of civil behavior will miss the full picture, I believe, and
wind up giving us an unbalanced, blaming message and tone. 

Enough for now.
Claude

MEMORANDUM

DATE:   October 3, 1997

TO:     Members of Working Group on Culture and Behavior, Penn National
Commission

FROM:   Neil Smelser

RE:     Looking toward the December meeting

        Colleagues, let me bring you up to date first.  On August 22 and
August 25, I sent out two memos, one on conceptual issues--namely on the
distinction between public and private and the nature of norms and
normative regulation--and one identifying some issues relating to the
conceptualizing of causes.

        Several of you responded, and all of you have received those
responses.  I can be brief in my summary of them:

        (a) Several of you found my remarks on the difficulty of defining
public and private in absolute terms convincing, but expressed uneasiness
about the possible implication that I was arguing against the
meaningfulness of such a distinction.  (I was not, incidentally, but was
observing that the distinction is a contingent, continuously negotiated
one rather than a constant, objective one).  Bob Wiebe expressed the hope
that we do not lose touch with a working distinction between private and
public.  Claude Steele asked that we focus on two salient aspects of
public behavior:  the decency-offensiveness dimension on the one hand and
on the other hand the civic responsibility, or the identification with and
commitment to publicly shared, collective goals.  (He perceived something
of a decline in both in recent decades.)  Edna Margalit also wished to
retain the distinction between public and private, however indistinct.
She suggested, moreover, that fostering "civility-related attitudes and
behavior" is fostered by, among other things, "euergetism" or
magnificence, which refers to different traditions of public-spirited
conspicuous giving.  In a related formulation, she argued that what
society does with its "surplus" is a measure of its commitment to the
civil good and its level of civilization.

        (b) In other comments, Martin Seligman argued that we should
distinguish between "remote" (e.g., economic explanations of specific
behaviors such as crime) and "proximal" explanations (more psychological)
factors.  Bob Wiebe argued that we should concentrate on behavior rather
than motivations, and reiterated an earlier fear of excessive
proscription, of imposing norms.  At the same time, I would argue, norms
and institutions remain something of a focus in talking about civility or
tolerance, and the Commission as a whole is interested in focusing on the
role of institutions.  I would like to develop some ideas about that role
in the remarks that follow, and perhaps move one step forward toward
thinking about what kinds of suggestions and recommendations our task
force and the commission might be able and willing to make.

*   *   *   *   *   *   *

        All of us acknowledge, in one way or another, that the causes and
conditions of different kinds and patterns of civil and uncivil and
individually-oriented and collectively-oriented behavior are numerous and
complex.  Seligman's distinction between "remote" and "proximal"
explanations express that, and my own identification of "cultural,
social-structural, and social-psychological forces" suggests the same
complexity.

        In this series of notes, I want to tackle this issue of
complexity, and suggest that a variety of conditions affecting the kinds
of public behaviors we are focusing on can be ranged in a kind of
"value-added" way, each contributing to civil/uncivil behavior and
tolerance/intolerance in our society.  By "value-added" I mean that each
range of factors contributes to the explanation (and thus constitutes a
legitimate basis for our attention), but that which is added is
qualitatively different in each case, and interacts with other ranges of
factors.  Furthermore, each class of factors I will identify can be ranged
in terms of "remoteness" or "immediacy", that is, generality or
specificity of determination.  In all cases I will concentrate on relevant
institutions or institutional arenas.  These past few sentences are on the
abstract side, and thus perhaps not very helpful, so let me move directly
to what I have in mind.

        (1) The first range of institutions are those which I would call
"dispositional" in character, and these institutions are those that affect
especially the formative years of persons, and create general orientations
toward conformity or nonconformity, selfishness or altruism, tolerance or
intolerance of ambiguity and difference.  I also believe that these
institutions play an important though not exclusive role in the genesis of
mental health and mental illness.  The institutions I have in mind are:

        The family, as it impinges on the developing child, from birth
                through adolescence;
        Education in the early years;
        Peer groups among the young;
        The representations put forward by the media;
        The "neighborhood" or "community," without being very precise in
                identifying these.

        It is in these institutions that individuals become "programmed"
in a dispositional way toward responding to others, toward playing or not
playing according to the rules of the game, toward accepting or not
accepting difference.  Role models are exceptionally important in these
arenas, though not unimportant in other settings as well.  The emerging
dispositions must be regarded as "remote" and nonspecific in explaining
adult behavior relating to civility/incivility and tolerance/intolerance,
because so many other ranges of causes and conditions intervene, but
nonetheless they "add their value" in a general way to that explanation.

        In assessing and evaluating these early and important
institutional settings, moreover, we can pose questions about their
viability, and a great deal of our public and scholarly discourse focuses
on the viability of the family (its stability, its pathologies), of
schools, of the media (especially television), and peer influences.  Of
the factors affecting that viability--cultural patterns, economic
deprivation, unemployment, migration, and rapid social change in
general--can also be numbered among the "causes," but, according to the
scheme I am putting forward, they must be regarded as even more remote,
and as operating through the institutions in question.

        Any "recommendations" we might be inclined to make with respect to
these dispositional institutions would have to do with their general
viability, and ways to improve their functioning.

        (2) The second range of institutions I have in mind I call
"engaging" institutions, and refer to those institutional arenas that
structure  the greatest part of adult social participation and social
responsibilities.  Among these institutions I would mention:

        The family again, though in its significance as membership group
                rather than agency of socialization
        The job/occupation/workplace complex
        Voluntary associations and communal groups (clubs, labor unions,
                ethnic associations)
        Informal friendship networks
        Collective leisure activity

If one adds up the cumulative structuring effects on the daily round of
individuals' life, these effects are enormous.  These are the institutions
that "lock" individuals into society, and constitute the major organizing
forces in their lives.  As such they operate as social controls over most
of the ways time is spent and how people behave toward one another.

        As "determinants" of civil/uncivil behavior or
tolerance/intolerance, these institutional engagements also have to be
considered remote, though that must be recognized as those settings in
which most behavior, both public and private, occurs.  We also assume that
if people's attachment to these institutional settings is tangential,
frustrating, alienating, or non-existent these effects can spill over into
the quality of people's behavior generally.

        (3) Institutional "opportunity structures" for expressing civil,
cooperative, or collectively-oriented behavior.  Here I am referring to
the institutions of civil society (voluntary associations, parties,
interest groups, and other politically significant organizations) and
political society proper, which refer to the more formal political
institutions (electoral arrangements, channels for political expression,
etc.  These settings do not refer to the motivations or incentives for
these kinds of behavior, but rather the opportunities to do so.  If these
institutions are, or are regarded as, non-functioning, unviable, or
meaningless, however, we can conclude that the probability of collectively
responsible behavior via them is reduced accordingly.

        (4) Normative controls proper.  This refers to that range of
formal and informal laws, rules, and expectations that prohibit or call
for certain types of behavior.  In an earlier memorandum I laid out
several dimensions along which these norms can be
arrayed--required-optional, specific-general, and prohibitive-positive.
The range of institutionalized norms and expectations can also be
ambiguous and/or contradictory, as various of the members of our task
force have noted.  In any event, the normative influences on whether
individual behavior is civil/uncivil or tolerant/intolerant or
collectively oriented or not present us with something of a paradox:  On
the one hand, they are the most proximate influence on these behaviors,
because they specify those behaviors and sanction them in various ways.
On the other hand, it is apparent that normative attempts to influence
behavior tend to be ineffectual and unenforceable unless the ranges of
influences outlined in (1)-(3) above have some viability.  Another way of
putting this is that most behavior, good or bad, is voluntary and operates
without direct and continuous normative intervention, and that normative
intervention is in some respects a court of last resort.  This point also
explains why recommendations and solutions of unwanted social behaviors
and problems are likely to be ineffectual in themselves, unless they fall
on a ground of other, more general conditions that facilitate and
encourage the behavior in question anyway.

        (5) Arenas for disputation, negotiation, enforcement, and change
of norms.  Here I have in mind institutions such as administrative
appeals, courts, and the continuous work of interpretation and application
of norms and expectations.  These arenas are major settings for the
realization of justice and equity in society, and they constitute a
setting for continuous "cultural work" in defining, interpreting, and
ultimately legitimizing norms and expectations.  They also "add their
value" to understanding the context in which norms and expectations might
be expected to be viable; put another way, these institutions can, if they
function properly, reduce the heavy-handedness and oppressiveness of rules
and norms mechanically applied.

        In concluding this communication, I offer two remarks.  The first
is to explain that I have attempted, by using the logic of "value-added,"
to sort out the different conditioning and causal influences on those
ranges of behavior with which we are concerned.  These conditions and
causes differ qualitatively from one another in their significance, and
they interact continuously with one another.  They also point to those
areas in which we might want to offer suggestions and recommendations, and
indicate that these suggestions and recommendations themselves will have
to lie at different levels of generality, scope, and significance.

        Second, I confess that I do not know whether or not my thinking is
on the right track or helpful, and that I am really serious in making that
confession.  In all events it is put forth as tentative and inviting input
on your part.  In developing this input, I hope that you will (a) be as
direct as you can and (b) be looking always at some kind of message we can
deliver to the commission as a whole at its December meeting.
