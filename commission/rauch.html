<p>


MARTIN MARTY:  Our third panelist is Bill Rauch, who is artistic director,
co-founder of
the Cornerstone Theater Company in Los Angeles.  He teaches at USC in
his non-onstage and backstage time.  He's taken his Harvard education
around the country--30 productions, 14 states, works with local
communities and relates to our theme today because one of their strong
accents is how to bring a sense of community, how to deal with
conflict.  Bill Rauch, please.
<p>
BILL RAUCH:  Thank you.  I'm so moved by the two presentations
that just happened, and I'm really honored to be here to be able to
talk to you all.  Thank you.  And I'm going to do a little slide show.
I'm representing an ensemble of 10 artists and administrators called
Cornerstone Theater Company. I'm going to tell about our company and lots
of stories,
and I hope that they'll spark some issues that relate to why
we're all here.  In 1986 we started with a goal of going to
communities that did not have a tradition of live theater.  And we
thought that we could give and we thought that we could learn a
tremendous amount if we did this.
<p>
And we started with communities that most obviously didn't have a
connection to live theater because they were geographically isolated.
So we worked in very small towns at first, like this town of 200
people in northwest Kansas.  And we would go into a community and put
the show on.  (Can you guys see around me?  No?  I don't know what to
do.  You can move if you want.  Oh, really?)  So we would transform
a community space.  (Should I do that and get out of the way?)  So, for
instance, this is the vacant gymnasium of a high school which we
transformed, as you can see. (I've got to take this.
It's all very complicated technically.  Oh, no, I'm OK)  We cast
local people in our pieces--community artists.  So, for instance, this
is "Three Sisters" from West Virginia.  The oldest sister was played by
a local coal miner's daughter.  The youngest sister was played by a
college student, and a member of our company played the middle sister.
<p>
We have auditions throughout the community for people of all
ages.  And we involve musicians as well as involving people backstage
in all aspects of the production.  All the community
collaborations we do are offered on a pay-what-you-can basis in terms
of admissions, and we leave behind some of that money for the
community to keep on doing theater.  So, for instance, this is a
tribal welding shop in Nevada that became the Walker River Little
Theater.
<p>
The shows are also almost always bilingual, sometimes trilingual.
This is a deaf actor, C.J.  Jones, who brings ASL into a lot of our
work.  We also try to reflect the community sometimes by producing
worksites specifically.  This is a piece called "Everyman in the
Mall," and death comes to Everyman while Everyman is shopping in Santa
Monica [in a]  shopping center.  Or sometimes the community might be
recreated on a stage.  For instance, we collaborated with communities
east of the Anacostia River in Washington, DC, and so this was
literally a street corner from Anacostia that was built on Arena Stage
when we did the show there.
<p>
Sometimes the plays that we're doing don't have enough
characters to really reflect the community, so we do choruses, like
Greek choruses.  These are the Canasta Tea Gals from Marfa, Texas.
They named themselves.  We also involve a lot of music in our
productions, and the shows often end with a full cast song.  This is
from a show we did about AIDS in Miami.  (Got some water.  Much better.)
<p>
Now I'm going to show you a bunch of images from specific shows
and talk a little bit about text.  This was in Marmarth, North Dakota,
a town of 190 people in the Badlands of North Dakota.  The play we
were doing was "Hamlet." And we began to really be challenged by our
community collaborators about how people didn't understand the play.
And it wasn't the fact that it was in verse; it wasn't the `thees' and
the `thous.' It was all the nouns and the verbs that didn't have any
meaning anymore.  And we thought, well, here we're talking this whole
party line about making the work accessible, and I would say, `Well,
if you get your footnote, you can look up that word.' So we actually
kind of jumped off an artistic cliff together.  We decided to rewrite
"Hamlet." And this was called the "Marmarth Hamlet."
<p>
And we were, after a week of rehearsal, a Sunday
School teacher came to me and said that he had to quit because of all
the bad language that we had put in the play.  But more upsetting than
the bad language was the bad language Shakespeare had, all the
blasphemy, because Hamlet constantly said the word 'God' in a
blasphemous way.  And so we had an emergency meeting of the town
Historical Society and sat around with a big table full of ranchers
and their wives and members of our company, and we discussed what the
purpose of theater was, and whether it was to reflect the way life
really was or an idealized version of the world, whether or not people
in Marmarth, North Dakota, swore.  And we all learned a lot from each
other, and the Sunday School teacher stayed in the play and it was great.
<p>
This is from "Tartuffe" in Kansas--we went to "Tartuffe" with an
agenda about doing this Moliere play about religious hypocrisy because
of all the televangelist scandals that were breaking out.  As
always, we learned from our community collaborators the big issue
in Norcatur, Kansas, was not the televangelist scandals, it was the
family farm crisis.  And actually, our version of "Tartuffe" became in
a sideways way about the fact that Tartuffe was taking over Orgon's
farm.
<p>
This is the Sherrs, Nevada.  It's the Walker River Paiute
reservation, and the material that we were dealing with there was "The
Oresteia" by Aeschylus.  And this was a local high school student who
was playing Electra, and it was very intense because everybody on the
reservation wanted to know were we going to
promote Christianity or traditional native spirituality with the
piece.  That was the big question.
<p>
For instance, the Christian minister on the reservation made
two of our cast members burn their eagle feathers while they were
rehearsing with us to renounce their evil ways.  And so
there was a lot of pressure from the community about how were we going
to go, and in the adaptation that we ended up doing with the
community, I think the best line was said by the character who
played Hawk, and she said, `Follow the old ways, my people, or follow
the new, but above all, respect them both, respect the balance.' And
everybody would nod in the audience at that point.  It was great.
<p>
"Romeo and Juliet" in Port Gibson, Mississippi; like way too many of
our communities in this country, the school system is kind of de facto
segregated.  All the African-American kids go to the public school,
and across the street is the private military academy where all the
white kids in the community go.  So it seemed like a very natural
place to do Romeo and Juliet.  The Capulets were played by white
actors and the Montagues were played by black actors.
<p>
We did workshops in all of the schools, and we dealt with the Queen
Mab speech from "Romeo and Juliet." And every single kid, every age,
every school, said the same thing:  Freddy Krueger is the one who
comes to you in your dreams.  It's Freddy Krueger.  So we adapted the
Queen Mab speech to be about Freddy Krueger, and it was really
extraordinary because the kids felt an incredible ownership of this
play.  There was a waiting list of 340 people trying to get in on
closing night.
<p>
Romeo was played by a high school senior, Edred Bernstein, who'd
failed his state literacy test twice and was about to not graduate;
instead, get a certificate of attendance.  We cast him as Romeo
because he was the best actor, and, of course, he learned his lines
faster than anybody else and it was brilliant.  And it was a
very intense time in Port Gibson for many reasons.  One is that the
play led to, after one of the performances, the first discussion in
the community about why the school system was segregated, and black
and white parents and kids really talking very honestly.  A little
white girl got up and asked her parents if she paid for her to go to
school so that she wouldn't have to be in school with black kids.  And
it was--I don't know what to say.  I'll stop there with that.
<p>
In 1991, we wanted to bridge between communities.  We'd done a lot of
bridging within communities, so we raised what was, for our company,
an insane amount of money and we hired 40 artists from all the
communities we'd worked with across the country.  So this is, for
instance, Edred, who played Romeo, Jessica Covasco from Marfa, Texas,
and Rod Pritchart from Marmarth, North Dakota.  And the play that we
did was an adaptation of "The Winter's Tale", called "The Winter's
Tale:  An Interstate Adventure." It was an outdoor show that
went on a 10,000-mile national tour back to everybody's hometown.  And
we closed on the Mall in front of the Capitol building.  And it was
very intense to be one of 52 diverse Americans standing on the Mall
doing this play about what it meant to be a citizen of this country.
<p>
In 19--how am I doing?  What time is it?
<p>
MARTY:  You're fine.
<p>
RAUCH:  Yeah?  In 1992, we moved to Los Angeles to begin a series
of urban residencies, and our first project was with the nation's
largest housing project for low-income senior citizens.  And it's a
very multilingual place.  Edyen, for instance, here only speaks
Mandarin Chinese, and Lisa Patah from Colombia only speaks Spanish.
And so we only had one choice, which is to have everybody speak in
their native tongues.  And so we
had all these fun devices; we had banners in all four languages;
there was also a Korean in the show that gave a couple sentence
plot synopses.  And then we also had this multilingual chorus to help
kind of explain what was going on, introducing a new character.
<p>
The second community we worked with in LA was Pacoima, a
geographically defined community, a lot of gang activity, and the play
was an original play by Migdalia Cruz, and the play was about the need
to listen to children, and it was horrifyingly prophetic because there
were two kids who were killed during the process.  One was a little
12-year-old girl who was killed at our performance at the Boys & Girls
Club a week before we opened, and we had a meeting of the cast, a
lot of them her friends and family, to discuss whether or not to go on
with the show.  And they felt that not only should we go on with the
show, but that we needed to dedicate it to her and to a young man
named Efraim Lopez, who also died during the process.
He'd been waving a broomstick in a threatening manner at a police
officer and was shot nine times.  And so the last line of the play,
was [spoken by] the character Edmundo, who was kind of based on
Efraim, and he came out with a broom sweeping up and he said, `A broom
can be a very dangerous weapon, especially when there's so much to
clean up around here.'<p>

Our third project in LA was with a community defined by culture and
language; it was Arab Americans citywide.  And again, just the lesson
of learning from the community.  There was such wild divergence within
the cast about how to cook a certain thing, about what a certain
wedding ritual was.  The diversity of opinions was out of control,
and so the cast decided with the playwright and the director to craft
their own rituals that were built of all these fragments of
everybody's own rituals from their native countries. <p>

In the summer of '94, we did our first LA bridge show, where we hired
people from the three communities that you just saw, and we did a play
about people living together in a courtyard apartment complex in
Los Angeles.  There was a great composer, David Markowitz, who did all
these original songs the full cast sang.  And this particular
one was called "The Communication Song." It had the full cast sang
verses in English, in Spanish and in Arabic.
<p>
And then our next to the last sequence of projects I'm going to show
you images of.  We were invited by community leaders from the community
of Watts to do a series of plays in the LA community of Watts.  A
tool that's become very common for us now is we built a community
advisory board of a lot of different folks from the community, and the
main thing was the community was really interested in bridging the
Latino and African-American communities within Watts.
<p>
We did our first show at the Watts Towers Art Center, a city-owned, as
neutral venue as you could find in the community of Watts, advertising
in Spanish as well as English, and we had only African-American
auditioners and only African-American participants in the show because
of where that venue was within the community.  Four blocks away was
San Miguel Parish Hall, the center of a Latino residential
neighborhood.  We commissioned a play called "Los Faustinos" in which
a Chicano family of seven makes a pact with Mephisto,  and in this
play--oh, I put this in for fun.  This was a scene where Governor Pete
Wilson came and had dinner with the Faustinos family and thanked the
audience for voting for Proposition 187.  It was a real highlight of
the show.  And at any rate, there were a few African-American
participants from the first show that became part of "Los Faustinos,"
even though, as they said, `This is the Spanish show.  Why don't you
cast us in this?'
<p>
Our third show was "Sid Arthur", an adaptation of Herman Hess'
"Siddartha." It
was done in an African-American church in Watts, but by now, a third of
the
cast was Latino, folks who had participated in "Los Faustinos."
And by the time we get to our fourth and final show in Watts, "The Central
Ave
Chalk Circle" an adaptation of Brecht's "Caucasian Chalk Circle," the show
really succeeded in bridging the community in such a full way that we were
very, very proud of, to the degree that this production recently won an
award;
I have to brag.  We have these local theater awards, the Ovation Awards,
and it won best production of the year; it beat out 190 other professional
productions.  This was a show in which 9/10ths of the cast were community
actors from Watts.  So that was a great moment.
<p>
And the last image is our most recent community collaboration, the
"Birthday"
show.  It was our 10th anniversary on June 30th, 1996.  We wanted to
celebrate
our birthday in a unique way.  We also wanted to find a way--and this
really
connects to a lot of the stuff we were just hearing about--to bring people
together across community lines.  So we put up the call that we wanted to
bring together people born on June 30th who lived in Southern California.
And
we got a great response, 200 people, from, really, all different walks of
life
in the community.  And we did this lovely show.  What was really
interesting was the reaction within the Cornerstone family, in terms of
our
board, our funders.  There were people who were deeply upset who felt that
it
was a sacrilege in terms of what the word `community' means.  Community is
your neighborhood; it's your ethnicity; it's any number of deeply held
things.
It is not the day you were born.  And they felt that it was a mockery.
<p>
There were other people who felt like this was the most important work
that
our theater company was put on this Earth to do and hoped we would do many
more projects like this.  So that's kind of where I will leave you on our
journey, tackling these issues.  And thank you.
