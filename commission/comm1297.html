Subject:     	race commission

Fellow commission members--

Yesterday's NYTimes (Nov 20) had a story that would seem to be the sort
of thing our commission could/should have a way of thinking about:

The John Hope Franklin-chaired advisory committee on race that the
President established in the summer held hearings at U of Maryland on
achieving diversity on college campuses and invited discussion only from
people who support affirmative action.

Is this right?

There is no doubt a practical rationale that such hearings could
degenerate into a debate on aff. action, which is of course only one
policy among many in an effort to create diversity in higher ed. Franklin
perhaps hoped to keep a political hot potato from hijacking potentially
productive hearings.

On the other hand, the commission is supposedly going to arrive at some
sort of comprehensive statement and policy proposals on race in America:
why should we listen to a commission that systematically chose not to
listen to a whole lot of thoughtful people who conscientiously think
we'll do better at arriving at a just society without aff. action? Is
this a model of civil discourse?

Professor Franklin's specific comment in the Times that Ward Connerly
probably could not contribute to the discussion of how to make the
university more diverse seems to me wrong-headed. Franklin may be right,
but the fact is that the passage of Prop 209 has been stimulating some
new thinking and new proposals about how diversity might be assured
WITHOUT affirmative action, and some of that thinking is being done
very seriously by people who share Connerly's views on aff. action.

There's another angle here, of course, too: what's the media's angle on
this? It's pretty obvious that the reader is supposed to respond to the
story as I have -- to see it as an outrage, albeit a minor one. I think
it is pretty hard to read the story without believing that the
commission goofed (at best) or, for those less generous, revealed plain
as day that they've essentially already written their report and the
hearings, etc are just providing them appropriate citations and footnotes.

Did the media goof?

Is this the sort of thing on which our commission might offer any
guidance?

Michael -

        i think the advisory committee  goofed; i think the press may have
overstepped in assigning motives to Franklin and the committee, but am
not confident of this judgment; i think the matter would be a good
illustrative case for the commission to look at.

One thought: We might consider calling for the repeal of the independent

criminal allegations, and damages public discussion by increasing the
of scandal-mongering without doing much if any good. This is a
controversial view, though, I know.

To:    Fellow commission members
From:   Jay Rosen


I think Michael is right that the Clinton Race panel probably erred by not
giving voice to affirmative action opponents. But he is even more right
that this would be something interesting to take up, if we could explode
the terms of the debate about the decision and include the media's
performance in our review and comment.  Here are some questions that occur
to me as good ones for us to contemplate:

1.) What model of fact-finding, inquiry or public debate was Franklin
using when he made his decision?  He must have had something in his mind
beyond denying Ward Connerly a voice because Connerly disagrees with him. 
What was it? 

2.) Was that model made clear in Franklin's comments on the decision and
the news media's treatment of it?

3.) What model of inquiry or imagined form for debate beyond a predictable
"let's hear from both sides" might have applied here?  In other words, if
we believe that Franklin goofed, do we believe so because we accept the
notion that a clash of the committed, courtroom-style, is the best way to
bring forward a useful discussion?  Or would we have included voices like
Connerly's for some other reason?

4.) Like this for example:  Beyond their opposition to affirmative action,
do the people who style themselves as opponents of such policy have
interesting things to say on race and its discontents, which is, after
all, the Commission's charge?  Did Franklin consider what their
contribution on the larger questions might be?  Did the news media?  Did
Connerly?  And why was Connerly's name *the* name, anyway?  People oppose
affirmative action for all sorts of reasons, don't they? 

5.) Which model of public discourse does the news media habitually display
when it reports on controversies of this type?  Note that the press has a
double role here: first, it views the Franklin decision--indeed, all the
work of the Commission-- through whatever lenses it has for reporting on
initiatives like the Clinton effort on race; then, when something like the
Franklin decision happens, it views the ensuing controvery through the
lenses it has for such "controvery" stories.  In some ways it makes the
controversy by reporting on it.  Both sets of lenses make contributions to
the climate of discussion, but are they the best contributions possible?
What others might we recommend?

All of these are, I think, pertinent questions for us to consider.

Subject:      	Re: race commission

I would be very reluctant to have the Commission discuss and pass
judgement on Franklin's decision per se.  I think that to do so would
reenforce what I take to be the harshest criticism of the Penn Commission,
i.e., that we seek to separate procedure from substance and, in so doing,
are pursuing a covert substantive agenda (altho I guess in this case it
would not be exactly the agenda which the most vocal of these critics
think is at issue).  In any case, I think it would tend to sound like we
oppose affirmative action, which i am not prepared to do. 

On the other hand, I think we might profitably discuss affirmative action
and talk both about the substance and the procedures through which this
policy has, and is, evolving.  With the possible exception of family
values, I think it is the issue which most strains the civility of public
discourse.  I personally am quite confused about it and would welcome the
opportunity to think it through. 

I also think that the discussion would lead into a lot of the other issues
which are causing strain in the society.  For example, the last time I
heard a discussion of affirmative action -- a talk last week at MIT-- the
position of the speaker was that affirmative action had served its purpose
by creating the black middle class and that now we needed to focus on the
under class.  But I think that the black under class is closely connected
to the displacement of black workers by new immigrants (as well as white
youth and 'retired workers') in lowing paying jobs at the bottom of the
labor market, and hence any solution to that problem is going to involve
something which looks very much like affirmative action opening jobs now
held by immigrants to blacks.  We will then face very directly the issue
of having become a multi-racial society without having come to terms with
the legacy of our biracial history. 

At any rate, affirmative action raises at least three distinct questions:
1. The philosophical question about the meaning and value of equal
opportunity and equal treatment.
2. The practical question of the policies required to pursue these values.
3. The question of how we debate and discuss these issues.
I think these distinctions are useful conceptually but I would not want to
segregate them in separate discussions.

I think that what Michael Piore says about our not going after the
Franklin Committee and the value in addressing an issue like Affirmative
action specifically makes a great deal of sense. I am not sure where we go
from that, but it is worth examining our own ability to answer the three

Subject: 	public inquiry

A further thought on the e-mail discussion about the Clinton commission on
race: at the same time that the commission decided not to hear from
opponents of affirmative action, the Piscataway School Board decided to
settle Sharron Taxman's suit and so keep this case from being argued
before the Supreme Court. Strategic considerations led civil rights groups
to pay the School Board to settle -- because this was a case that even
many ardent supporters of affirmative action believed to be an abuse of
the idea of affirmative action, and therefore absolutely the wrong case to
be the basis for some definitive new ruling on the constitutionality of
aff. action programs. 

But why was this the wrong case to fairly test aff action? What would the
right case be? Are there some instances of what gets called aff. action
that almost everyone would agree with? And others that large majorities
would disagree with? Can we figure out what principles or sentiments
underlie those agreements and disagreements? In retrospect, our discussion
with Christopher Edley was not terribly illuminating. What are the
different forums in which to talk about race/diversity/affirmative action
(the race commission, the courtroom, our own commission) and what might
make them work better? 

(And pardon me if these questions have already been answered by several of
my commission colleagues in works I have not yet read. I'm spouting off
here on the news of the day, not on a topic in which I am well versed.)

I share entirely Michael Schudson's reaction to the diversity commission's
exclusion of affirmative action opponents.  In fact, this may be a way
for us to distinguish ourselves from the White House efforts even while
pursuing similar goals.  Given the outcome in the Piscataway case, we need
to engage the various positions, not run from them.  Perhaps this makes
the "inclusive process" role of our commission even a bigger part of its
purpose.

As to Cass Sunstein's thought that we should recommend repeal of the
Independent Counsel statue (a position I share), that may be too far
afield and could well be misunderstood.

I'll be in attendance.

From: 		MSandel@latte.harvard.edu (Michael Sandel)
Subject: 	Re: public inquiry

I would like to endorse Michael Schudson's suggestion that we take up the
refusal of the Clinton commission on race to hear opponents of affirmative
action.  Since most of us favor affirmative action, we can address this
issue as a question about democratic public discourse without appearing to
be promoting our views on affirmative action itself.

It would also enable us to discuss a general issue that we have neglected
so far:  Should democratic political discourse and deliberation be more
like a conversation or more like a debate?  Some of the language of our
project so far has assumed that the ideal is "conversation."  But I think
we should question this assumption.  

"Conversations" can be civil and decorous, but lacking in genuine
political import.  The best conversations (at dinner parties, for example)
are not purposive in the sense of aiming at a goal or destination.  Unlike
political deliberation, they are not oriented to significant action.  This
is why the conservative political philosopher Michael Oakeshott favored
"conversation" as the proper mode of political discourse.  It avoided the
politics of contending purposes and ideological contestation that he, as a
traditionalist, wanted to avoid. He understood that "conversations" do not
challenge existing arrangements.

In his own way, John Hope Franklin expressed a similar thought when, in an
interview in today's BOSTON GLOBE, he said he wanted conversation and
dialog, but not debate, about race.  Were we to take up this case, as I
think we should, we could use it to prompt discussion about whether
democratic political discourse should be more conversational or more
argumentative.

I have been an enthralled - and silent - listener to our various
commission e mail debates over the past few months -

The latest focus on the John Hope Franklin debate  has, however, rekindled
some of my confusion about the hoped-for end product of the Commission and
how best to focus our energy.

I keep returning to the question of what the success of the Commission
would look like - i.e. if we succeeded what would have changed ?  Where
would we see the difference?  And what would the difference be ? In our
streets, in our schools, in our media ? Our legislation ? 

Do we yet have a vision of the difference we want to make ?

Let's imagine the success of the Commission - and how we would know it -
and then we can work back from there in terms of strategy. 

And maybe that will help us decide more clearly if we want to focus and
shape the John Franklin debate.........

Looking forward to seeing you all next week,

Subject:      	Re: race commission

Might it be possible for us to consider the issue of a thoughtful but
mildly snappy quarterly, an issue that was briefly raised last time? Any
risk of drift, or lack of focus, could, I think, be much reduced with a
near-future publication, around which some of our thinking might be
concretized, and which might even air internal uncertainties or
disagreements (e.g., about the race commission and affirmative action). My
speculation/hope is that a quarterly could provide a set of useful public
documents (maybe with some data, e.g. from Kathleen Hall Jamieson) and
also enable us to make some progress in some of the periods without
meetings;  and it should be easy to do this, since many of our members
have been thinking or even writing on these topics. Would something like
this make sense?

Subject:      	Re: successful outcomes

To:  Commission Colleagues
From: Jay Rosen

I want to add my sentiments to Tom Bender and Mari Fitzduff's call to
think about what a successful outcome of our work might be. 

Some initial thoughts:  I believe we can be most successful in the realm
of "imagination" as against "recommendation."  That's not to say that we
won't have some things to recommend, only that we should think of
"success" as broadening the field of the possible within a public culture
that too often and too quickly closes down possibility by falling into
predictable ruts. 

For example, Michael Sandel reminds us that "debate" has uses that mere
"discussion" cannot meet.  I believe he is right.  But why is debate so
frequently imagined as a two-sided affair, as if pro and con, conservative
and liberal, supporters and opponents are the only creatures who walk the
earth?  If we can bring to life other models of debate beyond the unending
two-ness we greet in politics, the news media and the so-called culture
wars, then we might make a contribution in all three spheres.  What other
models are there that move beyond a reductive two-ness?  Surely we have
enough talent and learning in our ranks to tackle that problem. 

Second:  In our initial meeting, we all rushed to assure ourselves that
"civility" is not not the best way of framing the concerns that created
the Commission.  We were reacting--quite correctly--to the common
assumption that to be civil is to be "nice," polite, bloodless in
argument, eager to smooth over conflict, etc. 

It was an intelligent move on our part to dispense with this
sentimentalized version of civility.  But an imaginative move on our part
would be to reclaim a more vigorous notion of what it means to be civil. 
To conceive of a civility stripped of sentimentality and imagine what it
would look like in a variety of public settings seems to me a challenge
worthy of this Commission. Civility as a ethic of openness to both
conflict and communication might be one way of re-working the term.  I am
sure we can think of others and move backwards from there to what the
public consequences of each might be. 

Something similar might be done with the troublesome term "diversity."  In
the United States, at least, diversity is typically equated with ethnic,
gender, racial and, occasionally, ideological differences.  But these
cannot be the only relevant meanings in those cases where being "diverse" 
is considered a social good.  What are some others?  Here's one that
springs to mind: temporal diversity.  Meaning, there are some voices who
speak from within a temporal frame stretching across the current political
season.  Others want to punctuate current conflict by beginning hundreds
of years back.  Still others have their eye on the future, but they may
mean next week, next year, or the next several decades. 

Think of it:  Can the President's race commission succeed without an
infusion of temporal diversity?  This may not be the best example of an
alternative frame, but, again, I am confident that we can imagine better
ones.  A diverse debate that included a mix of the committed and the
ambivalent would be quite different than a debate diversified only from
*within* the committed.  Were we to diversify diversity (so to speak) we
would be contributing our imaginations to a public culture that often sees
this laudable goal too narrowly-- and thereby improverishes itself. 

Here's another challenge to our imaginations: the public uses of expertise
and the styles of expertise our public culture promotes.  Typically, to be
an expert is to command technical skills and claim authority over certain
spheres of knowledge.  But is this the only kind of expert we have, the
only kind we need?  It takes only to a moment to imagine others: for
example, someone who is expert in making space for others to claim their
own authority.  The expert who knows how to pose the best questions,
rather than the one who, commanding the relevant knowledge, has arrived at
the "right" answers.  The expert in what Donald Schon calls
"problem-setting"  as against problem-solving.  Were we to imagine
alternative forms of expertise and their various uses, we might succeed in
clearing space for a more creative use of intelligence, understood more
broadly and assumed to be broadly distributed in the population. 

So in thinking about what success would mean for the Commission, we might
start with imagination as a guide to what we can best contribute.  If we
re-imagine what debate, civility, diversity and expertise could mean in an
improved and revitalized public culture, we'll be on our way to making a
difference and making good use of our different talents and starting
points.  Of course, these are only four possibilities where imagination
might be brought to bear; and they may not be the right ones.  But in our
collective wisdom we can probably find  better ones.

A final thought, borrowed from the critic Irving Howe.  Howe was an
admirer of utopian thought, although he understood as well as anyone the
dangers of utopian engineering.  After admitting all warnings about the
historical damage done by utopians of one stripe or another; after
assimilating the wisdom of, say, an Isiah Berlin, who issued such warnings
throughout his life, we can still, I think, glean something from Howe's
remark that one virtue of utopian thinking--or public dreaming--is that it
releases us from the "provincialism of the immediate."  That's what
success for this Commission looks like to me. 

And what does it look like to you?

Subject:      	Re: race commission

I can't make it to the Washington meeting, which overlaps with the last
session of a team taught seminar, but wanted to respond briefly to some
points raised by Schudson, Sunstein, and Sandel.

The report on the Franklin commission did look odd and interesting to me
too; it seems a little small to react to as a symptomatic phenomenon,
unless it proves (as it may) of a piece with the whole conduct of that
"conversation": still, it looks like the sort of thing we should want to
address. What are some other issues on which corporate bodies charged with
public responsibility have talked themselves into believing that there is
really only one point of view?

And doesn't Michael Sandel almost share Franklin's premise when he says,
"Since most of us believe in affirmative action"? I assume many of us, at
least, believe that something good will be lost if we lose affirmative
action entirely any time soon; and that something good has been lost all
along by our dependence on affirmative action as a form of bureaucratrized
race patronage. It is a means of advancing one kind of equality, at the
sacrifice of another kind. And it draws a color line. Randall Kennedy has
made these arguments better than I can; and he doesn't start by saying,
"Since most of us agree..." Incidentally, Michael Oakeshott didn't say,
anywhere that I know of, that conversation is the proper mode of political
discourse. He used the word "conversation" in a very specialized context
to mean a discussion between persons living and dead, with interests
familiar to each other, whose aim is not a search for truth and whose
end need not be linked to utility (see "The Voice of Poetry in the
Conversation of Mankind"). The use of "conversation" as a soft synonym
for debate--therapeutic debate, from which real disagreement is eliminated
at the outset--we owe I'm afraid not to conversative political theorists
but to T-group facilitators and focus-group politicians like the current
President.

I think Cass Sunstein's suggestion of a journal makes sense; it would be
something concrete anyway, and might lead to some considered statements,
and some not too decorous conversations. His other suggestion about the
abolition of the independent prosecutor seems a proposal to be taken up
separately, by those of us inclined to agree with him, at a moment when
attacks on that position will not come across as vulnerably partisan.

Subject:      	three thoughts

All preliminary, hence in the form of questions:

1. Could we create a forum--a reader-friendly journal (as Cass suggested,
paper and/or on-line?) might be just right--that would say some things
worth saying about responsible deliberation, citizenship, and leadership
AND at the same time model responsible deliberation? 

2. Would it be best if the forum explicitly does not expect the Commission
members to agree on controversial issues, any more than a decent
deliberative democracy should expect citizens and political leaders to
agree with one another? (This is one reason why I think a reader-friendly
journal is better than a Commission report.) 

3. Could the various subgroups each contribute to the forum (e.g. to each
issue of the journal) at least one illuminating example, none of which
claims to be THE focus of all our work or all that matters to contemporary
democracy, but each of which illustrates some important issue to which at
least two Commission members have something to say to one another, to
other members of the Commission, and to a much larger, thoughtful
audience? 

I look forward to our meeting on Monday.

Best,

        I want to second Amy's third point, that each of the
subgroups be encouraged to submit to the "journal." If we go in this
direction, the journal will need a "launch" which distinguishes its level
and the prestige of its contributors from the great mass of stuff on the
web. With careful handling, it could become a Daedelus or American
Scholar of the web.

Subject:      	Social Contracts

Another tentative, half-baked, suggestion, addressing the question
what a successful end-product might look like:
      A series of new Social Contracts.
*    The classical social contracts are thought of as being (a) between
citizens and sovereign; (b) between employers and employees.
What we might be thinking of is the delineation of a series of new
ones: between the politicians and the media; between academe
and business; between old-timers and new-comers/immigrants. Etc.
*    This is, I believe, a mission well worth pursuing. It is also a
mission our Commission is particularly well positioned to pursue.

For what it's worth, I agree entirely with David Bromwich on the value of
waiting in re independent counsel; to do this right now would get a lot of
publicity, maybe, but it's far too politicized. On the journal, an
attractive possibility is to have *both* a hard copy and an Internet
version. It would be possible to generate an inexpensive, nice-looking
hard copy journal -- a quarterly might well make best sense for us -- and
also Tom Bender has a good suggestion in proposing a defined time period
for the journal, e.g., 2 years, 3 years, 5 years. -- We also have an
obvious subtitle (The Journal of the Penn National Commission on Society,
Culture and Community) if not an obvious title. --

Subject: 	many thanks and a suggestion

Returning to Evanston I found this wonderful exchange in progress.  Maybe
we are finally on our way.  Above all, thanks to Michael Schudson for
stirring us.  The chair of the leadership group exemplifying leadership of
the best kind. 

Is there a growing agreement that imagining an ideal outcome for the
commission's work holds the greatest promise right now?  If so, let's act
on it.  If the three chairs agree, it would be relatively easy to
substitute a simply stated agenda, working group by working group, that
wcould facilitate Monday morning discussions to this end.  We don't need
to overarticulate the branches and subbranches of a discussion we haven't
even had--as, it seems to me, the agenda we were mailed threatens to do. 

With three excellent chairs to keep the discussion moving, we only require
brief preliminary guidance, an A, B, C to give us general direction and
boundaries.  One chair, Joyce Appleby, chimed in her agreement with
imagining right away.  Michael Schudson hasn't said anything at odds with
such a goal.  Where is Neil Smelser on the subject? 

Allowing the three working groups to address the same basic issue from
three perspectives gives space for many points of view within a common
objective.  Even as we talk within our group, we will be talking--or
preparing to talk--with everybody else.  Small-group discussion at the
beginning should give our plenary discussions considerably greater
direction.

The other proposal that drew support, a possible journal, would be
subsumed in these Mon. discussions.  Depending on the outcome we imagine
and consequently our hopes about whom to reach and what to accomplish, a
journal might be just what we want to create.  Or it might not.  In any
case, the three chairs would make certain we didn't lose track of such a
promising idea. 

Any attempt to prepare a commission position on John Hope Franklin's
decision strikes me as a guaranteed disaster.  I line up behind Michael
Piore.  Discussing it, on the other hand, should help us envisage our
model outcome, as the e-mail exchange illustrates so well. 
Parenthetically, my guess is that Franklin was trying to preempt a
takeover, a swamping of the committee's work by waves of opposition
delegations who would have transformed it into a platform against a
fictitious affirmative-action policy.  (See Amy Gutmann's recent
publications for a stimulating discussion of the subject--I wish we had
the appropriate chapter from DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY in our reading
packet.)  Although Franklin handled it badly, anyone who in full public
view has tried to find a practical middleground between open expression
and purposeful committee work knows the seriousness of the problem. 

And special thanks to Mari Fitzduff for repeating her plea of last June.
I do very much hope to be talking about our imagined outcomes Mon. AM.

From: 		David Bromwich <david.bromwich@YALE.EDU>
Subject:      	"conversation"

Today's New York Times contains a story on the President's "town meeting"
on race, conducted yesterday in Akron, Ohio. I quote an interesting
passage:

        With the meeting long past its 90-minute time limit, Mr. Clinton
asked those who opposed affirmative action to raise their hands, and a
handful on stage did so. Then he strolled across the red carpet to tower
over Dr. [Abigail] Thernstrom, who is co-author of "America in Black and
White: One Nation, Indivisible," an optimistic portrait of race relations.
        "Abigail, do you favor the United States Army abolishing the
affirmative action program that produced Colin Powell?" he asked
pleasantly. "Yes or No?"
        As the audience tittered, Dr. Thernstrom, surely unused to being
publicly challenged by the President of the United States, questioned
whether General Powell succeeded  because of what she called racial
preferences. But Mr. Clinton interrupted her, asking again whether she
would endorse abolishing the Army's affirmative action program.
        "Yes or no?" he repeated.

        Admittedly I have to rely on the story, not having seen the event
on television, but something struck me very wrong about this. And maybe it
relates to a point that Professor Jamieson and I were making in different
ways, several months ago in Philadelphia, about the inversion of roles
between leadership and constituency, and the way this is increasingly
reflected in the manners of public discussion.

        In a democratic society we suppose that a citizen in a crisis has
the right to "grill" a person in command--to cross-examine, and to look
closely into the adequacy of a leader's use of authority. But in what
kind of society do we imagine a leader grilling one of his constituents
as an example of errant civic attitudes--and this on a public stage, where
what is sought is public mortification? It sounds like that was what was
happening in Akron. It was said by Whitman, a greater democrat than any
president we have had, that in the Old World the people bow to show their
respect for kings and queens, whereas in America the president takes off
his hat to the people. How, then, did we come to a President saying to
a citizen as he towers over her in a public conversation, "Yes or no?"

        Maybe too, the trouble has to do with a confusion of leadership
and constituency that is apt to get into the very idea of conversation,
when this is a device set up and audited by a government. It is set up
initially as a means to test the air, to draw in opinions, to know what
people's presuppositions are. But then, the government knows in advance
the outcome it would prefer, and so is tempted (how could it not be?) to
step into the conversation and steer it a little. But when it does that,
from what attitude should it speak? At once as leader (the President
called for the questions and acted as MC), and as mere constituent (i.e.
familiar friend to "Abigail"). I actually think the first-naming in this
case betrayed the doubleness of motive--being at once folksy-intimate and
intrusive; bringing her in alongside him, and cutting her down to size.

        I am starting to wonder on the lines of Schudson, Sandel, et al.,
about the universal credence accorded to "conversation" as a therapeutic
corrective to the common abuses of public speech and public discussion.
It may be quieter. Is it really more searching, more civilized, more
reflective of what decent manners in public exchange ought to look like?

From: 		James Fishkin <fishkin@MAIL.UTEXAS.EDU>
Subject:      	Clinton town meeting on race

        I have followed the discussion stimulated by Michael Schudson with
avid interest. Now, I think the actual first event in the Clinton race
initiative adds some further twists to the issue. 
        1. A critic was included, Abigail Thernstrom, but she was in a
setting, and used in a context, where any genuine dialogue was impossible. 
        2. The event was structured to create the impression of real
dialogue. It was an impression that was stage managed and designed for
sound bites on the evening news. The techniques of campaigning were
employed for persuasion of the audience at home. The practice of real
dialogue would be impossible in such a setting. 
        3. Why? Many reasons. I will list only the most obvious. Hundreds
of people in a room cannot have an effective dialogue without some further
preparations. Small group discussions would have been necessary. A method
of giving people access to further information would have helped. There
are many misimpressions and myths on the race issue. Good information
could have defused some of the hot button issues. To have the President,
who is a partisan, moderate the event cuts out opposing views. I thought
his question to Thernstrom was unfair--"Abigail, do you favor the Army
abolishing the Affirmative Action program that produced Colin Powell, yes
or no? " The President insisted on a yes or no answer. And the President
also asked for a show of hands from the audience on Affirmative Action as
well. Such an exchange produced sound bites and headlines. It made the
papers and the evening news. It was not a genuine dialogue. Furthermore,
who were the people in the room? They were a handpicked audience of some
sort. No explanation was offered. What inferences are we to draw from a
show of hands? Who do they represent? What views did they come in with? 
How representative of the city or the country were they? With the
President putting all his charm and prestige behind one alternative, and
ordinary citizens not having any preparation in small group discussions,
how likely is it that a show of hands would give us a picture of public
opinion, or a picture of public opinion as it would develop with citizens
who were really discussing the issue? 
        4.I am not saying that the event was useless. The effect of many
soundbites and headlines would lead to the impression of an important
issue. The President certainly came across as concerned and engaged. He is
very effective in this format. The President's advisers were probably
pleased. However a great deal more could be produced by initiatives
structured in other ways. I obviously have some views about this. However,
other commission members would, I am sure, have other thoughts. I would
like to suggest that we put this issue on our agenda. How could one have a
more serious and effective initiative to create a serious public dialogue
about race (or for that matter, other issues on the public agenda, say
social security?) A public dialogue is more than a stage managed town
meeting where a public figure responds to questions. A public dialogue is
a genuine deliberation among the people--all the people, under conditions
where they come to some better mutual understanding, and some better
understanding of the issues and where they can come to considered
judgments on that issue. 

        I'd be very interested in further responses, either by email or in
our meeting. Jim Fishkin

Subject:      	Re: Clinton town meeting on race

I second/third the motion to put the issue of how to
convene/promote genuine public conversation about race on our
agenda. The use of a critic of affirmative action as a prop, and
the way national politicians who despite good intentions are
still using the conversation to score political points, are
obvious places from which to launch of critique of Clinton's race
intiative. But I would hope that our effort is not mere critique.
What would be extraordinarily helpful in my view is for us to
engage in a constructive investigation of what works, not just
what entertains. Toward this end, the Center for Living Democracy
in Brattleboro, Vermont and Study Circles Resource Center in
Pomfret, Conn. have done hands on experimentation with several of
the formats commission participants mention (small group
preparation, reading material, sustained conversation over time,
etc). Rather than just theorize about the issue, I would hope we
could benefit from those who are doing and not just those who are
thinking. I should include in the category of doers Jim Fishkin's
project as well. Lani Guinier

I have been much interested in the discussion of the past several weeks
and in the proposal for a journal.  As I think about this periodical,
though, I find myself wondering exactly whom we envision as its audience
and how that fits with our responses to Mari's questions about what
weimagine for the Commission. Isn't there data that suggests people tend
to read only what they agree with in the first place?  Would a journal of
civility preach to the converted?  Who is it that we want to engage?  And
what audience would such a journal reach?  Drew Faust

From: 		Amy Gutmann <agutmann@PRINCETON.EDU>
Subject:      	From Form to Substance

Moving from form (journal) to substance (race relations): the issue of
race relations is certainly one that this Commission could do well to
address more and better than we have (or anyone else has) as yet, both
because it is an important issue in its own right and also one that
reflects a more general problem of how this society can and should deal
with deep disagreements. 

On the question about conversation v. debate, I doubt that a fully
adequate way of dealing with deep disagreements in politics is either
conversation or debate. 

1.Conversation does not adequately come to terms with the high stakes of
politics, that laws and public policies (unlike most academic seminars) 
significantly affect the lives of many people. Citizens therefore have far
more than an intellectual interest in the outcomes of a conversation on
race, for example. Whereas conversations typically do not aim for, result
in, any decision, politics typically does. Maintaining the status quo is
every bit as much of an outcome in politics as enacting a new law or
policy;  lives will be just as affected by doing nothing different about
race in this country as by doing something different. So an ongoing
conversation can be at best a prologue to action; at worst, it can be a
distraction from action. 

2. Recommending debate as a reaction to the inadequacy of conversation
raises another, similarly troubling problem. The merit of debate is that
it recognizes that there are high stakes in discussing issues such as race
in a political context. Debaters are (appropriately enough) focused on
outcomes, but they also are typically precommitted to fighting--whatever
the merits of the opposition--for diametrically opposed outcomes. (The way
debates are typically conceived and structured, concessions are considered
losses.  Whereas in democratic politics, where one's opponents will be
bound by the outcomes, concessions on the merits should be encouraged.) On
most issues, such as race, creative new ways of moving forward--which
often are ways that synthesize the merits of opposing positions-- may be
needed, and certainly should not be precluded at the outset of the debate.
In addition, concessions to the genuine insights of opposing sides can be
constructive, and productive of conceiving a better understanding of a
common good.  Because debate typically does not entail arguing in a way
aimed at producing a better outcome than any of the debaters conceived
from the start, it too is limited as a model for democratic citizens and
leaders alike. Debate at best heightens awareness of the stakes; at worst,
it exacerbates existing animosities and misunderstandings and foresakes a
search for a better way of living together before it even had a chance to
begin. 

3. What about deliberating in a way that (unlike conversation) is
outcome-oriented decision-oriented but (unlike debate) is open to more
synthetic and mutually respectful ways of moving forward?  Is it even
possible, let alone desirable, to deliberate in this way about deeply
divisive issues such as race? Aren't people's minds just made up already? 
There is good evidence (some of it provided by Commission members) that
the views of citizens continue to change in reaction to both political
leadership and moral argument. This suggests that there is more work still
to be done here, including work possibly by the Commission.

Subject:      	recent flurry of e-mail conversation

I have been very gratified by the the great burst of e-mail exchanges
recently--stirred mainly by Michael Schudson's query on the race
commission--because earlier I had despaired that it was not drawing out
enough conversation among us.  I haven't chimed in up to this point
because I didn't develop any reactions that I thought were articulate
enough to put forward.  I'll say a couple of things today, responding
mainly to Bob Wiebe's suggestion for a common starting point for all three
working groups at are meeting.

I think that the myriad of issues that arise in connetion with the
national discussion and conflict over affirmative action should and will
enter our deliberations, but I don't think that issue should dominate.
Certainly it would be counterproductive if not fatal for the commission to
spend its time taking substantive positions on the issue because that
would divide us internally and make us just another actor in the partisan
fray.  Certainly we should exploit the procedural and "process" issues
that are exemplified in that debate, but our vision should be more
comprehensive.

With respect to agenda-setting, I know that all three groups will be
inclined to remember the recent e-mail exchanges and that the ideas will
find their way into their discussions.  I am somewhat concerned about
homogonizing the agendas too much, however, because the three different
perspectives of the working groups do not relate equally comfortably to a
single issue.  My own group, interested in the cultural contexts of public
behavior, might have something to say about issues of civility in public
conflicts, but our mission seems much broader than that, at least the way
we have been treating it up to now.

I think there are two perils in the work of a commission of the sort that
the Penn Commission is. The first peril is being so diffused that nothing
is accomplished; ;the second is being so focussed that comprehensive
issues are not raised.  I think that the first peril was evident in the
early part of our work, and that we may now moving in the direction of the
second.  I would think that intermediate equilibrium point would be the
best.

Subject:      	Re: From Form to Substance

Amy's formulation (of trying to model or foster an outcome
oriented deliberation that is synthetic and respectful) is very
helpful to me in thinking about the debate/conversation
distinction. I wonder Amy if you would take a friendly amendment
as follows: we need to consider an ongoing and mutually
respectful format for deliberation that is oriented to solving a
problem and that does not lock participants in advance to
defending a specific, single and fixed solution. On the other
hand, I like the word conversation because the word deliberation
seems static and formal to me. I concur that "There is good
evidence (some of it provided by Commission members) that the
views of citizens continue to change in reaction to both
political leadership and moral argument." I would add something
that came up in our June meeting -- citizens' views also change
as a result of a "transformative" experience -- one that engages
them in multi-dimensional ways. Jurors report that their
deliberations are often significant and memorable. So it is
possible for people to engage in the way that both Christopher
Edley and others described in the context of religious or
spiritual experiences through deliberation. I have also seen
evidence of personal growth and collective "epiphanies" in
student brainstorming/collaboration sessions that I described at
our December 1996 meeting. Perhaps this is another way in which
the Commission could, as Tom Bender, said, get us to become "a
public"-- get citizens and not just policy makers or politicians
to work together, ie deliberate or collaborate about public
policy issues, such as but not limited to race. Lani Guinier
