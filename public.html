   <p><td><FONT SIZE="+1">Leading public figures consider the state of public discourse and public behavior--as well as the causes and 
  effects of social fragmentation, cultural conflict, and uncivil discourse--in the United States. These essays speak to urgent and 
  perennial questions about the nature of American society, the responsibilities of leaders, the rules of democracy, and the role of 
  public culture in times of crisis, conflict, and rapid change. Public Discourse in America originated in the work of the Penn 
  National Commission on Society, Culture, and Community.</FONT></A></P></TD></tr> </table>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">From its inception in December 1996 to its
  concluding meeting in November 1999, the Penn National Commission
  on Society, Culture and Community sought to understand the problems
  of contemporary public discussion and behavior and to foster
  more engaged and thoughtful conversations about contemporary
  social issues.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">During the Commission's inaugural session,
  its chair and convenor, University of Pennsylvania President<A
  HREF="http://www.upenn.edu/president/rodin/index.html"> Dr. Judith
  Rodin</A>, challenged <A HREF="members.html">48 scholars, political
  leaders and shapers of public opinion </A>&quot;to address the
  polarization, oversimplification, and isolation from important
  cultural and intellectual traditions that are increasingly characteristic
  of contemporary social and political discourse.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">When the 'study' phase of the Commission's work completed, 
    the Commission operated in its 'programmatic' phase as the <A HREF="http://www.upenn.edu/publictalk">Penn 
    Public Talk Project.</A> <A HREF="sps.html">Dr. Stephen Steinberg</A>, the 
    Commission's executive director, and his staff spearheaded a national 
    effort to improve the practice of robust public discourse, or <I>public talk,</I> in 
    ways that led to stronger, more inclusive communities.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">The <A HREF="http://www.upenn.edu/">University
  of Pennsylvania's</A> educational philosophy, dating to the principles
  of its founder, Benjamin Franklin, links the theoretical and
  the practical and makes the Penn National Commission and the
  Penn Public Talk Project natural extensions of the University's
  core identity. The work of the Commission and the Public Talk
  Project expresses Penn's fundamental commitment to academic excellence,
  technological innovation in research and communications, and
  the importance of bringing academic and professional resources
  to bear on urgent social problems.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><a name="work"></a><IMG SRC="images/work.gif" alt="Work" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Between December 1996 and November 1999, Commission members 
    deliberated over the course of six thematically linked, semi-annual plenary 
    meetings that took place in Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los 
    Angeles.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Early in its discussions, the Commission identified
  three deficiences that influence public behavior: a<B> Failure
  of Leadership,</B> in the continuing dialogue between and among
  leaders and constituencies; the<B> Fragmentation of Communities</B>,
  in which race, class, ideology, ethnicity, and special interests
  divide and sub-divide rather than unify civic life; and a <B>Culture
  of Intolerance,</B> expressed in the incivility, intolerance,
  and ideological polarization that dominate our public discourse.
  Commission members examined these problems through three working
  groups: Culture and Public Behavior, Leadership in a Democratic
  Society, and 21st Century Community.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Commission members' contributions at the plenary
  sessions and through the working groups allowed the Penn National
  Commission to commission research, papers and presentations that
  examined the current state of discourse and its relationship
  to contemporary society and culture. These materials:</FONT></P>

    subcommunities into a larger society or bridge barriers of hostility
