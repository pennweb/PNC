<img src=aboutpublictalk.gif> <p><b> Public Talk:  The Online Journal of
Discourse Leadership</b>, features original work by PNC members, staff and
commissioned research reports.  Each article is linked to a discussion
area specific to its topic.  The links (using online conferencing
software) enable the general public, along with the Commission members,
Fellows, Community/Campus Network members, and staff, to discuss the
Commission's work.  The discussion area is searchable and permanent
(unlike a listserv or newsgroup), which enhances its usefulness as an
analytical and educational tool.

The Penn National Commission seeks to foster the "reasoned and reasonable" 
discourse essential to the social, political, cultural, and community life
of a democracy. An international group of forty-eight scholars, political
leaders, and shapers of public opinion, convened by University of
Pennsylvania President Judith Rodin, the Commission is meeting over a
three-year period to understand the problems of contemporary public
discussion and behavior and foster a more engaged and thoughtful public
discourse in the 21st century.
