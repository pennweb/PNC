MICHAEL USEEM:  Thank you.  I'm Mike Useem.  I'm on the faculty of the
Wharton School University of Pennsylvania, and I have the privilege of
welcoming Dr. Barry Munitz here to our commission.  We are, of
course, here in part because he is the president and chief executive
of the Getty Center.  So I just want to thank him here at the outset
for this fabulous opportunity to be in an absolutely fabulous setting.
<p>
And by way of introducing him and his topic, I'm going to just quote a
line from the white paper that Judy Rodin and Steve Steinberg had
sent around before we came together for this particular meeting.
They say �putting together the commission's emerging thinking, after
several meetings of this kind in previous months, that we should� -- and
I'm quoting here--"We should seek--we should seek to improve public
discourse by mobilizing social institutions to build strong discourse
communities across boundaries of difference--across boundaries of
difference."
<p>
Now I think experience reveals, certainly research shows, that people
who have crossed those kinds of boundaries are exceptionally good at
leading that kind of discourse.  Just to pick an example a little bit
far afield here, but to illustrate the point, I think some of you have
followed the career of Lou Gerstner, who's now the chief executive of
IBM.  He's always worked in the private sector but in very diverse
settings.  He began as a consultant with McKinsey & Company, a big
strategy consulting firm, worked for a piece with American Express,
financial institution; then worked at RJR Nabisco, which, of course,
is food and tobacco; and since 1992 has been chief executive of IBM.
Can't think of three institutions more different than American
Express, RJR Nabisco and IBM.  And I can't think of a more difficult
institution to come into at the time he did.  IBM, 1992, was losing an
enormous amount of money.  But I think the record does confirm that
it's the experience of working different institutions that
helped him rethink what IBM was, what it stood for and where it should
be going.  There's, I think, an argument in his story to say that
crossing these kinds of boundaries is a way to improve our thinking
and certainly our discourse.
<p>
And today we have a person who I think not only has he crossed those
boundaries as a participant, but has led several different kinds of
institutions and is probably exceeded by few in a capacity to think
about what it means to lead institutions and the discourse that go
with them of very different kinds.  Barry Munitz has a PhD in
comparative literature from Princeton University.  He served for a
period as chancellor of the University of Houston, the main campus;
served as chief operating officer of Federated Development Company in
the private sector; served as chancellor of the California
State University system with, just to put a couple numbers on that, 23
campuses, 37,000 staff and faculty, 300,000 students and a budget of
$4 billion.  He served as chair of the American Council of Education,
and now really celebrating his first year in office here.  And, of
course, this is just now a little past the first year of celebration
of the opening of the Getty Center.
<p>
He's coming here today to talk with us about the following topic.  I'm
just going to tell you the theme.  And by the way, we're going to
work this about 45 minutes.  He will speak for about 20 minutes.
It'll give us time for maybe 20 minutes of going back and forth.  And
then we'll look to push back onto schedule.  But Dr. Barry Munitz's
topic will be the role of institutions in leading civic discourse.  So
join me in thanking...
<p>
BARRY MUNITZ:  Thank you.  I'm very pleased to be here and to
welcome you all.  I was just explaining to the people at my table it's
like this every day, 365 days a year, but the fact is you all have to
leave when you're supposed to leave.  Several people have volunteered
to just stay permanently, and as much as some of us would enjoy having
you do that, there are others who are waiting now at the tram stop to
move in.
<p>
Now I'm going to talk informally a--at lunch, and please, this
is--Judith and I and others in this room make a living talking while
everybody else is eating and so we are well used to this, and they'll
come back and forth with dessert, coffee and whatever else you need.
<p>
I want also not to deliver a speech to you but to make a few
remarks about this question of public discourse and bridging
institutions, based primarily on my own experience here in this first
year and in going from a very large public institution to a relatively
small private institution and the lessons learned not just from one to
the other but in trying to pull the two of them together.  And, also,
as some of you know and as I'll refer to briefly in a minute, I've had
additional sort of intriguing bridge building responsibility since the
first Tuesday of November, chairing the governor-elect's transition
team.  And this is the first time in California in 16 years that we've
had a Democratic governor, and since that Democratic
governor was Jerry Brown, it's really about 25 years since we really
had a Democratic governor.
<p>
And--and so--but as--as Neil and others can tell you, it's
really--it's truer than funny because if--I mean, Jerry Brown never
gave any thought to infrastructure or to party, and so
your--there really is this very long backlog.  And unlike Washington,
Sacramento is not a place where people look forward to hanging out in
think tanks and consulting firms and law firms and waiting for the
parties to change, and so we really, from a number of different
angles, are starting virtually from scratch.
<p>
So it's been intriguing, and as you'll--and I'll read to you in a
second the--when I finish a quote that I just got this morning that'll
give you some sense of what my life is like, to see what the reaction
has been in California to having the head of the Getty Trust, this
small private, elitist, starkly non-partisan institution have its
chief executive officer share the gubernatorial transition team in the
name of facilitating public discourse.  So I just want to make
some comments pragmatically about what this means.  I know a number of
the people in this room and Joel and Neil and others who've been
mentors and counselors and guides to me for 25 years--in Neil's case,
almost 30--and the chance to talk a bit about the reality rather than
the theory of this bridge building, and my concerns basically come in
the category of governing boards, leadership, communities and the
media.  Because I confess to you from the outset when I even saw my
assignment, I don't know what public discourse is, I mean, other than
perhaps the literal description of a lot of people in public
discoursing taught illogically in the sense, although that's
important, and many times they don't.
<p>
But it's talked about in this setting and this agenda as if there's
some profoundly clear and insightful definition of public discourse
that removes it from the normal categories of human verbal
interaction.  And I don't know how to distinguish those two, but I'm
sure all of you do, and by the end of the day today I will also know.
<p>
The Getty is an interesting combination of institutions, and it's what
makes the public discourse so intriguing because we are, at the same
time, a wonderfully spectacular art museum focusing on the visual
arts.  We've just passed two million visitors in exactly 12 months
open, about a little less than twice the number that was predicted
would come.  For those of you who've spent any time in Southern
California, the really interesting number is half of those people did
not get here by driving their own car, and therefore our entire
planning process to control people, which was based on the fact that
no one in Southern California would attempt to get here other than
driving their own car, was completely out the window from scratch.
And little things like the assumption that the way we would understand
our audience was having wonderfully sophisticated, demographic
analysis when you called to reserve to park your own car therefore
means that about half the people coming here we really have no earthly
idea where they came from, who they are.
<p>
We know they're coming back.  We know they're staying longer than most
people stay at museums by a considerable factor.  And for this group,
what's interesting is we know an awful lot of them are coming and not
going to the museum, so that they are coming up to the--the building
behind you in that corner is the Harold Williams Auditorium, which
includes the world's only Richard Meier-designed podium, as well as a
whole bunch of other things on the site which are the world's only
Richard Meier-designed �blank,' but has about 450 seats of a wonderful
setting where people are coming for lectures, for concerts.  We
had--last Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, we were the West
Coast venue in a partnership that we undertook with the 92nd Street Y
to perform the Robert Pinsky translation of Dante's "Inferno." So for
those of you --several of you grinned when they mentioned that
my degree was in comparative literature so that you could see where
we are having an insidious influence here.
<p>
But people are coming to walk through the gardens, to look at the
site, to eat meals, and most of them, but by far not all of them, are
going through the museum.  And many of them are coming for meetings
like this, and we are overwhelmed with requests to use the site.  It's
only our friendship, not long and strong, but molded together by the
fact that Deborah Marrow, who runs our grant program and many of you
know is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and a very loyal,
supportive and persuasive one, is the fact that you have broken most
of the rules that we have for whether or not we allow groups to come
into here, aided and abetted by Jill Murphy and Joel, who've been
conspiring about public discourse and community service for some time.
So between Jill and Deborah, you're here.
<p>
But what's interesting about that is we could have meetings like this
here every day, and we have a whole bunch of people who are willing to
pay a substantial amount of money to have meetings like this here
every day.  And it's leading to a very interesting conversation about
our board table about what an appropriate use of the site is and
whether it's appropriate to even diversify our revenue stream by using
the fact that this--I'll defer to some of you in the audience who've
spent a life writing about economic institutions, but this may be one
of the few places in the history of American capitalism where you have
an extreme excess of demand oversupply, and there's not a damn thing
you can do about it.
<p>
So the two traditional things you do, which is increase your
price--and we don't have one--or increase your productivity, and our
problem in the first place is that we have too much of this product
out there, has created a very interesting squeeze.  And one of the
places where the board and we are more and more intrigued as to the
potential, therefore, of this combination of museum and public site
and auditorium and gardens and research institute and conservation
setting and academic institutions devoted to education and the arts
and the intersection of information, technology and the arts is that
on top of all of that, we have a $5 billion endowment.  The
endowment--there's $1.2 billion of Getty cash in this project, 13
years in the building, and the endowment was larger when they cut the
ribbon than when they put a shovel in the ground.
<p>
Now, I mean, that's a blessing.  It's really a tribute to Harold
Williams' great leadership.  It's a tribute to the bull market, and
those of you in this audience, as I've said, and other settings who
know me at all would have known that the day I was appointed to this
job, you should have immediately sold any equities you were holding in
your retirement portfolio, since the story of my life is going after
people who've had a wonderful time when the market is going up and
then trying to untrack, as I did in 1991 when I arrived.  And the Cal
State University board said, `We think the state may be headed for
some economic difficulty,' and then announced that there was a $14
billion deficit in the budget.
<p>
So now we are talking about how we used that endowment portfolio to
undergird these different types of institutions, but on the other hand
how we diversify our revenue streams so that we're not resting on just
one source, how we can leverage it so that we can help many other arts
institutions and how we can be certain that, when inevitable gyrations
occur, there's some protection for these programs.  And more and more,
what the board has said about that is find partners, leverage
resources and get much more involved in the shaping of cultural policy
and advocacy.
<p>
Now what's interesting here in this sort of anecdotal part of the
building bridges between institutions in the name of public discourse
is this--the first Munitz theorem.  Governing boards that encourage
you in theory to leap out into the public arena and shape and drive
public discussion find great discomfort, in fact, when you do so.  Because
it's wonderful in theory to debate X number of issues, but
when you actually then choose one or more of them and then engage
publicly in talking about them and someone, amazingly enough,
determines that that might not have been the right topic or the right
perspective, the very same people who encouraged you to get out there
on their behalf and lift the general quality of public interaction are
interested in talking to you about being a lot more cautious and a lot
more slow-moving and realizing that this is a private and not a public
institution.
<p>
This gets compounded, with all due respect to the media people in the
audience, by the fact--and I'm sure this will come as an extraordinary
surprise to everybody in this room--but, by and large, the public
media in California is a lot more interested in bad news than good
news and, therefore, whenever there is a stor--so take a live example.
The story of the Getty wants to diversify its revenue stream in order
to be much more active in the shaping of cultural policy, the
establishment of public policy advocacy positions and the enhancement
of shared resources--so that, for example, Mrs.  Clinton was here and
we jointly announced a Getty-White House millennium project on
natio--saving America's treasures and national conservation that
Deborah helped shape.  What the Los Angeles Times is interested in is
solely whether or not there's any arts organization in town that might
feel threatened by the fact that we're talking about diversifying our
revenue stream.  And amazingly enough, they actually found one or more
people who were -- and weren't reluctant to say so.
<p>
And so the reality is--and--and I love her and she's here and so it's
easy for me to say, but the fact is the press, by and large, in my
judgment, either doesn't know how to and/or doesn't have much interest
in reporting the quality of public discourse and the complexity of the
exchange that occurs when one attempts to engage, and, therefore, it's
twice as risky because the solution is either to say nothing at all or
to attempt to say something and to build some bridges, knowing full
well that you're fighting an extraordinarily steep climb upward in
attempting to have public discourse via the main method of public
interpretation, and this entire group could come up today with
spectacular insights, but there's not a damn thing you can do
collectively about whether or not 99 percent of the population
understood what you were doing and what you were up to.  You depend on
the transforming, communicating, translating vehicle.
<p>
And even in the arts world, I was amazed--I--I got this job a year ago
and was--the person who was happiest that I was coming was the person
that most people thought would be least happy that I was coming, who
was John Walsh, who was the head of the museum.
Everybody-- again, the popular anecdotal notion was that we were
headed toward this great conflict, whereas anybody who knew how smart
John was should have realized in a millisecond the joy he would feel
at the arrival of a pure Philistine.  I mean, there was
a--there--there was--there was no way on earth that I was going to be
threatening to John Walsh in any fundamental decision about the museum
other than the important long run, which is how much money he had to
spenal treasures?  I'm specifically thinking--I work in
East St.  Louis...
<p>
MUNITZ:  Right.
<p>
REARDON:  ...and, of course, we have the great Catherine Dunn of--her
museum...
<p>
MUNITZ:  Right.
<p>
REARDON:  ...and her life's work there.  That would be something that
we would be very...
<p>
MUNITZ:  Yeah.  It's been a terrific response.  And again--I
mean, the genius of what we did--I can use that word because it was
Deborah and her team and not me--but what we did was we made a $1.1
million grant to Dick Moe at the National Trust to partner up with the
millennium-White House project through Ellen Lovell and Mrs.  Clinton,
and the scheme is that they will take the $1.1 million and use it in
basically average--What?--about $50,000 increments...
<p>
Unidentified Woman:  Yeah, up to.
<p>
MUNITZ:  ...up to $50,000 as a match for local communities that
will raise the same amount and identify their sites, not mandated by
us, [but by] them.  But that local communities would come in.  We would
have
the incentive.  You'd know it was in place.  And the advantage for
us--and this is the glory of being here, and I promise you there are
many besides the sight and the weather--is that we also, having the
conservation institute, can provide the technical expertise, the
science labs.  I mean, it's a perfect example of Getty.  Another one
that Ted and Jill have been working on and that I really have
enjoyed that, again, we cooked up with Dick Riley was here and then I
described to Mrs.  Clinton over the summer--we have a partnership
between Getty, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Department of
Education and the Jet Propulsion Lab to have a contest next year for
school kids whose winners will give the most refined definitions of
the habitat on Mars in the year 2020, having to reflect a
sophisticated awareness of both the cultural and the scientific
conditions that will prevail.  What's the ballet in zero gravity?
<p>
And those--that kind of synergy and collaboration and partnering and
leveraging is what intrigues us and keeps us going.  And the response
has been terrific, and it was fascinating because, again, when this
first came up, some of the reaction of some of our board members was
that this was an elaborate scheme on my part to rescue a president
who's an old good friend, and it was very interesting to have to
explain how separate those two events were, and we have one or two who
still aren't convinced.  Yeah, Neil.
<p>
NEIL SMELSER:  I think we've talked on a couple of occasions about
what--what
I think is a shared perception on our part about the changing quality
of administrative leaders in higher education, by increasing the
proportion of what? -- shopkeepers, damage controllers, keeping the
constituencies happy by semi-promises that were never quite--quite
kept and a--diminishing numbers of visionaries.
<p>
MUNITZ:  Yeah.
<p>
SMELSER:  Now I think that you've probably given us some insight as to
why that might be.  The press is certainly a part of it.
<p>
MUNITZ:  Right.
<p>
SMELSER:  The increasing complexity of
constituencies is a very big part of it.
<p>
MUNITZ:  Correct.
<p>
SMELSER:  Because if you take one vision, you've got five people saying
that's the wrong vision...
<p>
MUNITZ:  Yeah.
<p>
SMELSER:  ...so why even have one vision...
<p>
MUNITZ:  Right.
<p>
SMELSER:  ...when you're going to make five enemies per vision?  And
these are--these are--it's a structural thing that...
<p>
MUNITZ:  Plus, you can't learn--I mean, what other--here--if you
were interested--if you were, Jill Murphy--I mean, if you were someone
in your 20s who was brilliant and experienced way beyond your years
and you thought in your life between 35 and 55 you would like a run at
being a college and university president, there are two things you
would never, ever do:  One, tell anyone else, and two, do anything
public about trying to learn how to do it.  Now what other profession
in the universe works under those conditions?  And then we wonder why
college and university presidents are--and the average tenure at the
AAU is falling below five years, and those are the most attractive
presidencies out of 3,500.
<p>
So we make the profession an amateurish one.  We have search and
evaluation processes that make it more and more difficult to--to dream
any dream out loud, much less try to deliver that.  We saddle them
with constituencies inside that are basically trying to examine
whether or not they've done something wrong, not whether or not
they've done something good to support--never letting--saying
something publicly good about it, and then we give them governing
boards, particularly in the private sector, that are fundamentally
looking at the fund-raising issue and are, therefore, examining them
by criteria that didn't get them there in the first place, or in the
public sector who've been chosen by political governors pushing their
own agenda.  I--I don't know why we're surprised--to me, the surprise
is that the Judith Rodins of the world are still there doing the job
and fighting the battle.
<p>
SMELSER:  Is there any way or anything you can say about
reversing that, what seems to have been an inevitable trend?
<p>
MUNITZ:  Yeah.  Well, everybody's trying.  I mean, Jerry Belile's
chaired a wonderful commission--Harold Williams served on it--for the
Association of Governing Boards that Kellogg and others founded, both
strengthening the academic presidencies that made what I thought were
some courageous recommendations because they were addressed, in part,
to their own constituency and governing boards.  My worry is, like
many things in this society, Neil, that it doesn't fundamentally
approach changing until it has a nervous breakdown.  And it's like
being a psychotherapist and hoping your patient has a collapse so you
stop worrying about the elementary neurosis and psychosis and you get
onto rebuilding.  Now--and that's a terrifying thought.
<p>
And the--I had this exchange-- some of you know John Vasconcellos,
who's a longtime--now in the state Senate, but for many, many years
was in the state Assembly, chaired the budget committee.  He's been
thoughtful about higher education.  And we were talking about this,
and he said to me, `Barry, the people of America only started caring
about the Vietnam War when middle-class white kids started getting
hurt.' And it--and it was an interesting comment.  And the link, Neil,
was this notion of--that you have to tiptoe up to the precipice of
disaster in this country to get people's attention in this complex
infrastructure issue.  And so you get to this bizarre situation of
praying it gets worse so enough people will care enough to make a
fundamental change.  And that's very scary.
<p>
Unidentified Man:  But what's the change?  What's the fundamental
change?
<p>
MUNITZ:  I think the fundamental change has to be a conspiracy
between governing boards, the selectors of governing boards and the
preparers of college and university presidents and museum directors
and symphony directors that treats the profession like a profession,
acknowledges the legitimacy of trying to get better at it,
acknowledges the reality of the conditions that prevail when you take
it on, and acknowledges that the only way it continues to get stronger
is that the way you get and teach the board members is to have some
buffer between the politics and the fund raising, on the one hand, and
the reality of a selection process, whether it's a screening mechanism
the way the ABA can be useful in Supreme Court selections or a
different mechanism.
<p>
I think the fundamental change is to realize that leading the
non-profit sector is a serious profession that will only get better if
the board members who choose and have to protect those leaders
understand what they're doing and that if you seriously then want them
to engage in quality life-enhancing public discourse, they are going
to get into trouble in the traditional sense of trouble and are going
to need support and protection, not find themselves out so quickly on
such a fragile wire that the slightest nudge brings you the next
victim.
<p>
OK.  Well, let me then--yeah, you're right on time.  I'll get you
going.  Enjoy the rest of the day.
