Celebrating the Conversation:  Public Discourse in Action Tape 3,
Session 2
<p>
Mr. LARRY LESSICK:  OK, we're going to start.  Welcome to our
afternoon session, which is on the subject of cyberspace communities.
I'm Larry Lessick and, with most of you for the last three years, have
been a member of this commission.  And anxiously been waiting and
eager to bring this topic to your attention.
<p>
We have in the room--I wanted to make sure everybody realizes--a class
here.  Mitchell Marcus and Dave Farber's class, which is doing the
impact of information technology on society, is with us to participate
in this conversation.
<p>
But we're going to have a conversation of the following form.  I've
got three people here, I'll introduce in a minute, who are going to
tell us a relatively short version of their cut on the issue we're
going to talk about, and then open it up for a conversation.  And
here's the way I want to introduce this conversation.  I know, from
watching the conversation we've had for the last three years, most of
you are deeply skeptical that there's any reason to use the word
community and cyberspace in the same sentence.  And most of you
believe that this is, you know, a lot of hype, bunch of kids--we got
20 more up in the back here--believe in.  But, really, when you talk
about what's essential, and the idea of community, it has nothing to
do with cyberspace.
<p>
And I've been anxious about how to bring this topic to you because I'm
not yet sure how I break you of that thought because, in fact, there
is such a thing as communities exis--existing in cyberspace in all the
relevant senses that you would identify as relevant for a community.
There are places where people spend an extraordinary amount of time
devoted to communal goods, to bringing about things that are of value
to a collection of people, where they feel identified and feel like
they have a role and responsibility in shaping that space.  There are
extraordinary collections of people who work in common on problems
that they consider their problems and problems of society in general.
There are these places you would recognize as communities.
<p>
But all of cyberspace is not that.  Cyberspace is not automatically a
community.  And the theme that we want to bring out in this
conversation is the extremely delicate relationship that exists
between particular architectures or designs of cyberspace and the
communities that they bring out, because some places in cyberspace
will have no recognizable features that you would call a community.
And, in fact, that's probably what you think of most of cyberspace:
e-mail or the Web or chat places.  These are not places we're going to
try to convince you are community spaces.  But there are other places
that really do function as communities.
<p>
Dave Farber runs a discu--a--a--a mailing list that constitutes a
group of people that really do function, in an important sense, as a
community.  And each of our three speakers today have a different type
of community they want to talk about.  So let me introduce them to
you.
<p>
The first is author Julian Dibbell, who's written what is, in this
world, a foundational text, very short, which makes it easy to be a
foundational text, about cyberspace, this article which you have
called A Rape in Cyberspace.  And Julian's going to talk about a
particular kind of community that exists in something called a MUD,
and he will do a really good job of explaining what that is and how it
works.
<p>
Marc Ewing is the chief technology officer of a company called Red
Hat.  Now Red Hat is a company which facilitates the--the distribution
and advancement of an operating system called Linux.  And Linux is an
operating system that is the product of something called the open
source software movement.  And the open source software movement is
one of the most dramatic instances of collective construction that we
have ever seen.  It is an extraordinary example of a kind of community
mind that has been enabled to do something extraordinarily productive.
And he's going to tell you a little bit about what made that possible,
what made it work.
<p>
And Ken Deutsch might be a little bit of the dark side of the story
we're going to tell here.  Kenny is the first full-time
political--Internet political cam--campaigning consultant.  Since
1993, his job has been:  How do we take the technology and
architecture of cyberspace and use it for politics?  And he's going to
tell you a little bit about how the technology plugs into what we
think of as more traditional efforts to mobilize communities or to
facilitate interaction politics.
<p>
OK.  So here's the way I want to work it.  I want to mix--they're
going to each talk for a relatively short time, I'm hoping no more
than 15 minutes, and I'm going to make sure that they've said what I
think it's important that they say.  So I'll pretend to ask questions
if they haven't really covered what I think you have to see.  And then
after the cycle of it, then we open it up for questions, and then--and
then towards the end, we'd also like to invite people from
the--students to participate in questions as well.  So let me start
with Julian.
<p>
Mr. JULIAN DIBBELL (Author):  OK, yeah, as--as Larry said, I'm going
to try to do a--a proof-of-concept or existence proof here of the
phenomenon of community online.  For those of you who are only
familiar with--with e-mail or chat rooms or Web sites or other--the
kinds of transient sites, locations on the Internet that have become
to--have--that have come to predominate, the community I've written
about, not just in this brief foundational text, but in a--in a book
that emerged from it is a place called Lambda MOO.
<p>
And it's a MOO, M-O-O, and MOO is a kind of MUD, M-U-D, which stands
for multi-user dungeon.  And to give the very simple technical
description of a MUD, it's a chat room with furniture, but that
is--that is too simple of way of describing it.  It is a text-based
chat system.  You log on and you--it is presented to you as an
architectural space.  So you log on and you see a description of, for
instance, a lecture hall with whatever textual descriptions and
elaborations the author wants to put in.  And you will see a list of
names also; so and so is here, Dufast is here, Joe Fleischman is here,
Neil Smeltzer is here.  And you'll see--and if you click on their
names or if you type the commands to access those names, you'll see
the descriptions that they have given themselves in text.  So already,
you have a rich sort of contextualization, you know, before you begin
to interact with these people.  And, you know, rich is relative here,
but--and that's--that's not the end of it.
<p>
The fact is, in a place like Lambda MOO, there is an intensity of
involvement that you just do not see in a chat room or in any kind of
online site with pretense--any pretenses to community that I've ever
seen.  People will spend up to 30, 40, 50, and in ex--extreme and
disturbing cases, 70 hours a week hanging out in this place.  They
will spend not only intense bursts of time over a short period, but
there are people there who have been there by the time I was there,
which was in 1993, '94, people who had been there for years and who
are still there now, I guess.  You know, people who have been coming
back to this place regularly for five, six, seven years now.
<p>
Why do they do this?  Well, one of the main things that involves
people in Lambda MOO is that they are able to help create the
architecture of the space.  This is not a given space.  It is given
when you first arrive, but there is the possibility to add on to it.
You can build your own room.  You can build public rooms.  You can
program strange kinds of objects.  The programming environment is
entirely open to manipulation by the--the players, as they're called.
So you can get involved on that level, you know, building cool toys
that people want to use, building systems for new kinds of discourse,
in fact.  This is above all a discursive community and I'll get to
that in a bit.  You know, different kinds of ways of interacting with
other people online can be built by anybody who comes along and wants
to build them.  And, of course, you can build new rooms and build--add
on to the back yard of Lambda MOO, which now stretches on for miles
all the way to the Pacific Ocean and has underground passageways and,
you know, alternate realities built into it; tiny snow globes that if
you shake them, you go in through the looking glass, and you know,
appear in an alternate reality.  So the environment itself is rich and
gets richer all the time with all of the involvement.
<p>
But there's also even more--you know, there's even a greater gravity
in the social interactions.  People--people develop friendships and
because there is a return, people keep coming back.  These friendships
deepen.  They're not just, you know, the one-night chat room stands
or, you know, the arguments that you get in with somebody on a--a
mailing list.  They're the full range of conversation that goes on in
a friendship or an enmity, as the case may be, because not only is
this a discursive community, it is a very political community as I
will also get to in a bit.  But there are--and there are also lots of
ways to play with the kinds of social interactions that you have
online because you can shift your gender, as it is presented in this
environment, because you can adopt different personae.  You can have
kinds of interactions with people that are shaped by those--by those
interventions on your part.  So there is already, as there is in
any--in--in a lot of MUDs, this broad range of behavioral
possibilities that have to do with shaping the environment and have to
do with the interactions that you have with other people on the level
of friendship.
<p>
And then at Lambda MOO, what happened is there is a whole other arena
in which to get involved and to keep you coming back and that is the
political.  And the way that that came about is the subject of the
story that's in your packets, and then I'll just review here a little
bit.  The story is called, A Rape in Cyberspace, and it's about an
incident that happened in April of 1993 at Lambda MOO in the living
room of Lambda MOO.
<p>
Lambda MOO is described as a sprawling mansion in the hills of Palo
Alto, and it's--it's gotten very sprawling over the years.  But
because architecture is really the governing metaphor here, the sense
of community is very tied to architecture.  And where the sense of
community was greatest, at least at this period of time in the history
of Lambda MOO, was the living room.  It makes sense.  The living room
is where everybody hangs out.  It's also where you first--when you
first arrive in Lambda MOO, when you log on, you pop into the coat
closet and you burst out of the coat closet and you're in the living
room.  And everybody's there and so there's usually a big party going
on.
<p>
So it's--it's sort of they symbolic core of the community, which
contextualizes what--what happened next, which was that a bunch of
people, old timers from Lambda MOO, were hanging out in the living
room and a character who called himself Mr. Bungle and described
himself as an obese, dirty, slovenly clown of various evil intents,
proved that he did, in fact, have evil intents by taking a devise that
another programmer had written called a voodoo doll.  And a voodoo
doll is, in most context in Lambda MOO, it's sort of like a--a party
trick, you know.  It's something you use to make your friend appear as
if they're doing something stupid, you know, because part of the
convention of interaction in Lambda MOO is that every time you
interact with somebody--you cannot--you see, you can't--you don't just
speak with people as in a chat room, you can also do what is called
emoting and that's--you--you perform actions.  This is--and for those
of you who have studied speech act theory, this is--this is wonderful,
you know, rich territory to get into.  You've got--it's--Lambda MOO is
like nothing but performative utterance all over the place.  And so
you can interact with people either by saying, you know, `I say this,'
you make a direct statement.  So--so my lecture here, for instance,
translated into the interface of the MOO would be--you will be seeing,
`Julian Dibbell says, "My lecture here translates into the language of
the MOO."' And then you would also see, `Julian Dibbell, you know,
fiddles with his hands in a attempt to add expression to his
statements.' So there's--there's--there's that two--those two levels
of things.  But--but what--what unites them both is that my name, my
character name is always prepended to the action or the statement.
And that's part of the conventions of the MOO is that whenever you see
a statement that's--that begins with somebody's name, you know that
that is something they have done.
<p>
And the voodoo doll is a trick that subverts this and somehow enables
another person to make a statement that's prepended with your name,
and there's a little tag at the end that says--and you hear so and so
laugh--laughing evilly in the distance to let you know who actually
played this trick on you.  But it's actually--while in most contexts,
it's used as kind of a joking game that you play on your friends,
because of the nature of identity in the MOO, the way that identity is
defined by this convention, it really kind of gets at you.  It can
kind of get--you feel as if someone has gotten under your skin and
into your body.
<p>
And what this Mr. Bungle did with this voodoo doll was basically to
enact what the community decided to call a rape.  He had various
characters in the living room performing violent sexual acts on
themselves and on each other, and he kept at it.  And they screamed at
him.  They told him to get out of here.  Cut it out.  He kept at it.
They transported him, there are various ways to pick people up and
throw them across the room and out of the--out of the building.  They
transported him out of the living room.  He kept it up long distance.
Somehow he had some way of making the voodoo doll work by a remote
control.  And eventually someone in ch--someone of a higher order--the
wizards who are in charge of maintaining the--the database.  The
wizard came along and--and locked him up in a special cage that
stopped him from doing this.  And there was a great outrage in the
community about this.
<p>
And very often when I have discussions about this story, as--as I
have, It's been anthologized and--you know, so it becomes a thing that
classes read and, you know, I'm often invited to--to talk to the
classes.  This is usually where the discussion stops because we get
into:  Well, was it really a rape and, you know, why didn't they just
turn off their screens and, you know, why did they have to get
outraged by it?  And I think that it's--it's--it is a very interesting
discussion, and there are very interesting things to say both
critiquing the idea that they characterize this as a rape and
responded to it at that level of gravity in some ways.  And, on the
other hand, very interesting cases to be made for why that language
was appropriate; you know, why--how identity works in this setting
and--and the extent to which that really was a violation.
<p>
But it makes me a little sad when the discussion stops there, because
to me, what--what was even more interesting was what happened
afterwards, which was that this discussion, this outrage, which
started on one of the local mailing lists--not only is there direct
interaction with people in Lambda MOO, but there are in-house mailing
lists.  So when you log on, there's--you'll see not only a description
of the room, you'll also see, well, you've got mail.  And you can
check out, you know, what the discussion is on the mail--on the
mailing lists.  And in this forum, there was just an expression of
outrage--you know, Mr. Bungle did this last night.  I'm pissed off
about it, so forth--that gradually evolved into a--you know, we put up
with this sexual harassment online all the time, and especially in
this setting, it's constant.  What are we going to do about this?  How
are we going to respond to Mr. Bungle?  How are we going to respond
to people like Mr. Bungle?
<p>
And as the conversation evolved, it became clear that this was
evolving into a kind of constitutional question because--footnote:
What had happened in the evolution of Lambda MOO, as happens with the
evolution of a lot of MUDs, is it starts out that the wizards set up
this program for the use of the public.  the wizards maintain the
database, maintain it at the level of code.  But also, as the
population gets larger and conflict emerges within the population,
`Oh, so and so stole my, you know, magic car that, you know, can drive
you to the moon,' and they run and complain to the wizard about that.
The wizards become involved in mediating these conflicts.  And as
things grew more and more complex, as Lambda MOO grew larger--and at
the time I arrived, it was--there were about 4,000 people coming back
to this place on a regular basis.  It shot up eventually about 8,000,
and then eventually there were population control measures implemented
that brought it down to about a steady 5,000 and that's what it's at
now.
<p>
So this is a vast community by--certainly by online standards and
certainly for a handful of wizards to manage autocratically.  And at a
certain point, the wizard said, `Enough of this.  We wash our hands of
it.  We will maintain the di--database, but you, the users, have to
figure out how to manage yourselves socially.' And this was where the
MOO was in its evolution when Mr. Bungle came along and when this
debate emerged.  And so they--there was no mechanism in place for them
to handle this guy.  And so it was this wide open question:  How do we
define ourselves as a community capable of responding to people like
this?  First of all, how do we deal with this guy?  Do we kick him off
the system?  Do we chastise him?  What do we do?  But--but how do we
implement the decision-making process that leads to whatever we do
about him?
<p>
And there were all kinds of ideas.  Well, we need to have a
parliamentarian system.  You know, we need to have--have an assembly.
And we need judges and jails.  And we--or we need, you know, come on,
you know, we're--we're fine as an anarchy.  This will work itself out.
Or there was this sort of technolibertarian position very common of
like, well, we can fix all these problems by just recoding the place.
And there was, you know, the royalist position.  Well, let's bring
back the wizards because, you know, they were born to--to this
position, and they--they--they're the ones who need to be strong and
rule.
<p>
But, you know, as you all know, deliberative processes don't often
lead anywhere.  It sort of went around in circles, and ultimately, a
wizard sort of had to do one of these leadership interventions and
say, `OK.  First of all'--one wizard said, `OK.  First of all, Mr.
Bungle is--is kicked off the system.' And then the arch wizard,
Haakon, a guy named Pavel Curtis, who works at XEROX Park and--and had
set this place up, said, `OK.  Yes.  And we need to implement a
system--a pol--a political system that can handle things like these.'
And what he instituted was a petition system whereby if anybody wants
a s--change to the code implemented that is of a social nature--in
other words, somebody wants to set up a system for arbitration or
somebody wants to set up population control measures that will be
built into the code, they can float a petition.  The entire community
can vote on it, and the wizards will implement whatever is decided.
<p>
And so just to round this out, I mean, I want to point out that
this--this very--well, let me just say that then what I wrote about
was the six months or so that followed the implementation of this
political system, which, you know, was as rife with conflict and
intrigue and the kinds of political narrative that we were, you know,
talking about this morning in a very exciting bare-knuckle stuff,
really rivaled in my study of other communities t--for--you know,
looking for comparisons only by, you know, Athens in, you know, the
high time of the--the agora in--in Athenean democracy.  So I just want
to say, `Look, there it is.  There's your existence proof.  This kind
of thing that can exist online.'
<p>
But I want to add, as--as Larry said, this is not something you just
bump into by logging on.  This is a rare instance of a rare kind of
rich community.  And I just want to signal, you know, before closing,
why I think it--it was able to achieve that kind of richness.  And it
has to do with the architecture of the place.  In other words, the
reason people are so invested in this place is because it is totally
programmable by anybody.  It is totally open to any player who wants
to come in and add programming to it.  There is a level at which, you
know, the wizards are in control.  But then finally, when a political
system was implemented, the arch wizard had the wisdom to say, `Well,
this political system has to work on the same model as the actual
architecture of the code.  It has to be open to anybody and, you know,
we will just serve as--as a kind of technological extension.  We will
be the implementors of the code.  We are not determiners of the
direction or of the discourse.  We are just going to implement.' So
I'll leave it with those couple of notes.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  OK.  Now I think you--I think you did a great job in
laying out the issues.  Are there particular questions that people are
stuck on, very briefly, before we contrast a different kind of
community?  Yeah.
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  Do the people who are in this process know who
Mr. Bungle is?
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  That's a good question.  And there--there was a lot of
debate about whether--you know, how relevant that was.  Because the
wizards were able to say, `Well we know'--because when you log on,
you're anonymous to the rest of the community, but you have to re--you
have to give your real e-mail address to the wizards.  So the wizards
knew what his e-mail address was, and they introduced into the
discussion, `Well, do you want to know what his e-mail address is?'
because then you could pursue him into real life.  And, you know,
either go to his systems administrator or, you know, make--go
for--attempt a legal intervention.
<p>
But they decided, no, that his transgression--you know, it would be
too weird to try to explain, `Well, you know, this guy, you know, in
my toy--little toy world came and, you know, violated my toy character
and, you know, he needs to be punished.' And so, you know, for that
reason and because just the sense of poetic justice, I think they
decided, no, the punishment has to be within this realm.  And, in
fact, one of the--the wizards did leak to one of the aggrieved parties
the--the e-mail, and she did not pursue that.  But--and--and it would
have complicated had they even gone there.  Because it turns out Mr.
Bungle was actually a bunch of guys who shared the account and, you
know, liability was sort of hard to pin down in real life.
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  Just a quick, quick follow-up.  So--so when
you put Mr. Bungle in a cage, are you putting the fictive persona Mr.
Bungle in the cage or are you caging the e-mail address or the
Internet address?
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  You're caging--you're caging his character.  You're
caging the--the vehicle with which he moves around in the world.

Unidentified Panelist:  So he could come back as somebody else.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  In fact, he did come back as somebody else, you know,
and there was--there was that kind of leakiness to the whole system,
but there was also a sense of, well, justice here is also operating on
a kind of symbolic level the way everything is here.  So justice has
been done.  He's been toted, is the--is the phrase they use.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Neal.
<p>
NEAL:  I'm a resident of Palo Alto and I'll tell you this is not
cyber.  This is Menlo Park politics.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  Who's Mr. Bungle then?
<p>
NEAL:  There's a lot of them.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  No, in fact, I should point out that--that the
people--the physic--the physical locations of--of the--the people in
Lambda MOO stretched from, you know, from England to Australia with
every place in between, with occasional interesting conflicts arising
from that, but, in fact, since it sort of hovered within the
Anglo-American world, you know, the cultural problems were not that
drastic.
<p>
Ms. DEB RONALD:  Do we know how many MUDs there are on the Internet
now?  Is there a way of tracking that or...
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  There are people who track it.  There are lists online.
I mean, it...
<p>
Ms. RONALD:  Six hundred?
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  ...it fluctuates between--it's--it's never more than
1,000, and most of them, also--I mean, not only is this kind of
community rare online, it's rare within the world of MUDs.  Most MUDs
are--are really strictly fantasy role playing games, and so they're
much more sort of scripted in a way.  And it's not to say that
interesting social formations don't happen on them, but...
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Right.  So the story you have in your--in your packet
is this account of the rape of cyberspace and then--in cyberspace and
then the construction of the democracy.  His book, "My Tiny
Life"--That's the title, right?--is really a wonderful account of a
much richer set of life that gets constituted here; all the community,
as well as individual.  Yeah, Michael.
<p>
MICHAEL:  I guess I missed the--what--this is--this is kind of a naive
question in light of the talk.  But what's the difference exactly
between this community and a fa--and what you just called a fantasy
role pa--playing world?
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  Well, it's just th--that there is an...
<p>
MICHAEL:  This is a fantasy world...
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  ...element of fantasy and role play involved, but
it's--it's the--the--the knobs on that part of it are turned way down
and the--and the knobs on, you know, actual social interaction not
mediated so much by the--I mean, a fantasy role playing game has--has
rules, to a certain extent, you know, and you can advance through
certain levels by engaging in certain scripted, you know, battles with
dragons and--and--and ax-wielding dwarfs and finding treasure and all
this.  A place like Lambda MOO is descended from that kind of world,
but it's--it's--it's--it branches off from that evolutionary tree.
<p>
At the moment where people started, you know, after the battles with
the dragons, started hanging out and talking about their problems and,
`Oh, I don't like the way the dungeon master's running this place.
Let's try to change that.' You know, there were kinds of social
formations going on around the edges of these games that people
eventually decided, well, let's just make that the main point of--of
the game.  And also, this--the building of--of--of the actual
architecture is--is not something you're not permitted to do in a role
playing game.  You have to fight your way up through the hierarchy
until you become a wizard yourself, and then the arch wizard may grant
it to you to--to build your own realm, whereas Lambda MOO is--is much
more democratically constructed that way.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  OK.  We're going to shift.  Unless this is really quick
because we're...
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  Very quick question.  Do you or anyone else
have enough information about the people's real lives as to how they
have 30 or 50 hours a week to spend doing this?
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  Yeah.  A lot of it is--I mean, when I say 30 or 50
hours, they're logged in 30 or 50 hours.  That doesn't mean they're
interacting all of that time.  They're--but they're open to that
space.  It's a window on their computer.  They may be actually working
in the Excel window or whatever, you know.  And obviously certain
kinds of jobs are more amenable to this or non-jobs, as the case may
be.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  There's a great book by Sherry Turkle called "Life on
the Screen," which is an effort to understand these people and their
relationship to this.  There's a great passage where one guy's
talk--describes living four characters at the same time.  So he has
four different screens open and he says, `Real life is just like a
fifth screen and it's not usually the most interesting one.'
<p>
OK.  We're going to talk--shift now to Marc Ewing.  So I described a
little bit about Linux.  I can tell you this:  There have been no leak
to documents for Microsoft that describes the d--justices--the Justice
Department's antitrust case as a threat to Microsoft.  But there is a
leaked document from the Justice Depart--from Microsoft that describes
what Marc Ewing's part of the world is doing as the single greatest
threat to Microsoft's dominance in the--in the operating system
market, and that's the open source software movement, and Linux in
particular.  And that's come from a community.  That's not come from
Marc--Marc's company.  It's come from thousands of people across the
world who have built this voluntarily.  No--you know, very
little--there's not compensation that builds this, so that's the
introduction here.
<p>
Mr. MARC EWING (Chief Technology Officer, Red Hat):  Right.  So I'd
like to talk about this open source software development community.
It's another online community.  And as you described this, I--I notice
a lot of interesting parallels, but--and I'm sure you all picked them
up as well.  And I think in--in Larry's earlier remarks, he--he sort
of alluded to the potential importance of open source software and the
products that it's creating.  And just to sort of back it up before
I--back up that statement before I jump into some more explanations so
maybe you actually believe me.
<p>
There are a couple of products, some of which you may be familiar with
or have seen in--in the papers.  One called Linux, which is a new
operating system that even Microsoft's produced at its trial as a
competitor, some--somewhat insincerely probably.  But it--it could get
to that point.  There are a few other products which are interesting,
which are also open source software products; one called Apache, which
I believe the recent Netcraft survey numbers have proven--have shown
that 56 percent of the Internet Web sites today are running on Apache.
So--so literally, when you go out and--and run around the Web, more
than--than every other site that you visit is actually running on open
source software.  An even more startling number:  There's a--a
software package called sendmail which is a--called a mail transfer
agent or it's basically like a server program.  The--it's the--it's
the software that delivers your mail from one machine to another
around the Internet, your e-mail.  And an astounding 75 percent of all
the e-mail on the Internet is delivered via sendmail.  So--so you're
already using open source software in a huge way, though probably
don't even know it.
<p>
So what it--I should describe what open source actually is.  There
are--open source is not a particular type of software.  It's not
necessarily a development community, but it--what it started from is a
licensing model.  And the license, unlike traditional proprietary
software models that you--you might get from--from Microsoft where you
get what's called a shrink wrap license that allows you to sort of
borrow the software as long as they want you to use it.  An open
source software license allows you to use the software in any way you
see fit, allows you to distribute it to anybody you want at no cost,
allows you to modify it.  And--and part of the open source software
license also stipulates that you get the source code, if you want to,
to your application.  And the source code is sort of the human
readable instructions which you can use to modify the operation of
your program.  So you can actually get that source code and modify it.
And you can distribute your modifications as well.
<p>
There's one key--there's one final element which says that--and there
aren't--there's actually sort of a spectrum of open source software
licenses, but there's--there's one key one which is called the GPL
which is sort of the founding father of--of open source software
licenses.  And it has a term in it which says that you can't--you
can't restrict the recipient of the software.  If you give the
software to them under the GPL, if you can--and--or if you pass on
software that you received under the GPL, you can't pass it along at
anything less than the GPL's permissiveness that--that you got it
under.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  So it has to be as open as...
<p>
Mr. EWING:  So is has to be as open so it perpetuates.  And you can't
eventually get all your software to be "closed," quote, unquote.  So
that's--in a nutshell, that's what open source software is.  What it
allows you to do then as a software consumer is to get software from
either off the Net or from a friend or from a vendor who might be
distributing open source software, tailor it to your needs, if you
need to, if the ne--a slight modification or a bug fix or an
improvement that you want to make, you can make it and you can
distribute it around your company, to your friends.  You can
distribute it to--to your business partners literally at no cost to
you.  There's no--no cost that you would have to direct back to
the--the initial vendor or creator of the software, so that describes
the license of the software.
<p>
And what has sort of built up around--around this license and around
the Internet is an open source software development community.  And
it's literally a community of--of hundreds of thousands of--of
developers and participators in the development of this.  They may not
actually be writing code, but they may be involved in testing
documentation or in--you know, in artwork, graphic arts.  And this
community is literally worldwide, and one of the--the great--one of
the great products of it has been this Linux operating system, and it
came about in the early '90s, just started by a guy named Linus
Torvalds while he was at school in Helsinki as part of an operating
systems course he was taking.  He started tinkering with a very tiny
little kernel of an operating system that just--it did very little
except for throw A's and B's at the screen.  But then he posted it to
the Net under one of these permissive, sort of open sour--open source,
the term had not been invented at the time--but a very permissive
license, sort of a do whatever you want, and if you got anything to
add to it, go ahead and do it and send it back.  He posted it to that
and said, `Anybody want a, you know--if you have any interest in this,
it's probably not going to very exciting but--but you might want to
check it out.'
<p>
And slowly, but surely--act--and actually, not that slowly.  I mean,
the course of six years, it's grown to the size it has to be a sort of
very capable operating system that competes effectively with other
UNIX operating systems and--and other server operating systems.  But
it did--it was sort of a g--gradual growth.  You know, at first, a few
hundred people downloaded it and--and made some improvements, sent
them back to Linus, you know, here's a patch, here's some more code
that you can add to your--your Linux product to--to make it better or
work on a wider range of hardware or to fix a particular bug.  And
o--over time, this grew to be a--to thousands of people have
contributed to the Linux operating system.
<p>
Now that's one particular way.  There--there--there's a number of ways
in which open source software can actually be sort of coordinated over
the Net.  As you can imagine, one of the--the criticisms of open
source software is there's no control.  It's--the quality is--is poor
because nobody is necessarily watching what's going on.  How do you
contain--how do you--how do you sort of funnel all this kind of
bubbling, you know, of energy around the--around the Internet into a
particular product that's packaged nicely and that people can use?
<p>
And true, that there's--there's a number of ways that that can
actually happen.  In the case of the Linux operating system, we have
what--what we in the community call the benevolent dictator of Linus.
And what--he makes the actual final say on everything that goes
into--into the soft--into the source code.  That's not to say that he
actually writes it all, because at this point, he's written less
than--by his own account, he's written less than 5 percent of all the
code that's in the Linux operating system.  But it is to say that he
either approves or understands the pieces of code that go in there or
has delegated authorities to approve pieces of certain segments of the
code to, sort of, his--his top lieutenants, of which there are maybe a
half dozen.  And they're responsible for certain segments of the code,
say, networking or file systems or graphics, things like that.
And--and--and--and among them, they make all sort of decisions as to
what pieces--what patches go into the code.  You know, somebody sends
a--sends a--a--a patch on.  It's evaluated, and it might be critiqued.
It might be sent back to the original author before it gets included.
But between them, they--they make the decisions.
<p>
Now if we go to Apache, which is again the Web server software that I
mentioned, it operates slightly differently.  There's actually a group
of a--of Apache sort of core team leaders and there are--I don't know
how many there are.  There may be a dozen of them.  But actually
make--they actually vote on code before it goes into the kernel--the
kernel of the--of the Apache product.  So it operates slightly
differently, and there's a whole range of--of different ways in--in
which open source software projects can be--can be led and managed.
<p>
But--but common to all of them is the--the--the kind of requirement or
reliance upon the sort of frictionless communication medium of the
Internet and the frictionless way in which new pieces of code can be
added to the source code and removed.  And this is something that
doesn't happen in proprietary software.  You can't just, as a user,
you know, rip out the networking code out of Microsoft Windows and
plug in your own version of the networking code and see how that goes.
And this frictionless ri--leads to the development of--of almost
Ameritocracy of--of the people who contribute to this code base.
<p>
You don't use a particular person's piece of networking code because
he's the guy at the company who wrote the code who was designated as
the networking guy.  You use a piece of networking code because it has
been proven by the community, or generally accepted by the community
that that's the best networking code in the world that has been
written for this particular--for this application.  And so the result
is--is sort of a bubbling up of all the--the--the best components of
all this developed software--of this open source developed software
around the Net.
<p>
And you get to kind of skim the cream and produce this--a wonderful
piece of technology at--at very little sort of--of direct expense to
anyone.  This is, you know, mostly volunteer time, side time.  It's
time contributed by people at--at universities, at research
organizations.  More and more, we're seeing now that time
and--and--and technology is being contributed by--by commercial
enterprises like Intel and Dell and Compaq and so forth because
they're starting to see the benefits of this open source model and
they're wanting to figure out how they can participate and help out
and strengthen that model so that, you know, the first six years
of--of--of this, you know, open source operating system development
are--are maintained into the next six years, into the next six years.
<p>
So it's a--I guess that's the--the fundamental description of the--of
the--of the community, and I think that you--you probably notice a
number of kind of similar parallels to--to the Lambda MOO in the way
this operates and the way people can contribute and build their own
parts of this sort of living code base and--and not--and not--well,
anyway.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  OK.  So a--so right now, you can go out into the World
Wide Web and download the source code for the Linux operating system,
all of it.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Right.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  And if you wanted to hack around with it and decided
you wanted to make a better graphical user interface or something, you
have the right to improve it.  And many thousands of people have done
that and then taken their improvements and given it back to the Linux
community.  It's a kind of gift culture you're describing where people
have devoted extraordinary amounts of time improving the source code
and then offering it up for others to take.  And Linus Torvalds and
the committee, at least in the Linux context, decides what's the best
that's been contributed and actually incorporates it into this code.
And this is made possible because of the communication structure that
you're describing, right?
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Right.  Right.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  And also possible because of the law in the sense that
the license makes it impossible for you to steal what's public and
turn it into something private.  And some people talk about the viral
effect of open source software and that is:  If you have a little bit
of GPL or a code that's produced under this public license and it gets
into your coding project, it can have the effect of making your
software unprotectable anymore because you basically promised not to
protect it, so it could have the effect of opening up lots of other
software.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  It's certainly a fear of some companies.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Some companies.  Right.  It's the hope of other
companies.  OK.  Now, again, just clarifying questions about this
structure that's been described here.  Yeah.
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  Red--Red Hat, I believe, is a public company
now, so what is the profit--where is the profit coming from if you're
just giving everything away?  From what I understand, it's
your--you--you have a l--you have a support model.  That's where
you're going to make your money, but in seeing as you're now becoming
a for-profit company, where--why aren't we--why--why couldn't we be
assured that you're not going to--even though it's open source, only
make sure that the open source bits that you want will get into the
final version of Linux because you've approved it as opposed to
letting other innovations that might, you know, work on the sides
improve it.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Right.  Well, first I think I should say this is sort of
a Red Hat directed question, so I'll try to answer it quickly.  But
Red Hat has always been, you know, for five years, a for-profit
company and, in fact, we're--we're only just now starting to
experience real losses.  But--yeah.  But--but the simple answer to
your question is that Red Hat d--does not control this community.  We
don't decide what goes into the Linux kernel.  We don't decide what
goes into Apache or sendmail or anything else.  These are really
community develop--developed projects.
<p>
Now what Red Hat adds to the mixture is--is--from our customers'
perspective, it's difficult to take advantage of these hundreds of
different development communities around the Internet that are
developing these great little open source projects.  So there's the
Linux kernel.  There's sendmail.  There's Apache.  There's a whole
bunch of other ones out there.  And by themselves, none of them are a
complete solution.  They're not an operating system.  Before companies
like Red Hat came along, sort of individuals and hobbyists would try
to put things together and--and for their own means and maybe for
their friends and for a smaller community.  But trying to bring this
to a much wider in--base of--of users is what companies like Red Hat
are all about.  And what we do is, you know, we take and coordinate
with all these--these development communities; take their code and
integrate it and test it and make sure it all works well together,
package it up nicely so it becomes a much easier solution for you to
either download Red Hat--Red Hat Linux off the Net or go buy it for
whatever than it is to put it together yourself.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Jay?
<p>
JAY:  Marc, would you explain the motivations of the people who
contribute to something like open source code...
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Right.
<p>
JAY:  ...especially the desire to win respect among peers, notoriety
for solving technical problems, to make a contribution to others would
use extensively and to otherwise distinguish yourself as a creator of
something the community is making together?  Because I think that's an
important part of the structure.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Yeah.  I mean, I--I think that that's exactly it.
That's--that's one of the key motivators for--for any of these
developers is that if you write a chunk of code and five people use
it, that's not nearly as exciting for you as if you write a chunk of
code and five million people use it.  It--it--it's much more sort
of--you f--not only do feel just like, oh, you--you've given back to
the community be--because of all the stuff you--you know, you feel
like you should have done because you've been using this code for so
long.  But it's just a great sort of personal pride in the fa--in the
fact that the community has accepted all this code and decided and
said--and by using it, saying that you're--you're a--you're a good
hacker, you've written a great piece of useful code that I can do.
But--and that--and that's--that's sort of the way it's been for--for
many, many years.  It's actually starting to change a little bit.
<p>
The interesting thing about software is that most software is actually
not written for sale.  Most software is not written inside of
Microsoft to sell or--or--or wherever.  It's written inside of
corporations or other organizations to solve their own kind of
internal need.  And what you're seeing now--and this is certainly how
sendmail came about.  This is how Apache came about.  And this is sort
of how Linux came about, but more on a personal level for Linux.
And--and what open source does is it's--it's sort of this--it's a
community that allows all these people who have been, up until this
point, developing their software--they didn't have really no
proprietary interest in.  They don't particularly care and to--to
maintain it necessarily or to keep it away from other people, but they
have had to go through the process of actually, you know, spending
time and develop it.
<p>
But with open source, now all these people are getting together and
say, well, hey, I've got this piece; hey, I've written this piece; or
hey, I've written this piece, and I can help you with that one.  And
they all get together and put it together so it's not a matter of--of
people necessarily volunteering huge amounts of time, although there
is that component that, you know, for the pride aspect of developing
the code that a lot of people use, but rather a sort of realization
and recognition of this--this already enormous pool of software out
there that isn't really encumbered by--by, you know, restrictive
licensing and trying to leverage that and turn it into something much
greater.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Julian.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  Well--it's--my question is sort of a follow-up to that
one.  What is f--funding these people?  I mean, are they doing it--if
they have to solve a particular problem for their workplace, are they
getting paid by their employers to write a little bit of open source
software?
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Right.  That's it's--for example, that's exactly how
Apache came about; is there were some people at--I think it was at
Wired magazine or wired.com or whatever their--HotWired or whatever
their online service was and they were using a particular--it's the
NCSA mosaic server or whatever it was called and it was--wasn't doing
what they needed to do.  So they started this Apache project and it
was funded by the Wired guys.  And this was the--the IS guys, the
system administrators, the Web masters at that company who made the
modifications and, you know, what do they care?
They--they--they--they gave it back to the Net and then enlisted the
help from other people at other ISPs or other, you know, Web
properties who also had the same interests.  And now more of
what--you're seeing similar things like the--the Dells and the IBMs
and the Intels of the world are also starting to contribute their own
technology that they've developed.  So more and more, a lot of the
technology is being written inside of corporations where the people
who are writing it have been paid to do it.  But that's only--that's
only just starting to become the case over the past three years.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  OK.  But th--but one common feature here that I think
is important answering, again, Jay's point; one of the attra--the
attractiveness in both of these contexts is this opportunity to be
constructing something, to be building something in a communal way...
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  Right.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  ...and--and this is a feature that explains a lot of
the excitement of--of this; a little bit different maybe from the
third perspective from our political consultant from the Internet.  So
why don't you introduce real-world politics dimension to this
community.
<p>
Mr. KEN DEUTSCH (Political Consultant, Internet):  OK.  And I'll just
start by saying I--I disagree with the dark side comment.  It is the
first time it's ever been tried, having been someone who has spent
much of my career working for Ralph Nader now to be called the dark
side.  But at the same time, I sort of take it as a compliment so we
must be effecting things.
<p>
It--it's very easy for the Internet to become a very negative impact
in politics or it's--or it's also very easy for it to become to add
something to the political discourse and to add something to
communities who want to push particular issues.  On the negative side,
it would be very easy to go on the Internet, assume false identity,
put things out there that are total misinformation to deceive people
without people being able to see who you are.  And, unfortunately,
there's a lot of people on the Internet who would believe it, so
that's one of the problems that's out there right now on the Internet.
<p>
In terms of the issues of community, in order to--for the Internet to
be a tool to actually improve political discourse in the community,
the key ingredient that makes it work is its interaction, the online
community with the offline community, and the two things working
together as one.  I'm going to give you a couple of examples of things
that aren't doing that and things that are, so hopefully, that will
give it some context.
<p>
Some people may have seen in the news in the last few days Dick
Morris' new project, Vote.com, which is a new project launched about a
week ago.  And on the site, anyone can go to the site and they can
vote on an issue.  And what the site then does--it then pops up a
little message saying, `If you give us your e-mail message--your
e-mail address, we will send the message to your elected officials.'
Well, it so happens that it doesn't check the e-mail address; it
allows you to vote multiple times.  If you keep entering different
e-mail addresses, you can put other people's e-mail addresses in, and
you don't see what elected officials it goes to and you--and at the
same time, the message that goes out, you have no idea what that
message actually says.
<p>
You just vote on something and move on.  You come back the next day
and that issue's moved aside and there's another issue there.  So
instead of building community, it's a one-way communication.  You come
in, you act on an issue, it pushes something to an elected official
and it moves on.  So you keep coming back and it doesn't do anything.
And I think that talks a little bit about Larry's comment about e-mail
and the Web not necessarily being something that develops community.
Where it develops community is where the two things work together in a
cyclical fashion to--to build support and to build interaction.
<p>
Similar things happen with just using e-mail rather than just using
the Web.  Many of you may have seen a message over the Internet over
the last few years about PBS funding.  Has anyone gotten that message?
I got the message twice in the last couple of months, and one of the
versions was sent to me by a relative who I won't mention who said,
`Oh, this is really important.  If you care about this,' you know.  So
I went down and I read, and first, I noticed the bill number that's
not a real bill number and then I noticed--and this was just about two
months ago.  Then I noticed that the message then talked about how
Newt Gingrich was in the process of doing this.  And what happens on
these issues--and these are often known as flash campaigns--is they
develop a life of their own.  Someone throws something out on the
Internet, and somewhere it started with a kernel of truth, and because
of the nature of the Internet, it takes a life of its--of its own on.
So one person passes it on to someone else, and finally it gets to a
point--this is just living in e-mail; there's no Web site, there's no
reference, there's no source, and as newer Internet users who haven't
been--this hasn't happened to before tend to believe it, because it
was sent to them by a friend who believed it, and they send it on and
it continues to live.
<p>
An--another similar one actually has to do with a modem tax proposal
that happened about four years ago where there was actually a proposal
in front of the FCC at that time and there was actually an issue.  A
year later, someone took the same message, changed the year from, I
think it was, '96 to '97 or '97 to '98, don't--lost track of a little
bit of time here, but they just changed it and recirculated it, and
all of a sudden, the FCC started getting all these messages, and
members of Congress started getting all these messages.  In that
particular case, there was monied interests on both sides, and it may
very well have been done on purpose by a special interest trying to
push a ce--a certain--a certain side of the issue.  So that's very
`one way' and it doesn't really build community because it doesn't
bring people back around.
<p>
I'll give you an example of a project we're working on, which--because
it's going on today and it's for a political client.  I can't
me--mention who the group is, but we have a client we're working with
that has a group of people who agree with them on their issue.  And
this week, as the budget's being debated, they found out on Friday
that a certain senator was going to pu--try to push something into the
budget that was going to affect their constituents.  Now they had
already set up a Web site.  They had already identified who it was
that agrees with them that--as part of their community.  These are
people who they've worked with on this issue offline.  They recruited
them to come online.
<p>
And when they came online, they identified their actual physical state
so they knew--physical state as in the state they lived in, so
they--they were able to identify from the people's address what--who
their members of Congress were, stored that information, so when this
happened this morning, an e-mail message went out to all the people
whose profile said, `Yes, I agree on this issue, and yes, I live in
this district,' and they were asked to come back to the site.  When
they come back to the site this afternoon and this evening, because
this is going to happen immediately, they're going to be asked to make
a phone call.  And so it's taking online action and online community
and spinning it back offline where it started.  And so it's a cyclical
effort of taking the online activity, building activity offline,
building activity online and building a closer relationship between
the organization that represents that interest and the people who
benefit from that interest.
<p>
What's actually happening is they press on something on their screen,
their physical phone line will ring, they press one, and it'll patch
them through to the right targeted member's office.  Then they can
re--type into the screen what was told to them, and the lobbyist
representing that interest can then see that information in a
real-time database.  And if they're hearing something different from
the lobbying or from the messages, they can then change the message
that the next people see who will continue to make the phone call.  So
it--it continues to evolve based on what's happening both online and
offline.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  So you--you've done this technol--this technique before
in other contexts?
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Yes.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  For other campaigns?
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Yeah.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  And--and so what you're describing is an
automatic--automated way to identify a community and get them to
engage in political action in a real-time fashion, right?
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Correct.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  And so--again, to make sure you get this picture, you
touch something on the screen, your telephone rings because they have
your telephone number...
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Right.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  ...you pick it up and then your telephone is connected
to a Capitol Hill telephone...
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Correct.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  ...that says, `Congressman so and so's office,' and
then you read what's on the screen that you're supposed to say to that
Congress person, right?
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Correct.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  And so you say, `So Congress person, I was
just--happened to be calling on this particular issue, and what do you
think about Bill X?' And then you report this information back.
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Yes.  And--and the--what--what happens is that the
congressional offices do not see that it's coming from the Internet
necessarily.  And unlike traditional ways of mobilizing people,
you--in typical grassroots, it's working on big ticket items, you
know, we support this or we're opposed to that.  Now what's able to
happen is that grassroots politics, because of the speed of the
Internet, can respond to things that grassroots were never used
before.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  So--so what's the numbers?  How many people are we
talking about that you're able to mobil--mobilize with?
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  You--you know, it depends on the issue.  There are some
issues that are hot-button issues that have a constituency offline,
that the group existed beforehand.  There are other organizations that
start on the Internet and the community starts on the Internet and it
moves off the Internet.  One example of that is a project we worked on
called gunfreekids.org, which started in late--I guess, in June when
the gun issue came up in Congress, and it has been building about a
thousand people a week.  It's about 16,000 people now.  There's
no--there's just starting to be an offline organization.  It started
as just Internet users then telling other Internet users and people
identified with the organization.
<p>
And so when we went to see where people were coming from--you can
actually on Internet sites look at logs of where people--how they
followed to get to that site, known as referrers.  And what we found
was that people were posting things to the Internet on completely
unrelated issues and they so identified with this organization that
they put in their signature line, you know, `I'm a member of
gunfreekids, visit it at,' and the postings are on completely
unrelated issues, but the people are identifying themself with the
organization and, in essence, that's what's creating the organization
is that actual dynamic.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  OK.  But then again, still broad numbers.  What's the
size that we're talking about?
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Broad nu--how many people have taken political action
on the Internet?
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Well, how many people...
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Or the different cases?
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  When you--when you try to brag to a client, you say...
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Right.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  ...in case X, we turned out...
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Well, on that particular case, there's been
16--gunfreekids, there's 16,000 involved people that have taken at
least one action.  At least a third of them have taken three or more
actions.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Is this the biggest you've done or is it...
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  It's--it--it--it really varies on audiences.  I think
from--that's the biggest, in terms of creating something out of
nothing.  We've also done some work for organizations that already
exist, that already had a base, as well as a lot of work for corporate
intranets where people are trying to mobilize their employees and can
easily get, you know, thousands of people to participate because
you're dealing with employees sitting at a desktop computer.  You know
the environment they're at so it's very easy to mobilize them.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Joyce?
<p>
JOYCE:  ...(Unintelligible) in politics.  I am in west Los Angeles,
and in the 310 area code, the telephone is critical to this story, and
we had introduced to us an overlay system in which we had to dial our
own area code for every local call.  This is a real annoyance.  And so
instead of dialing seven numbers, you have to dial 11 numbers every
time you make a telephone call.  A--a reporter for the Los Angeles
Times named Robert Scheer, who's--has a column and is very well-known,
became interested in this issue because a person--actually, he's a
cosmetic surgeon--was just furious about this and had called his local
assemblyman and gotten nowhere with the local assemblyman, so he
realized that there was no two-way street with his being a constituent
and assemblyman.
<p>
So bombarded Scheer, saying, `You've got to do something about this.'
So Scheer began writing articles about it in the west Los Angeles
edition of the LA Times.  At that point, several other people became
involved in it, among them three people who were very--who were
masters at setting up a Web site, and they set up a Web site.  And on
this Web site, they did the essential reporting and explaining of why
it was that the telephone company had run out of numbers.  And it
wasn't that they'd run out of numbers, it was the way in which the PUC
allocated numbers in these very inefficient batches of 75,000 at a
time.  So there are telephone companies all over America that have
great batches of numbers that aren't used, which has created this
artificial shortage.
<p>
Well, at that point, an assemblyman, Wally Knox, got into it because
it was his assembly district.  He got out on e-mail and said, `Are
you, you know, mad as a bee about having this dialing system overlay?'
Well, needless to say, the people who are on e-mail are the kind of
people who want to save their time.  So, of course, he got this
tremendous response from people who were interested in--in doing
something about it.  And they began e-mailing and phoning and writing
the PUC.  And it became a hot issue and Scheer wrote column after
column about it, but there's one other technology in this that's just
fascinating.
<p>
Fin--Wally Knox introduced a bill that said they were going to repeal
this overlay system, and they were going to stop it as it was planned
in several other places in the country.  And the bill was on the floor
of the Assembly, and I guess the lobbyists who were affected felt that
they had defeated the bill because they had put in a poison pill
provision.  Well, Scheer was on a cell phone and called the various
assemblymen who said that they were going to vote no, and said, `Why
in the world are you voting no on this?' And they said, `Well, we've
got this provision in there.' So about the last minute before they
were going to vote on it, he telephoned Wally Knox, again from his
cell phone, to the floor of the California Assembly and said, `Get
that measure--get that one item out of the bill because we can pass
this if you do it.' He took it out, they had the--the vote, it was
overwhelmingly successful.  We're getting rid of our overlay, and now
this is being sort of a model of what you--how you can be a p--an
activist using these multiple technologies, but it was essentially a
cyberspace story of e-mail and this Web site.
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  And I--I think one of the things that really makes
stories--the--cases like that work is that it's not just happening on
the Internet.  It's not an Internet community by itself.  It's
coordinating with people who have connections and with press and other
things...
<p>
JOYCE:  Right, the newspaper and...
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  ...that are integrated to make it--make it work.
There's a couple of cases of huge campaigns on the Internet that
brought the Internet community together, most notably the
Communications Decency Act.  And when the first round to that
happened, there was, you know, so many Web sites involved and e-mails
going on, but it didn't get beyond the Internet.  So everyone who was
involved in discussions on the Internet knew about the issues, but the
groups that could have helped turn the issue, if they had been
educated to get involved in the issue, were never reached out to
because they weren't on the Internet.
<p>
JOYCE:  The last e-mail I got on it was we're having a great big
celebration at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Congratulations.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Joel.
<p>
Mr. JOEL FLEISHMAN:  As I listen to you-all speak, what struck me
about what you said was that--that the--that the Internet was very
good at creating communities of like-minded people.  I heard that
essentially from everyone.  Those were Ken's terms in terms of
the--the way in which a facility--and I understand that.  In most of
our deliberations, we have been concerned about how you facilitate the
creation of communities of where there are differing minded people.
<p>
I mean, the typical geographical area has people who see--have
different views on everything.  We've been very much concerned,
whether it's--you're talking about a town or institution or you--or a
university or what have you or the nation, of how do you foster a
greater sense of community there in overcoming differences of opinion?
Where do you--where do you make that connection between people who
have--who--who are drawn to the Internet because they ha--they share
the same views on a particular issue and--and between others who
don't, who differ on those issues?  How do you create community across
those groups?
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Julian.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  I--I would say actually I didn't--in--in my and--and in
Marc's presentation hear anything about like-minded people.  I--I--I
heard about people coming together around shared--certain shared
interests.  In--in Lambda MOO, it may be cre--actually there aren't
too many shared interests in Lambda MOO.  Some people might be
building the place.  Some people might be there just to chitchat, but
they're all there because of these things that draw them there.  And
so you actually get a very robust argu--argumentative culture there
because people have dif--very different perspectives on everything
else.
<p>
Now this is leaving aside the eternal question of--of universal access
and the fact that, you know, the people that do not have access to the
Internet right now are very demographically specific in--in disturbing
ways.  But within, you know, the realm of--of--of online community is
you often get people drawn by one particular aspect of what they're
doing there, but who come from all kinds of different perspectives.
Otherwise--and...
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  But there--there is some--there's a feature of Joel's
question I want to make sure you're focusing on, and that is, Joel,
you're--you're confronting a context where people have no option to
leave.  They have to live with their neighbors.  They have to get
along.  They have to live in the university.  They have to get on.
<p>
Mr. FLEISHMAN:  That's right.  That's right.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  And a community in that context is learning to get
along with and dealing with people.  Now--and the perception, as I
hear, as an undertone to your question is that in--in these contexts,
people can just up and leave.  Now I don't actually agree with that,
that that's what can happen in here, particularly in Lambda MOO.  So
do you find--do you find people escaping when things get rough easily,
or what's the cost in leaving?  That's a way to...
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  Well, the cost--usually by the time you leave, you've
paid so much cost in torn hair and, you know, tears at your keyboard,
that there's not much of a cost of leaving, but there is an
investment, and there is a real gravity to these places that keeps
people there in spite of whatever differences they may have.  Similar,
I--I think--and Marc can speak to this.  I mean, there are huge
ideological debates that rend the open source community, but there is
an investment--they--they can't leave because that's the community.
I...
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  But--but focus a little bit more on this particular
feature.  If you've spent 5,000 hours building a character in Lambda
MOO, it's not like real space where you can just sell your house and
take your assets and move to another community.  You can't move that
character to someplace else.  So if this is the kind of life that you
like, then it's hard to transport elsewhere, so you have this feature
that you're describing.  Now there were times when you could move
characters; you know, there were facilities for moving characters.
But the fact that you can't leave is, I think, creating the feature
that you're pointing at.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  I should point out, though, that--that now from
some--on some fantasy role playing games in which you do develop very
programmatic characters by winning a certain amount of--of contests,
people are taking to eBay and auctioning off those characters when
they leave and--and liquidating them into...
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  that's great.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  ...into real assets that the other players will take
more seriously.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Cass?
<p>
CASS:  You know, these are two not extremely closely linked questions,
but they directly bear on what we've been doing.  There's a
psychological phenomenon called dupe--group polarization in accordance
with which, if you've got members of a deliberating body, by the end
of the deliberation, there'll be a shift in the more extreme version
of the direction indicated by the initial predisposition.  But if
you've got a group of people who think Clinton's kind of bad, by the
end of the discussion, there'll be a consensus that he's quite bad.
If you've got a group of people that think affirmative action is a
good idea, by the end, they--they'll move to the direction of thinking
it's a very good idea.
<p>
It's a statistical regularity.  And there's been recent work
suggesting that on the Internet, this is a potentially dangerous
tendency because it can lead to national vulcanization.  With
deliberating groups of individuals who have an agreement, let's say,
on something called X, and by the end, they'll think a very firm
version of X simply because they haven't been dispo--exposed to
competing views, they'll be uninformed and extremists.  OK?  So my
question I guess for Julian and Ken is whether they've seen anything
like that in the--in the work which they've--you've done?  I guess
when you describe the Communications Decency Act, in a way, that's
a--that's a story of popular mobilization against a crazy law, but one
might worry a little bit too much about government by referendum.  The
issues there are actually quite complicated.  Some of the e-mails I
got...
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Right.
<p>
CASS:  ...about the Communications Decency Act was just crazy stuff
where people were stirring themselves up into thinking Stalin had come
into Congress and was running it.  OK.  That's one point.
<p>
The other has--has a link, has--has to do with open software.  And
that is the suggestions you were making were really about the
advantages for--for consumers of having something where they can
remanage their own code.  But there's something that policy-makers,
Larry particularly is interested in, which you didn't stress--I'd be
interested in hearing your observations about, which is not so much
the consumers' advantages of open software, but the kind of civic
advantages.  And here, the notion is that Microsoft or Netscape or
something does a certain steering, and what's pernicious about it
might be thought is that it's invisible steering.  So that, you know,
you've got things automatically on the screen that you can't a--alter
very much.
<p>
Now some people think that these are kind of overstated concerns
because the political and market pressures on Microsoft, even if it is
a monopolist, are such that the steering is going to pretty benign.
It'll be NBC rather than ABC or one flower company rather than
another.  But is--this is really a question about your conception of
what open software is about.  Do you see it mostly as producing more
consumer choice in a way many but not all consumers will like or do
you see it as having important kind of civic function?  And--and maybe
you could be concrete about that.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Well, let's see how concrete I can be.  I--I would guess
I would see it as--as being both in choice in the sense of--of
allowing innovation both more rapidly and just simply allowing more of
it than you have in an enclosed environment.  When you've
got--infor--information technology infrastructures are--are--are not
necessarily unique, but they have this--sort of this network effect
where, you know, if everybody's using Microsoft Word, I've got to use
Microsoft Word, and these things have been talked about a lot by
economists.
<p>
And it--it--it becomes--the result of it is one--one corporation ends
up owning this infrastructure.  They get to own the innovation of that
infrastructure or and--or lack of it.  If they don't innovate, then
nothing much happens.  And so what open source does is really open
that up so that a--that the--the infrastructure is really all laid out
there for people to participate in either developing or not developing
if the public sees that it doesn't need anything.  But what I think is
dangerous is to let--let the--that decision be made in one place
in--you know, in--in a single corporation, not have the public be able
to participate or--or decide that, you know, that--that a certain new
feature needs to be developed or--or whatever.  That--I--I'm sorry.  I
missed the second part of it.  Wha--I was arguing.  I was going to say
that both of yours were true.
<p>
CASS:  Well, the--the other had to do with civic, and really what
you're emphasizing is the advantage for consumers of flexibility...
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Right.
<p>
CASS:  ...and do you--rather than the citizenship values, let's call
them, of decreasing private authority to steer via closed software.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Well, that's one that's harder for me to answer.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  It's interesting to note the origin here.  Th--before
the open--there was open source, there was a movement called the free
software movement run by a guy names Richard Stallman, one of the
MacArthur genius people.  Free software for Richard Stallman meant, in
one sense, software you didn't have to pay for, but that's not what's
important to him.  He meant free software in the sense of free speech;
that you build an architecture that is free of control, and anybody
can develop in any way that they want.  So for him, this civic feature
and for people in the free software movement that still lives today is
extremely important.  And...
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Yeah.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  ...are you--are you denying this importance?
<p>
Mr. EWING:  No.  I--I would say that's true.  But I think that, Cass
might argue that that's the same thing all over again.  That's
ju--that's not civic, but that's--again, that's just consumer control
and consumer choice.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Yeah.
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Ju--let me address the first part of that question.
I--I have seen it to an extreme in terms of the polarization that
happens, and it's mostly because people do get into these groups by
themself because it's very easy to find discussions just on your
perspective on the Internet.  There's actually a very dangerous
phenomenon being developed.  There's a new term--I don't know if many
of you have heard it called--hacktivism, which is--literally there are
discussions on it and there are people who call themselves
hacktivists.  And there are people who think it is a legitimate form
of political expression to silence their political opponents.  At one
point, when the--during one of the votes or at one point when the
gunfreekids site was very active, it was attacked by what is known as
a denial of service attack where someone on the other side of the
issue decided they didn't want these people to speak and sent so much
messages to the server that it brought it down.
<p>
I think the--in terms of how to counter that, you know, one--one of
the things very clearly is just that there's a problem with new users
to the Internet not knowing how to evaluate the type of speech that's
there; being very careful with my words here.  But it's--it's a
phenomenon of changing the type of media.  We're used to, as a
society, edited media.  And however--what kind of ever--influences
there are with the press, we already have our degree of cynicism about
the press.  People aren't as cynical as messages they read on the
Internet, even though they should be.  And so it's very easy for
someone who's got a hard-line position to drive the debate.  And I
think the--the biggest improvement that needs to happen is to train
people, whether it's in the schools or at a later age as well, how to
critically evaluate where that message is coming from.  Is it coming
from a special interest group?  Is it coming from a reliable source?
And then to--to act accordingly.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  But--but this is a m--market opportunity for you.  I
mean, Cass' phenomenon is what makes it possible for you to really
deliver Internet campaigns that are powerful.
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  Yes and no.  I mean, at the risk of hurting my own
business, which I--I--I often do--I mean, one thing I just did is
admitted one of our sites was--was attacked in that way.  And I think
that is actually one of the problem, is the--the self-interest of most
companies.  Hacking is a phenomenon that there's probably not a
corporation, a political group, a government agency that has not been
attacked successfully.  But no one wants to talk about it.  And the
fact that everyone's trying to deny these problems and push them under
the rug is why they continue to exist.

Mr. LESSICK:  OK.  We're running into a time problem.  We have two
questions here.  Jay, and then a question in the back.
<p>
JAY:  I read the--Microsoft's panicky memo about open source software
and found it quite interesting.  But I thought it could have been a
panicky reaction virtually from every Fortune 500 company and
hard-core capitalist in the country simply because of something that
Larry mentioned in an aside, the aspect of the gift economy that
operates in actually both of your cases, where there is competition,
there is an attempt to excel and to stand out, and there is even a
kind of scarcity in certain respects.  But you win not by accumulating
the most; you win by giving away the most.  And so that's a gift
economy, right?  And the people who succeed are the ones who create
the best things for the community, and those are the people who are
the winners in that form of exchange, which is the total opposite of
commodity exchange.  So if I was Microsoft, I'd be panicking for more
than one reason, because that's obviously a very different model for
how an economy can work, a gift economy.
<p>
So--and--and the reason this is important for us as a commission is
that it underlines why we're interested both in public discourse and
community.  When the underlying purpose of the community is to build
something of lasting value--and the subtitle for both of your
presentations would be:  If They Build It, They Will Come.  Right?  If
the underlying premise of the community is to build something of
value, then the discourse for that community has to be different than
if the underlying purpose is just to outdo everybody else or to get a
scare resource for yourself or to grab power or something like that.
So th--the discourse in the MUD and in the open source community is
it's task-oriented and it's oriented towards building, but it's--it's
different because everybody there is contributing to something lasting
and excellent, which is actually another model of public life, not
just a game or a software development method.  And that's, to me, why
these two presentations are really important to us, which is not so
much a question--I apologize for that--as a comment.  But that's what
I heard in them.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  But I--yeah.  I want to underline your use of the word
`model,' because, you know, what--what I sometimes get in talking
about the possibilities of online communities of various sorts is, you
know, `Well, how does it translate into offline action?' you know.
<p>
JAY:  Right.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  And--and the kinds of things Ken are--is talking about
are really interesting, but it--it doesn't invalidate situations that
are modeling things that might translate usefully into other
situations.  I--I mean, the MOO is really, I mean, entertainment.  I
mean, this goes back to Neil Gaylor's presentation.  I mean, it's
a--it's really ultimately a kind of entertainment, but, you know, if
the movies are important to us to talk about, then, you know,
in--in--in a political sense and in ways that they model political
discourse, then this certainly is such.  And--and the online--the open
source community even more so, because, I mean, their model translates
directly into so many other forms--realms of discourse that are
threatened right now by the increasing anxiety of corporations about
their intellectual property and that are--that are threatened by other
models, by an old model that's trying to, you know...
<p>
JAY:  Right.
<p>
Mr. DIBBELL:  ...assert itself.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  I'd like to come back to your--your initial comment about
all the companies being afraid of open source.  And you'll probably
find that most companies--and I'm talking about the IT industry--most
companies actually aren't that afraid of it.  Th--they see it as
liberating in a way.  And the reason Microsoft is afraid of it is
because th--they do at this moment sort of own that infrastructure.
And that infra--getting that--freeing that infrastructure and
be--making it become a public infrastructure rather than a p--a
private one is what all these companies see as--as a great opportunity
for them to be sort of lifted out from under th--from under Microsoft.
Maybe this gets back to Cass' civic thing because of--we're talking
about something as important as the communications infrastructure of
the future.  We're talking about the Internet.  We're talking about
operating systems, the basic communications stuff.
<p>
JAY:  Just to clarify, the thing that's threatening to them is not
open source software.  It's the gift economy.  That's...
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  ...(Unintelligible) I didn't understand this
as--this as necessarily as a gift economy.  I mean, that it's--by
putting your software out, you get other people to work on pro--you
find out who's working on problems which are similar to yours.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Well, yeah.  You see...
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  And, I mean, there's--there's--I--I don't want
to say it's--there's no altruistic spirit in this, but one could see
an ec--a clear economic...
<p>
JAY:  That's why it's a gift economy.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Yeah.
<p>
JAY:  I mean, the point is it's going both ways, right?  I mean, it's
just--it's not a direct compensation.
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  But there is an ec--economic...
<p>
Mr. EWING:  The gi--the giving it away...
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  It's consistent...
<p>
Mr. EWING:  ...what it--what it does is to serve is--is build you
up--your--your user base, right, or your constituents or whatever it
is.  It doesn't necessarily get you the money.  And that doesn't
service all of their needs, either.  And what it does is just sort of
shift the economy away from an intellectual property economy to a
service economy.  And th--this is what companies like Red Hat and
others are doing now and--and--we're not unique in this respect.  Most
of the software companies around the world are making this transition
now to be more service-oriented as opposed to this--this kind of
str--kind of licensing model.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  OK.
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  But Marc made another point.  You--you said it
was a meritocracy, that the best ones get used most widely.  And I
think the--the capacity for--to return a meritocracy to political life
is something that people--or economic life perhaps, too--is something
that people yearn for and haven't found the capacity in other mediums.
<p>
Mr. EWING:  Right.
<p>
Unidentified Panelist:  And so if this is really providing that, it's
another reason why it's of interest to--to us and the kinds of
questions that we're dealing with.
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  And I think one thing, just to be really clear with
that, is that I agree with you.  The danger of putting values on top
of the technology is--you know, the--the technology doesn't have
values, the technology leads itself to community.  It gives a whole
new range of communication tools.  And what types of laws and other
things are done are going to direct whether or not it moves in that
direction, or whether or not this technology is used to control
people.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  OK.  So now this is a closed technology I'm exercising,
and here's the last question.  Over there.
<p>
Unidentified Student:  Actually it's not a sub--it continues.  It's
not really a...
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  Great.
<p>
Unidentified Student:  But, first of all, I want to say thanks for
letting our class come.  We've enjoyed it.  And we'll have a lot to
talk about.  My question is for Ken Deutsch.  I'm just wondering if,
since you started lobbying this way--a radically new way where you get
to actually have everybody be a professional lobbyist because they
have a script in front of them--have the congressional staffs changed?
I mean, have they become more sophisticated technologically?  Have
they become more sophisticated in dealing with what used to just be a
constituent now is sort of a well-trained, well-versed
lobbyist/constituent?  And I'm wondering if it fed back and modified
the way the staff chain worked?
<p>
Mr. DEUTSCH:  It--it is affecting congressional offices.  And it's
affecting them in a way because the volume has increased and it's not
just because of the Internet.  And it's--basically, there's a, you
know, arms race going on between the different special interests to
increase what they're doing.  And what it's done is it's increased the
stakes.  So what happens now is that most e-mail messages, most faxes,
are just cataloged and they're not necessarily read.  So it goes to a
point where the personal contact becomes even more important because
of the increased use of the technology.
<p>
Mr. LESSICK:  OK.  Thank you very much.
