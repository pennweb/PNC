<p>
JUDITH RODIN.  Before we begin, I'd like to make one announcement.
Unless we decide otherwise, our meetings will be generally closed to the
press, but NBC has asked to record the very first moments of the
commission as
part of a related story that they're doing at Penn.  We've given them
permission to record only my opening statements and a couple of the
questions
afterwards before we begin our subsequent discussion, and I hope that
that's
agreeable to everyone.  I might also add that we are making audio and
videotapes of the entire proceedings, and that will be useful for us in
documenting the commission's work.  We won't distribute or release any of
the
comments or discussions or presentations, but I think we do clearly want a
running dialogue and running representation of the work here.
<p>
We've been working on this project for almost two years, and I'm thrilled
to
have so many of you here with us today.  Each of you has important
contributions to make to the work of the commission, and I know many, many
important contributions to our discussions.  I hope that you'll find our
process of working together to be provocative and challenging.  And
although
I know that our discussions and our task is serious and consequential,
I think we'll also have some fun.  This will be very intellectually
interesting and engaging, I hope.  It's in that spirit that I welcome you
and
thank you again for your willingness to participate in this project.
<p>
Our goal in the first meeting is to establish a shared context for our
discussion over the next three years and with your help and participation
to
chart the path ahead.  I hope to begin that process this morning in my
remarks
by giving you a sense of some of the concerns that motivated us to
organize
this commission.  As will be true with each of our meeting sessions over
the
next few days, my relatively formal remarks like those of all of the
presenters who follow are really intended only to trigger your own
reflections
and discussions and insights.  It is really in the conversation that I
think
we will learn.
<p>
Later in the commission's work, no doubt, we'll revisit many of the topics
opened at this first meeting, examining some of them in different ways
and,
certainly, thinking about some of them in greater detail.  But
establishing a
working framework for the remainder of our deliberations, I think, is our
primary task for the next two days.
<p>

Now why are we here?  Well, put simply, many of us believe that we're
approaching a critical moment in our society, a moment that may determine
the
shape of our social and political future for many decades to come.
Indeed,
this is a moment of such potentially significant social consequence that
it
imposes special responsibilities on leaders in every field but
particularly in
politics, in the media, the entertainment industry and business and law
and
perhaps especially many of us in the academic community.
<p>
Across America and increasingly around the world, from campuses to the
halls
of Congress, to talk radio and network TV, social and political life seem
dominated today by incivility, by ideological extremism, an unwillingness
to
compromise and an intolerance for opposition.  This dominance is now
widely
evident in the harsh and uncompromising character of American political
debate
in the resurgence of fundamentalist, religious and social doctrines and in
the
deepening isolation and self-segregation of many racial and ethnic
communities.
<p>
Overseas, it's expressed in the rise of virulent forms of nationalism and
xenophobia, in Europe, Asia and Africa, with such tragic human
consequences.
Among some of its most dramatic symptoms are the murders of physicians for
performing legal abortions, the bombings in New York City, Oklahoma City,
the
Middle East, the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.  Yet, it's pervasive
enough
to be plainly visible in the products of Hollywood and the daily
conversations
of talk radio and daytime television.
<p>
Indeed, incivility has become a routine subject in our popular
entertainments.
Maybe that fact alone tells us that most Americans share this perception.
According to a recent poll, 89 percent of Americans think incivility is a
serious problem, and 78 percent think that the problem has gotten worse
over
the past decade.  Of course, none of this is surprising.  Incivility and
polarization that's being perceived by most Americans are readily evident
in
our public culture.
<p>
But what first appeared to many of us as maybe minor skirmishes over a
narrow
spectrum of cultural and educational issues, what were called the
so-called
culture wars, have now become perhaps full-fledged nuclear conflict in
which
no prisoners are being taken.  Pat Buchanan's 1992 speech to the
Republican
National Convention reflects this widening of the battlefronts.
<p>
(Excerpt from 1992 Republican National Convention)
<p>
PATRICK BUCHANAN:  Friends, this election is about more than who gets
what.  It is about who we are.  It is about what we believe and what we
stand
for as Americans.  There is a religious war going on in this country.  It
is a
cultural war as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War
itself, for this war is for the soul of America.  And in that struggle for
the
soul of America, Clinton and Clinton are on the other side, and George
Bush is
on our side. <p>

(End of excerpt)
<p>
RODIN:  This kind of unrestrained warfare has now become the daily fabric
of our politics on both ends of the spectrum.  Take, for example, this
typically shameless excerpt from CNN's "Crossfire" program.
<p>
(Excerpt from "Crossfire")
<p>
BOB BECKEL:  Sir, let me just follow very quickly one question on
Massachusetts, since you raised the issue.  This, again, is out of the
Republican governor's task force.  Massachusetts welfare caseloads are
down
since the vaunted Weld welfare reform, but very few of these people found
new
jobs.  What has increased are three things:  prostitution, drug sales, and
Catholic Charities in Boston report a 31 percent increase in requests for
food
that they cannot meet.  Now if that's the result of welfare reform, take
it
and let Weld shove it! <p>

(End of excerpt) <p>

RODIN:  Ironically, this sort of treatment is so common today that even
the politicians involved take it as a given that it's politically smart to
oppose it.  Hence, I think we've seen the sudden eruption of pledges since
the
1996 election to seek compromise.  We can only speculate about how long
this
new era of good feeling will last.  But note that no one seems to question
the
premise that political debate has become too extreme, too confrontational,
too
coarse.  Of course, the examples we've just seen may be relatively tame
and
self-limiting.  For all of his extremism, Pat Buchanan was endorsing a
mainstream candidate for president, George Bush.  And if the polarized
pundits
on "Crossfire" really came to blows, no doubt cooler heads would
intervene.
<p>
Yet, I don't think we can afford to be too sanguine, because there are
other
far more troubling examples to consider.  Take the music of Tupac Shakur,
the
rap artist murdered in Las Vegas while under contract to Death Row
Records.
Did his death imitate art or were both merely reflections of the
nightmarish
reality from which he sprang?  Can we hear some?
<p>
OUTLAW
<p>
[Sounds of gunfire can be heard in background during parts of excerpt]
<p>
cause all I see is<br>
Murder murder<br>
my mind state<br>
preoccupied with homicide<br>
tryin to survive through this trial and rape<br>
dead bodies at block parties<br>
those unlucky bastards<br>
gunfire now they require maybe closed casket<br>
who can you blame ?<br>
it's insane what we did do<br>
witness an evil that these men do<br>
bitches see it too<br>
infact they be the reasons niggas get to bleeden<br>
but i'll fucken fire when I leave'em<br>
I shoulda seen'em<br>
hostile ho's catch elbows and grows disposed of<br>
and snitches get dealt with, with no love<br>
body bags of adversaries that I had to bury<br>
I broke tha law and their jaw<br>
all in tha same flurry<br>
but never worry<br>
they'll remember me through history<br>
causen motherfuckers to bleed<br>
they'll label me an<br>
<p>
Chorus
<p>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw<br>
they came into sin<br>
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw<br>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br>
<p>
RODIN:  He went on to tell the 11-year-old, `Got no time for the
the courts.  My only thought is open fire, hit the district attorney,
but fuck that bitch, because she's a lie.  Now it's time for her to
expire.'  Imagine the impact that such a popular artist has on thousands
of fans.  Every day the news is filled with new examples of differences of
opinions taken to absurd lengths.  Drivers in traffic jams are shot
because
they honked horns at someone in the next car.  Members of a fraternity at
the
University of Rhode Island brutally assaulted by the football team because
one
of the football players was ejected from a fraternity party.
<p>
Yes, there's always been violence in our society, and probably there's
always
been incivility in our politics, but this excerpt from Don Imus' talk
radio
program goes light-years beyond the slogan, `Mama, where's my pa?' which
was
used against the bachelor candidate Grover Cleveland in the presidential
campaign of 1884. <p>

(Excerpt from "Imus in the Morning")
<p>
"BEAVIS":  Hey, Bob Dole, this 15 percent tax cut of yours, how much am I
going to end up getting?
<p>
"BOB DOLE":  Well, about 15 percent, Beavis.
<p>
"BEAVIS":  Cool.  I was worried I was going to have to get a job first.
<p>
"DOLE":  If that liberal Clinton gets in again, you may have to get two
jobs,
Beavis.
<p>
"BEAVIS":  Not according to Bubba.  He says he's building a bridge to the
future. <p>

"DOLE":  Yeah, but what he's not saying is that it's a toll bridge.  Your
generation will be paying the toll to get over it years after that fat
liar
gets out of the White House.
<p>
"BEAVIS":  I just wish he'd get over talking about it.  Every time he
opens
his mouth, he mentions that stupid bridge.  It's worse than listening to
you
say, `Just don't do it,' three times in a row every 15 minutes.
<p>
"DOLE":  Yeah, well, good advice bears repeating.
<p>
"BEAVIS":  Here's some good advice for you.  Get out now!  Get out now!
Get
out now!
<p>
"DOLE":  Hey, Bob Dole's not going anywhere, you little (censored).  Bob
Dole's still got a chance to pull this one out, just like Christie
Brinkley
over there in New Jersey.
<p>
"BEAVIS":  No, Whitman.
<p>
"DOLE":  Yeah, and Walt Whitman, too.
<p>
"BEAVIS":  No, no.  It's Christie Whitman who pulled it out, not Christie
Brinkley.
<p>
"DOLE":  Yeah, well, whatever.  It makes sense.  I mean, who'd want to
pull
out of Christie Brinkley.  Certainly not my opponent.
<p>
"BEAVIS":  I bet he'd like to build a bridge to her.
<p>
"DOLE":  Yeah.  I'll tell you the bridge he really needs to build is one
that'll get him over Whitewater. <p>

"BEAVIS":  And then get Ted Kennedy to drive Hillary across it.
<p>
"DOLE":  That's a good one.  I like that.
<p>
(End of excerpt)
<p>
RODIN:  Even those who once felt some obligation to serve as role models
no longer feel any compunction about engaging in the most extraordinary
exhibitions of incivility and rudeness.
<p>
(Excerpt from CNN interview)
<p>
JOHN "ROCKY" ROE (American League Umpire):  My sadness and confusion
revolves around the original suspension of five days.  I--I--I think it's
totally inadequate.
<p>
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  What would you have done, Rocky?
<p>
ROE:  Well... <p>

REPORTER:  How can you protect him?
<p>
ROE:  ...I don't have all the magical answers.
<p>
REPORTER:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
ROE:  But the--the week before when, I believe, Pedro--whoever it was in
the
National League that had a--a--a fight where the player...
<p>
REPORTER:  Pedro Martinez.  Mm-hmm.
<p>
ROE:  ...threw the--threw the helmet at...
<p>
REPORTER:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
ROE:  ...the pitcher, he got eight days.  And in my judgment, spitting in
an
umpire's face is just as bad, if not worse, and--and--and in my judgment
is
much worse.
<p>
REPORTER:  Rock...
<p>
ROE:  Now you've set a tremendous precedent that anybody from now on that
wants to spit in an umpire's face, I guess, the--the worst that can happen
is
you get five days.  So it sent--sent a terrible message to the youth of
America. <p>

(End of excerpt) <p>

RODIN:  And then there is the largely invisible development of a culture
of unrestrained rage, sadism and insult on the Internet.  One journalistic
observer recently reported, and I quote, "An outsider peering into the
wired
life would probably take one look at the sheer bile that passes over the
wires
and come away with the impression that the Net community consists of 30
million virtual Visigoths pounding bloody knuckles on the keyboard and
zooming
around cyberspace in a testosterone jacked homicidal rage."  I will leave
the details to your imagination.
<p>
My point is really not to bemoan the coarsening and brutalizing of
American
culture, because I'm not convinced that it was really all that pretty
ever.
In fact, another of our tasks will be to place all of this in historical
perspective.  Indeed, one generation's shameful breach of good manners can
easily become an exemplar of respectful civil protest in the next.  Take,
for
example, this historical footnote from a recent documentary on the history
of
the White House.
<p>
(Excerpt from "Inside the White House" by the National Geographic Society
which aired on PBS) <p>

Narrator:  Today, the White House is an obvious and irresistible
target for protesters, but early in the century, the idea of protesting at
someone's home would have been considered a terrible breach of manners.
On
January 10th, 1917, the nation was shocked when women suffragists began to
demonstrate.  It was the first time a picket had ever been conducted at
the
White House.  The New York Times described it as petty and monstrous.
Others
called the picketing a piece of impudence, delude and dangerous.  `The
nation,' one editor wrote, `is shamed.'  For their brazen gesture, 97
suffragists were jailed for six months without a trial.  Their arrest was
eventually declared illegal, and the right to protest in front of the
White
House confirmed. <p>

Unidentified Woman #1:  Our book of peace is a book of 38,000 authors,
each
one of which states ...(unintelligible) `We demand that profit be taken
out of
war making.'<p>

Group:  (Chanting) This guy has got to go, hey, hey, ho, ho.
<p>
(End of excerpt)
<p>
RODIN:  Thank you.  But if something has changed, there's reason to think
we must look more deeply into it than the surface manifestations of
incivility
and coarseness.  It's my hope that through this kind of understanding, we
really may find some clues to effecting serious change.  Because even if
the
level of incivility and polarization is not new, it does seem that its
consequences are more dangerous and more widespread.  It seems as though
there
is some large and fundamental process at work at home, abroad and on
campus.
The incivility and extremism affecting our politics and our culture now
polarizes the discussion of almost every public issue and drives
successful
leaders and office holders to appease the most extreme of their political
supporters or to retreat from political life altogether.
<p>
In concert with the spread of wonderful new forms of democratic government
around the world, we also see an apparent rise in the virulence of
nationalist
movements and fundamentalist doctrines.  And as our campuses strive to
prepare
students for the global society of the 21st century, we see increases in
self-segregation and increases in intolerant behavior.  I suspect that
these
are not isolated phenomena but surface manifestations of some common,
deeper
dynamic.  But, unfortunately, in the face of such a world, the temptation
to
withdraw, to shut out the madness, to isolate ourselves, is understandably
growing. <p>

Last January, The Washington Post reported that we are becoming a nation
of
suspicious strangers.  Not only have we lost confidence in our government
and our institutions, but more and more we mistrust each other.  In every
generation since the 1950s, this mistrust has grown.  Today nearly two out
of
three Americans believe that most people cannot be trusted.  Thirty years
ago,
a majority believed the opposite.
<p>
Along with mistrust has come a decline in the role of mediating social
institutions, the institutions that once bound us together in multiple
communities and provided forums for education, for debate, for communal
interaction.  This leads, in turn, to greater social fragmentation and
individual isolation.  No wonder the evocative title of Robert Putnam's
article "Bowling Alone" has, in fact, become a metaphor for our age.  US
News
put incivility on its cover and asks:  What ever happened to good manners?
The right calls for a return to civic virtues; and the left tells us that
it
takes a village.  Of course, both have elements of truth on their side,
but
neither has a realistic roadmap for getting from here to there.
<p>
Prescriptive solutions based on a long departed and probably mythic past
are
not efficacious.  Self-righteous sermonizing about moral decline or the
values
of good citizenship are really quite unlikely to change powerful patterns
of
behavior.  Incivility and rigid political extremism are only the symptoms.
<p>
We cannot moderate their influence unless we have adequately
diagnosed and understood the underlying disease.
<p>
Of course, here, too, in terms of looking for root causes, everyone has
their
favorite suspects.  Many people blame the advent of electronic mass media.
They surmise that the numbing isolation of television, the anonymity of
talk
radio have fostered a generation of thoughtless, inattentive,
violence-prone
video junkies.  This argument asserts that it should come as no surprise
to
any of us if our world has begun to look like MTV, because our children
are
conditioned like Pavlov's dogs to experience the world in two-minute sound
bites and rapped, rhythmed patterns.  Add to that the apparently unlimited
debasement of entertainment and journalism on television, in film and in
print, the endless search for commercial profits and higher ratings.
<p>
Others blame the schools for failing to educate a more discerning
populace.
If a high school graduate can no longer write a serious essay or cannot
locate
Europe on a map, why should we be surprised when civic virtues are ignored
and
the ideals of civil society confused with the right to offend, to defame
or to
infuriate? <p>

Given the low voter turnout last month, it appears that many of us also
blame our political leaders.  We seem to believe that they're only
interested
in re-election and too often in the art of the deal.  Others believe that
we're just reaping the just desserts of the greed and
aggrandizement--self-aggrandizement of the 1980s.  They question:  How can
anyone respect our society when the few, the rich and the powerful control
everything and leave the masses to suffer in decaying cities?
<p>
We'll certainly hear many other possible explanations over the next two
days,
and I'm sure that each of us has an important hypothesis.  Whatever the
real
causes of our current rash of incivility and fragmentation, it certainly
is
the lack of new and creative thinking that bars the way towards change for
the better.  As a society, it seems to me that we have for the moment
simply
run out of good ideas.  Perhaps we're so busy trying to shout one another
down
because we lack any real sense of who we are, of what we believe, of what
reasons can be legitimately given to support our beliefs and what
arguments
really are available to convince our opponents.
<p>
Along with the very loudness of our public discourse has come a very real
shallowness, a thoughtlessness, an oversimplification in which reasons and
complexity and precision no longer seem to have any place.  Yet, the
situations of social and political conflict with which we are faced
today are fundamentally deeply complex.  Issues like affirmative action,
abortion, immigration, nationalism, even health care--they are difficult.
Their solution cannot come from a system of communication and
decision-making
that rewards the simple, that rewards the absolute or the extreme.
<p>
The irony is that our human abilities to communicate and cooperate
effectively
have seemed to falter, just as our technological power to share
information
and ideas is opening extraordinary new vistas.  Even more important, our
knowledge of human behavior is burgeoning.  Our understanding of the
complexities and contradictions of culture and tradition is vastly deeper
than
it was 100 years ago, even 20 years ago.
<p>
Many would argue that intellectually, scientifically, technologically, we
are
better prepared to confront the hard questions of the 21st century than we
were just a few decades ago.  And yet we have failed to mobilize this
knowledge in ways that create useful ideas and insightful understandings
into
the political and social problems that we face.  We have failed to place
contemporary issues in their historical and social context, not merely to
affirm past perspectives, but to generate new alternatives and new
approaches.
This is a critical role for each of our professions and for the
institutions
through which we practice them.
<p>
Thus, it falls to academic and professional leaders like us to take on
this
task with urgency.  We must find new ways of using and communicating and
applying our burgeoning knowledge and technological capabilities.  We must
begin to envisage new forms of intellectual engagement and public
communication that are equal to the tasks of social leadership in the 21st
century, not to impose simplistic solutions, but to open new
possibilities, to
change the dynamics of the polarized simplistic, in-your-face public
discourse.  We must create and inject something new into it--new ideas,
new
interpretations, new visions and perhaps new alternatives.  Otherwise, we
will
remain trapped in the unproductive polarization of the present.
<p>
If today's crisis is fundamentally cultural and intellectual, this effort
must, first of all, be cultural and intellectual and focused.  It must
start
from the premise that our culture is too important to fight wars over.
Rather, it is the great resource from which we must draw forth new answers
to
persistent and perplexing problems.
<p>
As I see it, this is an area in which each of us much assume the
responsibilities of leadership.  Individually and through our
institutions, we
must mobilize our best intellectual resources from the scholarly
disciplines,
from the learned professions, from the worlds of politics and journalism,
philanthropy, entertainment, business and the media.  Only such a broadly
conceived effort will be adequate to the task at hand. <p>

First, to identify and understand the true origins of our contemporary
social
crisis.  Second, to generate new insights, new interpretations, new ideas
that
will help us all to rethink the familiar and simplistic approaches that we
hear rehearsed every day in the media.  Only from such a process can the
new ideas and approaches we so desperately need be created.  Only with new
ideas and perspectives will we be able to make the best possible use of
these
new instruments of communication and information that are now appearing.
<p>
I think that is our responsibility.  It is our responsibility to teach
this by
example to our students and our colleagues and to the broader society.
Let
them see us engage in the hard intellectual task of thinking anew about
important social issues, to help all of us to learn to think differently
and
then to act differently about issues that matter to our society and in our
individual lives.  That is the task that we have chosen to undertake
together
through the formation of this National Commission on Society, Culture and
Community.  I am greatly looking forward to working will all of you, and I
thank you so very much for joining this exciting endeavor with us.  Thank
you.
