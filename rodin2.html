DON RANDEL:  I wager everyone in the room will have something
to say about that or something to ask about it.  Who wants to be
first?
<p>
Derek.
<p>
DEREK BOK:  Let me just mention a few things that are
sort of concrete issues that arise from the kind of talk you
gave.  Two are things in which, I think, many people feel universities
are doing less to promote and to contribute to open dialogue than
they did in the past; the third is an opportunity, perhaps, that
exists today that didn't seem so apparent in prior times.
<p>
I think, certainly, if you asked generally today about whether
university leaders are making an important contribution to the public
discourse, even about educational issues, I think the general
impression is that they're not, that there's been a real decline--I'm
not speaking over 10 years; I'm speaking over 50, 75 years in the
importance of educational leaders in engaging
the debate, even on educational issues.
<p>
JUDITH RODIN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
BOK:  And I think that opens up a number of questions about why
that should be.  Is it that somehow people aren't interested in
university leaders as much, or there are fewer opportunities?  Or I'm
sure part of it is that the job of an educational leader is very much
more hectic and leaves less room for this.  There's also very
interesting questions about what kinds of public issues educational
leaders ought to speak out on.  I come from a university
where university presidents in the past have spoken against
unionization, immigration, co-education and a great many other things
that give you pause about just how far afield from educational issues
one really would like university leaders to venture in getting into
the public debate.
<p>
But I do think there are a set of issues about
that.  I know in Boston the local newspaper, simply because of this
silence, reached out recently and said, `We want each university
president in the greater Boston area to write an op-ed piece, and
we'll make it available.' Curious that the impetus had to come from
the newspaper, because it felt that there was a vacuum there, rather
than being pressed to make space for messages that university leaders
wanted to get across.  So that's the first thing.
<p>
The second thing is, seems to me most people would believe is a trend
against what you've talked about--whether
the old norms that we took for granted about indoctrination in
the classroom are as clearly understood and as widely applied as they
used to be, whether there are not classrooms in which--no, there is a
kind of correctness that is imposed, using at least mild forms of
authority from the teacher.  And I guess I'm not aware, if that is so,
of very much that university leaders of my acquaintance have done to
deal with that, even though that seems to me one of the most
serious breaches of the kind of open dialogue which you so correctly
are pressing for.  But I think the idea that indoctrination
is actually a legitimate part of the academic mission is still held by
a very small minority, but it's probably a larger group than would
have held it, say, in the 1950s.
<p>
The final point, which is a sort of a new possibility, is I think one
trend that is going on that we're all familiar with is the
increasing sheer volume of information, often confusing, conflicting
and so forth, that swirls around us on almost every issue.
And as that takes place and as it's magnified by the Internet and
new technology, which is clearly going to add new dimensions to that,
I think a trend that's already visible is going to become even more
so, and that is that the role of the interpreter, the gatekeeper, the
person who kind of makes sense of masses of information, that tells
you what's really worth reading or believing, is going to become more
and more important, and that could be a real force for good or
for evil, but it does suggest a possible role for universities.
<p>
There is at least one example I can give from my own university of a
very innocuous role, but it exemplifies the point, and that
is in the area of health, where you hear so many conflicting things
about this study, that study and so forth--an enormous need out there
in the community for some kind of authoritative voice that could come
out and say, `Here is all the evidence and here are the conflicting
studies, and this looks to be a good summation of what we know and
don't know at the present time.'
<p>
And we found that to be enormously successful in terms of
hundreds of thousands of subscriptions of this kind of thing.  But
what it was really doing was taking a name that people trusted, a
university--at least they trusted it in terms of knowing medical
knowledge--and trying to help in sifting out, in this swirling
mass of information, what you could put some weight on and believe.
The question, then, would be, is there, in terms of the kind of public
dialogue we're talking about is there a role for universities to do
something more of that--not in terms of telling people what to
believe, but in helping to sort out, from an overload of information,
what do we know and don't we know that's relevant to this important
public issue, so that we can help people who are looking for
assistance in making sense of all this data--help them order the
information so that they can begin to think more intelligently and
more confidently about the underlying issue?
<p>
RODIN:  Let me start with the third and say that I absolutely
agree, and I think universities have often been reluctant to take on
that responsibility of informing the general public, even if it's
organizing and interpreting massive amounts of data.  The
Harvard Medical Newsletter may be one notable early example of a
different attitude, and what I was trying to describe were that kind
of initiative a hundred different ways, but really believing that part
of our mandate, at the present time, is to engage, via our knowledge,
the more general public and to help them to understand and sort out,
whether it's information of that sort or other kinds of ideas,
and hopefully, we will do more of that.
<p>
With regard to your first two points, I think that it is very clear to
everyone that university presidents have, over time--university
leaders have, over time, really either relinquished by intent or at
least by its absence, given how busy they are, the kind of role of
authority, whether it's institutional authority or authority in the
broader community, not only on educational issues but really beyond.
When that's commented upon, it's often attributed to the fact that
there are so many competing constituencies that have conflicting
motivations and conflicting views of what is right and wrong that the
university president, ever eager to raise more funds for his or her
institution, dare not offend any particular notable constituency.
<p>
I think that if we allow that to happen, we really are
relinquishing, in a way that would be tragic, the
role and responsibility of university presidents.  One of
the--just on a personal note, one of the reasons for wanting to
convene this commission was really to have an opportunity to be able
to engage a broader set of issues and a broader set of publics about
social issues and ideas that really are compelling to us in our
society, and where university presidents ought to take on some
leadership role, given the opportunity to convene colleagues such as
you to do something transformative.  And I think that we will be
able to do that, but we can't be gutless and we've got to be out
there, and being out there is really hard, and you need to get more
thick-skinned but you need, really, to be out there.
<p>
I think the classrooms have gotten politically correct, and I think
that, when we talk about a kind of roiling and robust debate, we're
going to have to push back on our own faculty and on our own
students, and we've got to be able to exercise a leadership role
to do that.
<p>
Lani and I have been engaged in a very interesting dialogue over the
past several months.  Many of you know that she identified that the
legal method of education, typically known as the Socratic method,
interpreted in a variety of different ways, seems to differentially
disadvantage women in the classroom relative to men, and the question
of how her colleagues took the data, both emotionally and personally,
and what they did with it in terms of changing the way they
teach, has been a cause of great concern to both of us.
<p>
So I don't say that these are easy issues and I don't say that we move
our faculties or our students or our alumni or trustees all at once,
but if we don't try, what have we given up?  Cass.
<p>
CASS SUNSTEIN:  Yeah.  I have a puzzle and two harmful
tendencies to talk about.  The puzzle is--you spoke very eloquently on
behalf of open discussion, but it is the case that no discussion is
possible unless some things are closed, so that every discussion,
including this one, is feasible only because we've ruled some things
off the agenda.  For example--this won't surprise you--at the
University of Chicago economics classes, graduate and undergraduate,
if you try to talk about whether preferences ought not to be taken as
given, that discussion--that's not acceptable, not because of any, I
think, really horrible notion of political correctness; just you can't
do the form of microeconomics that people are being introduced to if
you ask, `Should preferences be taken as given?' That's for something
else.
<p>
In biology classes at the University of Chicago, many other places, a
sustained discussion of creationism isn't going to be accepted.  In
constitutional law classes, lengthy talk about why the Constitution
ought to be taken as binding--that's not acceptable.  Now this is not
to say that these three forms of closing off the debate are bad;
far from it.  No discussion can work unless some things are ruled off
the table.  You can't discuss everything at once.
<p>
So the puzzle is--I don't think it's the case that any discussion is
fully open.  There are taken-for-granted assumptions that get
going.  Political correctness in the most expansive sense is
omnipresent and unavoidable and not to be deplored; that is, there has
to be some kind of orthodoxy.  So the puzzle is, when we talk about an
open discussion, what exactly is it that we're talking about?  I don't
really know the answer to that.
<p>
OK.  The two bad tendencies are--I think it would be good if we had a
more concrete sense of things that were operating in current
universities that weren't working well, and let me just throw out two
possibilities.  One is on the left--identity politics, where we
understand identity politics to be encapsulated in the
phenomenon--I know at Yale a couple of years ago some classes--law
school classes were common in which people would say, `As a white male
I think,' and then it would be some retrograde position on rape, and
it was thought that the ascription of the characteristic would
authorize the retrograde view.  And in any case, the view
would be that the identity would be determinative of the argument, so
that these positions were fixed and argument wouldn't be possible
across identity.  So that's very destructive to education.
<p>
On the right, there is something associated with Leo Strauss, and that
is the great books tradition, taking the great books to the
authorities that have teachings.  "The Closing of the American
Mind" by Allan Bloom is a famous--and let me just say
polemically--exemplification of that view, where the great books
are not taken as invitations to think hard about a problem, but
instead as teachings that you get something concrete from.
That's kind of the right-wing version, I think, of identity politics,
and in a way it's its flip side.
<p>
I think both positions have a conception of truth, which is
transcendental, and that's why they're each other's flip
sides.  In any case, the puzzle is open discussion; no one would be
against that, but what exactly the ideal amounts to, I think, is a
puzzle, which is not to say that it's not an admirable ideal; it is.
But I think it's more complicated to get concrete on what it
entails, exactly, and the other is to think, maybe, what are the
antonyms to the things you're speaking for.
<p>
RODIN:  I guess I don't inevitably see the opposite of closed
discussion being open discussion.  When I talked about closed
discussion, I meant the discussion of closed minds, rather than the
discussion that takes place away from the light of day and away from
the analysis of people other than yourself.  I think that that's a
very dangerous thing as well, but it certainly is true in any kind of
deliberation that there may be circumstances where everyone in the
room does not serve the outcome well, and no one, indeed, would have
had the expectation that they ought to be there.  So in a way, for me,
that's a straw man, if that's the opposite side of the continuum.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  I didn't really mean that.  I meant that, in any
discussion, there are some things that are closed off, both in terms
of subject matter and position.  Like in this discussion we're not
talking about, you know, the Vietnam War, and we're having certain
shared assumptions which to question would be not productive, partly
because we really share those assumptions and we think it would be
you know, if I said something Nietzschean, you would think, `Well,
that'--and so it may not be even that raising this point is
productive but the suggestion is that many people who I
think you would think would be disagreeing with you would actually
agree with everything you said and say, `We're in favor of open
discussion, too.'
<p>
RODIN:  I understand.  Larry.
<p>
LAWRENCE LESSIG:  I want to follow up on something
Cass said, and then bring it back to something Robert said earlier.  I
think there's a fundamental ambiguity in the idea of things being off
the table.  You at some point, Cass, said `ruled off the table'; at
another point you said `things are off the table.' And I think they're
very different ideas.  I mean, it is true a conversation proceeds with
things that are off the table, but the perception that goes along with
ruling things off the table is often extremely destructive, and the
confusion about political correctness is often that things are ruled
off the table, and it's the very ruling that people rebel against.
<p>
Now the point I wanted to relate back to something Robert was
saying--Robert's question was:  Are we able to talk to these questions
to the people?  And there is an issue about whether we should be
worrying about the people, but I think there's a question that is
quite significant in relation to what you were saying about the role
of education or universities in this discourse.
<p>
At a time when universities, in Cass' sense, the authority of
universities is off the table--everybody takes it for granted--then
what presidents of universities say is credited, just by virtue of
that authority.  But when the authority of universities or the
presidents of universities or institutions like this, in a sense,
aren't taken for grant--that authority isn't taken for granted or it's
up for grabs, then you have to compete for authority through our
words.
<p>
Now it's a great--at least for academics--us academics, it's our
great handicap that we speak in sentences or in paragraphs or in
pagelike thoughts, right?  We have extended an--sometimes quibbling
but sort of extended ideas that we want to express carefully.  That's
the way we talk.  And we live in a world where that talk communicates
nothing to most people.  That talk is ineffective.  And so we, oddly,
even though we think of ourselves as, in some sense, above this--we
are handicapped by our very way of engaging, handicapped in speaking
to people.
<p>
So to regain the authority that existed when these institutions were,
in a sense, taken for granted as authorities, is for us is gonna
be very difficult.  And that doesn't mean we don't have things to do.
I'm reminded of Lani's contribution, the very first of
our meetings, where she described structures we could create that
would help bring about transformation in the way in which
our students or people think about things.  And that was using our
particular expertise, but not depending upon our ability to
communicate things directly.  It was using our expertise about
pedagogy here in seeing how we could structure situations that help
people change--obviously related to Jim Fishkin's work as well.
<p>
So here's a place for us to imagine us having an effect which doesn't
reveal our handicap, mainly that we don't know how to speak
in one-word bites, but does actually suggest how we could do something
out there.
<p>
RODIN:  I think that's very compelling.  I think that there
are--the assumption that university presidents carry with them now the
authority of their institutions is one that we are challenging,
because I think the institutions are really losing the confidence
and trust of the general public.  And so if we are to take on this
task, whatever this task is that we ultimately decide that we are
well-suited to, not only within our own university community but as we
reach out to the broader communities, I think we shouldn't delude
ourselves; we ought to recognize that part of what we will need to do
is to regain the public confidence--not only because we speak
differently, but because there's a real sense of mistrust in the
nature of the academic mission, in what we are teaching our students
there.  The politics of the left and the politics of the right,
as Cass characterized earlier, are just one of the ways in which we
have turned against one another and made accessible to
the broader community a sense in which we are made to be
suspect--views about the cost of tuition, views about indirect cost
recovery; all of these issues are now thought about by the general
public as ways that universities should be viewed as suspect.
<p>
So there's a larger challenge there, Larry, than I think the
one that you characterized of university-speak.
<p>
MICHAEL USEEM:  I have a question about help for a person like
yourself, and it's going to go as follows:  The list of leadership
qualities that you identified--passion, vision, integrity,
wisdom--seems to me right on the mark, and in hearing company leaders
talk about what they want, they often have almost the same list.  And
then the second thing they'll say is that `I want these qualities to
be exhibited by all 50,000 people that work at this company, because I
can't do it alone.  So I really want 50,000 leaders besides myself
here, but then, following that, there's also the quick
observation that it's really hard to make that happen, like `I can say
we all should be owners and leaders here, but we've got 50,000 or
49,999 who are resistant for whatever set of reasons.'
<p>
So as you think about our university or any university, any thoughts
about how you can carry some of these qualities through the
organization, how you can draw faculty, administrators and students
into exhibiting these four or five qualities you've identified?
<p>
RODIN:  You can't start it without modeling.  It's not the only
step, but it is the important first step.  And so when I think about
myself as a university leader or my colleagues or leaders in other
venues, really demonstrating those characteristics is number one, and
demonstrating that those characteristics can move an institution,
but also can and often do make an individual, including the
individual leader, feel quite uncomfortable.  Then I think you really
need to very systematically take each level of your institution--and
you're an expert in how institutions really confronted with
this have come to the conclusion that they need to delayer.  You can't
do it with very bureaucratic hierarchical organizations and get too
far down in the institution.
<p>
So both corporations and universities, and government, as I'm sure
we'll hear in a few moments, are highly bureaucratic, and bureaucratic
environments really run counter to the kind of additional leaders that
are necessary in order to move a set of shared agendas forward.  I
have never really liked the concept `follower,' because I'm not really
sure what that means.  What you need is a kind of mutuality of
leadership where sometimes the most effective thing a leader can do is
really sit back and let others define agendas and participate once
you've constructed a certain frame around that.
<p>
And it's not an easy task, but it is an essential task, and I
guess, as I said, the only wisdom at the moment is that it
cannot be done well in a highly bureaucratic environment, and it can't
be done well in a highly regulated environment.  And it's why, as
I said in my comments, I really am so opposed to regulation being seen
as a way to make things work well.  I think that they're the
antithesis to things really working well in an institution where ideas
and exploration and openness, in the best sense, really need to move
the agendas forward.  Drew--lots of comments--we will get--go ahead.
<p>
DREW FAUST:  There's a certain tone--I don't think this
works.  Yes, it does.  There's a certain tone of nostalgia here about
what has been lost and that universities are confronting that they
didn't have to confront before, and I'd like to challenge that a
little bit, and I think in a way that relates to Cass' point, which is
that partly what we have--universities are suspect because they
represent changes in society, particularly in the realm of diverse
communities, in a way that many other institutions do not.  And people
living in universities probably are living in the most diverse
environments that they ever have lived in or ever will live in.  And
so when we talk about things being off the table or not up for
discussion, or we talk about classes being more politically correct
now than they were in the past, I think we have to recognize that we
are confronting daily all kinds of challenges and questions that were
completely off the table in the 1950s.
<p>
If we're talking about American history classes--and I have many
distinguished colleagues in American history here--when American
history was being taught in the 1950s, you didn't have to worry
about political correctness because you were dealing with a consensus
school that didn't talk about conflict, that didn't talk about
African-Americans, that didn't talk about women.  There was no fight
to be had, because the fights were all defined off the table.  Now,
happily, we're all fighting, and I think that political correctness is
probably less in--at least in the context of teaching American
history, than it was when we didn't even recognize that we were all
being politically correct without knowing it.
<p>
So I think that we should not just be nostalgic for a lost past; we should
also be
celebrating, in some sense, the fact that universities are the
institutions in this society that are confronting this in a very
direct way, and in the only way for many Americans, I think, who
otherwise are in very separate living situations and operating
situations.  And I think we should also celebrate that the kind of
subject matter we're dealing with is inviting these debates that we
welcome, but we have to be the institution to deal with the challenges
of, and that that's a very important part of this that should keep us
from longing for a world we have lost.  We should instead, I think,
celebrate the one we've gained.
<p>
RODIN:  That's important.  Jim.
<p>
JAMES FISHKIN:  I have a brief comment on Cass' question, but
then I have a question stimulated by your presentation.  My comment
for Cass is, when he raised the question about economics
department ruling preferences, whether they ought to be satisfied or
taken as given, off the table; it seems to me that he said that is
for something else.  Now the crucial ambiguity there is, what is the
something else?  I think, in a really well-functioning university, the
presumptions of one course or class or discipline or department that
are open to serious intellectual challenge--the presumptions
of one such part of the university should be raised by some other
part of the university.  For example, a lot of places--or some
places--have a program in philosophy, politics and economics, as Cass
well knows, where exactly those questions would be discussed and
raised quite fruitfully.  And that's, indeed, the special power of
interdisciplinary programs.  So it's not ruled off the
table for the entire university just for the purposes of being able to
have a discussion on one particular course.
<p>
RODIN:  That's a good point.
<p>
FISHKIN:  Now I'd like to move on.  I think that--we had an
interesting--our discussion this morning in our working group on
community intersects a good bit with your
presentation in the sense that we raised or discussed some related
questions.  And we actually had some disagreement--very friendly
disagreement--about, I guess, the issue could be put what is the
main product of the university?  For example, it's both people and
research.  Now if it's people when we're thinking
about the people, after all the university produces graduates, are
they graduates who are being prepared for the job market?  Yes, of
course.
<p>
But are they also graduates who are being prepared for the role of
citizen?  I tried to say they were--but some of my
colleagues thought that that was old-fashioned or there was no longer
the consensus to support that.  I think that's a very important
presumption because we're preparing people possibly, also, for the
public dialogue.  Some of them will be leaders but some of them will
just be citizens.  And it seems to me, then, if we think of that as
part of our purpose then that impacts on how the university does its
business and on the opportunities offered for students.
<p>
Now Texas has a very quaint requirement that students have
to take two semesters of political science and two semesters of
history.  I actually don't think it helps them that much preparing for
citizenship, but I haven't fought it because it serves our
purposes.  It gives us more students than we can handle.  But it
raises a question.  Obviously, the Legislature--this is by state
law--the Legislature thought it was serving some purpose.  It raises
the question:  What would you do in order to help prepare people for
citizenship?  For example, some universities make special
efforts to provide opportunities for internships, for tutoring
programs, for public service.
<p>
These things, I think, are enormously rich--probably a lot better than
political science--in getting people to have some sense of public
responsibility.  I also think that from the research side and
that's just the beginning of an agenda.  You can see I haven't
thought seriously about this, but I think it's one of the things we
might think about at some point.  On the research side, as well as
the impact on the students who are in a sense a product of the
university--on the research side we--you and I would both
remember that the debate at Yale when they were going to get rid of
the Institution for Social and Policy Studies, which was a place that
had its weaknesses as well as its strengths, regardless.
<p>
But it was an institution that was designed to contribute to
public policy debates.  And the problem with institutions in the
university environment designed to contribute to public policy debate
is sometimes their work is thought of as applied or not theoretical
enough or not serious enough.  I think in the Yale case it was
resolved after I left but I think there was some kind of compromise
where they kept the institution and took away most of the money.
<p>
But it seems to me that that there's an
issue.  Does that kind of research have a role in the university?  I
think it does.  But some universities might not.  So there's an issue,
both on the research side and the student side.  Does
the university have a role to contribute to the public dialogue and
the dialogue among citizens?
<p>
RODIN:  Let me comment briefly because in my prepared comments
I hope I made quite clearly the point that I believe it does.  But
I think when you educate students for citizenship and I think we
absolutely do and must educate them for citizenship, that the last way
that we want to do that is by thinking that they're going to get it in
their history or political science courses.  Educating for citizenship
really means an engaged student doing--whether it's public service or
independent research so that you really can learn about the creation
of new knowledge, how to challenge information.  All of the process of
what we do in universities is what trains them for citizenship.  Very
much less is the substance of what we give them, that trains them for
citizenship.
<p>
Of course, we want them to be educated and informed and have
knowledge, but that's the kind of baseline activity of really
creating a student who will be the kind of citizen for the future
that we hope holds the promise that is making us do what we do.  In
terms of universities and I have never found the theoretical
applied schism to be very appealing, because I first of all,
because I now lead the university founded by Benjamin Franklin who
believed that those two do go hand in hand and that it is the role of
the intellectual, both in the university and in the broader society,
to integrate the theoretical and the applied.
<p>
So I'm much more comfortable with it at Penn, I guess, than I was at
Yale.  But, in fact, I think that it is critical.  I really do and I
think as I said earlier, that we must take on that
obligation more frontally as universities.  And if we keep saying,
you know, `We're the institution that just does it theoretically' and
leave it to others to think about the application, and now I'm not
talking about applied research or going out and necessarily
solving social problems, but at least asking that our engagement be
broader and deeper with our communities, with our society and with the
social issues that our fundamental enterprise really can influence and
make a contribution to.
<p>
Bob.
<p>
ROBERT WIEBE:  What you said now is precisely the lead in to
what does concern me when I listen to your, you know, your beautifully
presented talk.  You started by giving a picture of--and I think it
was received sympathetically--of the university as a neutral, as a
depoliticized sort of cover over which much variety in the case of the
arts, in the case of the conservative journal--you stood back.  You
said you didn't stop them from doing what they did.  And you
presented, to me at least, if not from you, it came across as a sense
of the dispassionate, the even-handed, the neutral overarching
university.  But you end with the impassioned plea to engage and I
think engagement is very messy.  I think engagement risks all kind of
damage to a university.  I'm for it.  But I think it's very risky
and somehow or other I lost in your talk that sense that we
really are bringing our institution to the edge oftentimes.
<p>
And we must take positions, sometimes very complicated
issues, as universities in order to be properly engaged.  I had a
sensed that there was a kind of...
<p>
RODIN:  I must...
<p>
WIEBE:  ...antiseptic sense of how the university could engage itself.
<p>
RODIN:  If I conveyed that I misconveyed it and my view,
both in those three instances and my colleagues were there, and also
in the comment that I just made I think belies that.  I don't think
it's antiseptic and dispassionate.  I think that you need to create
the context in which all of these ideas truly do bump up each other
and people do dirty their hands and make one another angry and
all of...
<p>
WIEBE:  But dealing with the wider world is distinct from within the
university.  Yes, to be neutral to allow that kind of debate inside
the university is one thing, but engaging issues of how to use public
resources in the area of University of Pennsylvania...
<p>
RODIN:  It wasn't even neutral within the university and it
surely isn't neutral as it extends beyond.  Any behavior demonstrates
a stand and so the only neutrality is inaction and I'm arguing for the
opposite of that, for really being able to engage and deliberate and
be active and take the risk that you will offend somebody else.  But
when you do, the response isn't to neutralize or make antiseptic what
you originally thought.  It's to take it in from the other side and
let it all really confront one another.  So I really do believe
just the opposite of, at least, how you characterized it at
this moment.
<p>
Neil.
<p>
You tell me when to stop.  Five more minutes, right?
<p>
NEIL SMELSER:  I'd like to come at that dilemma from a
slightly different angle.  In opening our study--task force,
study group, working group this morning I presented a dilemma
to--to the group contained in the phrase, `This is a free country,'
which is invoked all the time to put the burden of unacceptability on
somebody else, right?  That anything goes.  Now in a way you were
invoking a liberal or a free vision of the university when you said,
`These things can go.' I mean you try to civilize them, you try to get
other things to go on.  But you rule against them and that they
were--you didn't say they were unacceptable and take actions to
prohibit them.  But I think in microcosm that reflects the same
dilemma of how do you--by what ground rules and on what
defense do you find anything unacceptable?
<p>
RODIN:  I think that's an important question and it's, in some
ways, the question that Stanley Fish raised in the op-ed piece that we
had in our materials on the New Palz situation.  I
don't--and he condemned the university president, in that instance
of--many of you who read the article will recall for really falling
back on kind of free speech and universities as being places where
there has to be the expression of ideas without defending
substantively why that particular conference was important as a
way of countering both Governor Pataki and the Boards of Governors.
<p>
I think those are legitimate questions.  I tried to say that I
don't think it's about free speech.  I think it's about--although I
believe in free speech.  I also think that although you said there's a
fairly liberal view in what I articulated, there's also a fairly
conservative view because I don't believe in regulation of this kind
of institution as being--in the traditional sense of rules and
prescriptions and mandates and speech codes as being ways for
universities to govern themselves either.
<p>
So the answer, though, is not for the president to take a
stand on every issue.  The answer is for the president to create an
institution in which people do take stands, where they feel safe
enough to take stands, where they can come back together at the end of
that and still work together as a community.  And it is really hard.
<p>
SMELSER:  I know that the traditional university has downplayed
authority as an institution.  It's not very much based on
authority, it's based on persuasion and a lot of other means and a
corollary of not having authority in an institution is that people
will govern themselves by individual commitment or through force
of collegiality or other forms of community and one wonders
whether that particular institutional equation still exists.
<p>
RODIN:  Oh, it's closer to Michael's question. Don?  Do we...
<p>
RANDEL:  One of the threads that runs through this, I think, all
the way back to Gary Clark's comment has to do with this notion of the
university as expert, which often confounds our thinking about the
university because there clearly is a domain--multiple domains in
which we are experts.  The difficulty is now that there's a great deal
at issue which is contestatory, in which it's not agreed that the
university or the president of the university can be seen to be the
expert.
<p>
So the difficulty for us is not how to model the discussion about the
things we know about; should you eat more fiber to--should you--etc.--
in The Harvard Newsletter or even how to build a
rocket.  But it's things as simple as what books ought your kids to
read?  In that sense, the great books' notion itself is often
sustained by kind of view of the university as expert.  Aristotle was
an expert on politics and that's why you want to know what he said
about it  rather than how to discuss something fruitfully about
which there is, in fact, no agreement.  I fear we have diverted you
long enough, Judith?  Thank you very much.
<p>
RODIN:  Not me.  Thank you.
<p>
RANDEL:  My last duty is to say we get a small break now but it
must be a short one, given that we have overspent our time.  So let's
say five minutes if at all possible.
<p>
Thank you very much.
