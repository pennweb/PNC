We have a responsibility to attempt to frame a debate in the public
arena regarding issues which, although not always at the center of
public consciousness, strike to the very heart of this nation's reason
for being and what it can offer, both to its citizens and to the world
at large.  This country's experiment that we all know, begun in
Philadelphia over two centuries ago, has yet to achieve in total its
grand agenda and promise, but it is not for the lack of trying that
achievement is not fulfilled.
<p>
In any civilization, public discourse provides the best avenue to the
improvement of the government and the lot of the governed, but
especially here in this grand country, that avenue has spawned many
twists and turns throughout our short history.  In many ways, the
silence of public apathy has been deafening.  To paraphrase Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., `The greatest tragedy of this period of social
transition may not be the strident clamor of the bad people, but the
appalling silence of the good people.'
<p>
My intent is not to offer you a history lesson on military
involvement.  We have too many historians here that I've been talking
with.  But nor is it to detail a prescription of contemporary activism
and political military affairs.  Rather, my intent is to provide a
hopeful, provocative framework which we can use to stimulate debate
and thought today and reasoned discourse tomorrow.
<p>
There is no easy formula for social progress.  I know of none, have
experienced none and offer none.  For some reason, a quote from John
Steinbeck came to mind as I was preparing these remarks.  I can't
remember where I read it or heard it, but it goes something like this:
`Ideas are like rabbits.  You get a couple and learn how to handle
them, and pretty soon, you have a dozen.'
<p>
I'm hopeful that some of the ideas I outline today will spark your
interest and spawn your other ideas.  If we work on them, we may come
up with one that are better, or maybe we can have a dozen.
Improvement in the condition of man vis-a-vis society and the
government has been hard to come by for most, and in the main has been
evolutionary and not revolutionary here in the United States, thank
God.  So what we can do here can have a positive impact on our growth
as a nation, if we are blessed by wisdom from some higher force and
stay the course.
<p>
Public behavior and responsibilities of institutions, the theme of
this assembly, constitute a full plate of challenges.  Two days of
discourse and thoughtful reflection do not a renaissance make, but if
we are indeed thoughtful and build a careful framework, we
may spawn a broad conversation in this land, at least at the academic
level, which just might make a difference.  Let's hope so.
<p>
I began public service over 50 years ago, long enough to have
experienced a great many challenges, wins, losses, draws, and what
some have called character-building opportunities.  My experience has
taught me that while never perfect, always a little bit too slowly to
my liking and filled with starts and stops, this nation seems to find
the right solution to social, national and international problems.
Why?  Because our collective and sometimes accidental dedication to a
document scripted over 200 years ago was declared a goal for its
citizens, so correct in thrust and so universal in application that it
still lives with timeless characteristics.  And as you heard last
night, our speaker made that point.
<p>
While the creators of this nation may not have fully understood the
grave social consequences of their pronouncement that `We hold these
truths to be self-evident:  that all men are created equal,' they took
the great risk by stating that `We mutually pledge to each other our
lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.' And, my friends, so does
the armed forces of this country so tacitly promise, each to the other
and collectively to the nation.
<p>
Throughout the history of this country, the military forces of the
nation have played a central part in this development, and not just in
the fighting of its wars, but in exploration, building, research and
in evolution of its leadership systems.  It can be safely said that
the framers of our Constitution really got it right when they crafted
a relationship between a military and a civilian government.  In
another circumstance, we might not be meeting today and discussing the
challenges President Rodin has laid out before us.
<p>
We have indeed experienced a renaissance and a relationship
which has evolved between the military forces of this country and the
government, and likewise society as a whole.  Our country began with a
citizen soldier Army, and although the current version is all
volunteer, we still savor the citizen soldier ethic in our forces.  At
times, the military has felt estranged from the population.  At the
very beginning of our country, during the days of the Articles of
Confederation, during the latter stages of the Indian wars of the
1870s, during the Bonus March of the 1930s, the period immediately
after the Korean War and, most recently, the tragedy of the war in
Vietnam--in each instance, the country was focusing on other issues
which diverted the public consciousness and generate ambivalence.
<p>
Kipling said it all:  `For it's Tommy this and Tommy that, and chuck
him out, the brute, but his savior is his country when the guns begin
to shoot.' In each instance, the military family felt ignored and
unappreciated, retreated into itself and became insular, and in each
instance, the estrangement passed.  Such is the resilience of the
force.
<p>
Today I sense a philosophical difference between the center of gravity
of the military services and the current administration.  This
philosophical difference does not bode ill for the country; it does
make for some uncomfortable cocktail parties, however.  The focus of
the military service is steady and resolute, execution of the mission
and the defense of the country.  The difference find their grounds in
how to achieve the mission, not in fundamental issues of the
relationship between the military services and the government or the
country as a whole, and this is the strength of our relationship:
allegiance to the Constitution.
<p>
But perception of the character of the mission and
redefinition of the roles and responsibilities of the service tends to
turn on these philosophical differences.  The military services tend
to be conservative; not politically conservative, but philosophically
conservative.  We now stand in the aftermath of the Gulf War, which
placed the military in a somewhat surreal landscape, and almost
bloodless, at least for our side, and one perceived by many as a
computer game war, which implies expectations for the future
which I frankly don't think will happen.
<p>
Our military also faces a redefinition of its roles and missions,
especially in the mission category, which now includes peacekeeping,
which may be an oxymoron label which, when applied to military
forces--the transitions required of the military in this area are
significant and demand great skill and proper definition and
execution, both by the civilian leaders of the government and
within the military hierarchy.
<p>
We need to enter into a national dialogue to achieve consensus on
emerging roles and missions issue.  The ramifications of peacekeeping
stand at the center of the question.  At the same time, the military
is in the midst of one of the largest, proportionally, reductions in
force levels since demobilization after both World Wars I and II, and
its success during the Gulf War, even in the face of these reductions,
is a testament to the quality of the men and women who are recruited
to serve their country.
<p>
But with all the good which resides within the military forces of this
country, there is also some bad, which infiltrates from
the civilian community from whence the force is built.  We have all
seen infiltration of skinhead--the skinhead culture and a terrible
legacy.  We are currently faced with sexual harassment and misconduct
issues which require a great deal of understanding.  While the
undercurrents of these and similar aberrations have plagued the
military forces for decades, they are somewhat isolated and
correctable.  And even though some will take issue with the pace of
activity in addressing these issues, I am confident that they will be
resolved in a just and a forthright manner.
<p>
The military can be relied upon to fix what is broken.  It always has.
And in fundamental issues of social fairness, the military has led the
country in doing what is right.  Sexual harassment and sexual
misconduct cases with the armed forces represent the exception and not
the rule.  According to the Department of Defense, sexual misconduct
involves less than 1 percent of the military members.  Sexual
misconduct is illegal under military law and is swiftly punished, as
current cases have shown.  Sexual harassment and gender discrimination
are more prevalent and, I suspect, harder to uncover and rectify.
<p>
Just the increase in the number of women service members since 1973
tells me that this is true.  In 1973, 45,000 women in
the military services constituted 2 percent of the force.  Today they
represent about 14 percent of the force, some 195,000 strong, an
increase that shows the services are continuing to lead the way in
diversity in the force.  But sexual harassment and gender
discrimination are not tolerable and won't be tolerated in the
military services.  Why?  Because they're wrong.  They interfere with
mission accomplishment and they erode morale.  Commanders won't stand
for this.  The issues of leadership and responsibility for the led
stand at the core of the commanders' values.  They will fix the
problem.
<p>
Today's military services are the most diverse in history and the most
integrated major institution in America.  We have come a long ways,
but we still have some distance to go.  And as you know, or having
heard, I entered the Army at the end of the Second World War.  It
was a segregated Army and a segregated country.  And while I can take
risks and spill my blood in defense of democracy, I had to sit in the
back of the bus, eat at the counter--in the kitchen, wait in a colored
waiting room and drink from the colored-only water fountain.  And my
enemy, the German and the Italian prisoners of war, rode in the front
of the bus, ate at the counter, sat at the larger white-only waiting
rooms and used the white-only water fountains.  Not a pretty picture,
but a true one, and one which many good people today either forget or
simply forget to remember.
<p>
Here is another example of how it was back in those days.  I, along
with other blacks, attended an integrated officer candidate school in
1944-'45 at Ft.  Benning, Georgia.  But when departing the post after
graduation as a brand-new second lieutenant en route to a segregated
unit in the Pacific, four of us, all black shavetails, were harassed
by two white enlisted MPs.  But in 1948, a plainspoken man from
Missouri pronounced the following, and I quote:  "It is the declared
policy of the president that there shall be equality of treatment and
opportunity for all persons in the armed services, without regard to
race, color, religion or national origins."
<p>
This, my friends, is the exact text of President Truman's Executive
Order 9981, issued on the 26th of July, 1948, which ended for all time
segregation in the military services of this country.  There was some
foot-dragging, but that too passed.  And my service, the Army, led the
way, albeit slowly.
<p>
Let me give you three quick examples of both the good and the bad to
illustrate my point.  The first example has to do with President
Truman's executive order.  Immediately after the order was issued, all
commanders were directed to read the order to their personnel.  I was
on reserve duty at Aberdeen Proving Ground between semesters in
Muhlenberg College; hence, I was present.  I was present in the
theater when the post commander, a colonel, assembled all the officers
and read the order.  And he then said, `As long as I am the commander
here, officer club number one, officer club number two,
non-commissioned officer club number one, non-commissioned officer
club number two, swimming pool number one, swimming pool number two,
will remain unchanged.'
<p>
It doesn't take much of a brain surgeon to figure out what he's
talking about.  He said that as long as he was the commander, there
would be no change at Aberdeen Proving Ground.
<p>
Example number two:  As the first black infantry company commander in
a recently integrated 2nd Army Division in 1955 in Germany, my
soldiers, both black and white, often found themselves defending
theirs and my honor in off-duty locations where soldiers gathered.
<p>
A third example can be found again in Germany.  When I assumed command
of the 7th Corps in 1978--I might add the 7th Corps at that time was
the largest corps in the United States Army and was the very
successful corps that operated down in the Gulf some years later.  At
that time, however, we had the mission and responsibility of defending
freedom in the central region in NATO.  Manfred Rommel was the
overburgermaster in Stuttgart, which is the home of the headquarters of
7th Corps.  Manfred was the son of the great field marshal, "Desert
Fox" Rommel.
<p>
Anyhow, he, Manfred, was and is a rabid defender of fairness and equal
opportunity and two of us worked together to develop the right climate
in Stuttgart for all of our personnel.  Some illustrations.  When our
soldiers would find themselves discriminated against in a cafe or a
restaurant in Stuttgart, the facility quickly received all kinds of
frequent health and sanitation inspections by the city health
department.  When our soldiers were not permitted--or were not picked
up by taxicab drivers leaving Stuttgart to come back to their bases,
those cabs or the offending cab company received all kinds of
increased attention from the safety and transportation offices of the
city of Stuttgart.
<p>
And just yesterday, I'm delighted to say I received a very interesting
two-page Christmas letter from Rommel.  He is really a giant among
many.
<p>
Please note that none of the aforementioned examples took place in
combat.  Why?  When the shooting starts, we're all brothers or sisters
under the skin.  In 1966, black soldiers constituted about 18 percent
of the combat units in Vietnam and, as expected, constituted about 18
percent of those killed in combat.  At the same time, blacks made up
about 11 percent of the population.  And, of the total Army at that
time, black soldiers made up about 13 percent of the enlisted force,
but only 3 percent of the officers.
<p>
Why this apparent failure on the part of my service?  Well, it wasn't
so much the failure of the Army as it was the failure of the country
to offer the equality in the civilian community which President Truman
had ordered in the military 18 years before.  The young black man with
ambition had neither the educational opportunity nor the economic
opportunity in the civilian world in this country to get ahead, as he
saw it.  He was right.  The Army and the armed forces, as a whole,
offered both.
<p>
Combat units of the Army could use the skills, such as they were, and
the Army shock troops--the airborne soldiers, the special forces
soldiers--offered additional $55 a month for paratroopers at that
time.  The combat units offered the chance for leadership and a young
black was seeking status.  He found it and did his duty, and he did it
well.
<p>
So it should come as no surprise that blacks migrated to combat units
for better pay.  And it also should come as no surprise that these
units produced the most casualties.  The young
black man found a grudging equality in a stateside Army, and he found
real comradeship and equality in combat.
<p>
In between World War II and Vietnam, there was Little Rock, Oxford,
Tuscaloosa, Birmingham, Memphis and other tragedies, but the military
was trying to get it right, because an order had been issued and a
policy had been sustained by successive administrations.  It ended up
leading the way, and still does, in my judgment.
<p>
American society, as a whole, have been moving more slowly.  I
believe, however, that education can accelerate the pace of positive
social change.  I am convinced that education is the reason that I am
where I am today.
<p>
Let's look at some statistics.  Your current Army has a better
statistical balance with respect to minority distribution in the Army
as a whole than it did back in 1966.  Minorities now:  about 30
percent of America.  Minorities make up about 39 percent of the Army.
Minorities are 45 percent of the enlisted force.
<p>
What is clearly more important than statistical balance and
distribution of the total force is the fact that incumbents in a
position of leadership reflect selection on merit.  The Army is truly
a meritocracy.  Advancement is based on achievement and what you know,
and not on who you are or who you know.  This environment has produced
the following:  minorities constitute about 20 percent of the officer
corps; minorities make up about 50 percent of the non-commissioned
officers' corps.
<p>
Now I'm sure that you're wondering why the continuing disparity in
this mix; that is, officer vs.  enlisted, vs.  the country as a whole.
Well, the answer's quite simple.  It's education.  To be a
commissioned officer in the Army requires a college degree almost 100
percent of the time.  Educational levels within the Army break out
like this.  Officers with bachelor's degrees are about--about 86
percent.  The remaining 14 percent generally have a minimum of two
years of college.  Enlisted have some college
--enlisted with some college, a baccalaureate degree, of about
25 percent, and the remainder have a high school diploma or a GED.
<p>
Now compare the foregoing with the following national statistics, and
I think a bell will ring.  Minorities constitute about 16 percent of
all college graduates, at least as of March of 1995.  Remember, I
cautioned earlier that education is the key, and it still is.
<p>
There's another thing that troubles me as we run out the clock on this
century.  We have clearly moved to 100 percent volunteer force.  Only
the most senior officers and non-commissioned officers of today's
services are products of conscription Army.  Whether they were drafted
or not, they have that leveling, and it is that leveling
which citizen soldiers bring to the party which we may have lost.
Whether this loss is damaging, I don't know, but I wonder just as
well, and I think so.  The draft was a leveling instrument of
democracy.  In its original form, it ensured that all able citizens
participated in the defense of their country.  They all had hands-on
experience in being a patriot.
<p>
One of the most important aspects of the draft was that it kept the
general population connected with its military institutions.  Almost
every family in America had a family member who was serving or who had
served in the armed forces.  Additionally, the draft ensured that the
military didn't become too insular.  It kept the military in touch
with main street USA.  On the other hand, the Vietnam era was a victim
of tinkering by Johnson era Congresses, which produced poor man's
vulnerability due to questionable deferment categories.  In short, we
skewed the drafted force to the low end of the socioeconomic scale in
our country.  In my judgment, this was wrong.
<p>
My feeling is that every citizen should make a personal investment in
this country in order to appreciate what it offers, and in so doing
learn about other citizens, a process which is otherwise routinely
missed.  In short, every citizen should feel and learn diversity.
<p>
Don't misunderstand me now.  I'm not
advocating a return to the draft, per se; I am advocating introduction
of a period of national service for all citizens.  This national
service should include options for military service, a teacher corps,
a health corps, conservation or environmental corps or a service corps
with the Veterans Administration, Bureau of Indian Affairs or other
governmental support areas.  Participation in national service would
be mandatory, initiated by registration for the draft by every
18-year-old, both male and female.  Deferments could be issued for
attendance at college, but participation after college graduation
would be required.
<p>
Eighteen-year-olds could have the option of volunteering for the draft
after graduating from high school.  By volunteering, the draftee would
have a choice of programs, with military service having a scholarship
program as it does today.  The system would operate in a manner
similar to the operation of the selective service system, which even
today requires all 18-year-old males to register.  Of course, the
call-up remains mothball in case of national emergency.  The
operational framework is there, and criteria for national service is
not that hard to develop.
<p>
It would take some real political courage to see this idea through to
fruition, but I believe the political costs would be worth it, and the
opportunity for our young people to feel and learn diversity
would be assured.  Diversity is good for us.  We need only to
understand it in order to appreciate it.
<p>
The military service have learned how to deal with diversity and, more
importantly, how to profit from it as an institution.  They are not
perfect yet, but they are way out in front of the rest of the country.
To twist a motto of the infantry, `Follow me.  I am the military.  I
will lead the way.'
<p>
Diversity is a force multiplier in its most basic form.  It can be a
fundamental force multiplier for the nation.  Therefore, we need to
embrace it and nurture it.  National service can become a means to
that end. <p>

While we move to a greater acceptance of the value of diversity, we
need to ensure that the pluses of diversity are not obscured by
the overzealous application of numbers-crunching and prophets of doom.
For example, in the current debate on affirmative action, it is my
judgment that neither side of the question is right.  It is much more
important for us to expend our precious energy on preparing
all our citizens for inclusion in this society through quality
education than to squander time and resources on frail arguments on
quotas and distribution, both pro and con.
<p>
We must take a lesson from the armed forces training
establishment--the basic training arena.  It is in basic training that
wars are ultimately won.  It will be in our education system, K
through 12, that the future of this society and this nation will be
assured and the quality of our armed forces maintained.  To borrow
from the real estate saying invoked today which trumpets, `Location,
location, location,' we must realize that `Education, education,
education' is a key.  Quality education for all should be the mantra
recited by all concerned citizens, and all citizens should--let's
change that.  All citizens must be concerned.  We as leaders must make
it so.
<p>
While the meritocracy of the armed forces prove that pure competition
on a level playing field can produce the requisite opportunity for all
and ensure quality in the force, this reality, unfortunately, cannot
be readily and immediately applied to our current society as a whole.
We have shortchanged underclass, which cannot fairly compete for
opportunity in this society.  The obvious common denominator in the
opportunity equation is education.  We need to have a massive attack
on the education deficit of the underclass, which, I might add,
includes white as well as people of color.  This attack on the
education deficit must hit both the target of equality of access to
education and a target of quality in education.
<p>
We need to rid ourselves of the cottage industry of special
interest groups, which has grown up around the core of civil rights
movement of this country, championed by Dr. Martin Luther King and
his legacy.  We need to replace this throng with enlightened
citizenship, all citizens intent on one goal:  `that all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.'
<p>
We do this by investing in a country's intellectual potential, fully
infused with the diversity of this country.  Why?  Because such
investment will be the salvation of this nation, and because the
military services, the harbingers of social change in this country,
will become better than they are today as a result.
<p>
How many people--young people out there are just waiting for their
chance to follow in the footsteps of May Jamieson or Goizueta, the
late president of Coca-Cola?  We simply cannot afford to waste any
more youth.  We mortgage our future to do so.  We doom ourselves to
mediocrity if we shrink from our responsibility.
<p>
Recently, President Clinton suggested that Colin Powell benefited from
affirmative action.  What Colin benefited from, as did I, was a more
level playing field and the opportunity to compete.  Equality in
opportunity is not a racial or gender thing.  It is a basic right,
guaranteed by the Founding Fathers of this nation.  Ensuring that
there is equality in opportunity is a basic and fundamental
responsibility of us all.
<p>
Let me focus for just a moment on the needs of military service for a
solidly educated entering recruit.  The military is becoming
increasingly more complicated.  Computers, highly technical weapon
systems and complicated support structures are now central to
everything the military does.  The better educated the recruit is, the
shorter the training course required to bring him or her up to
proficiency and then--more productive.  Conversely, if the pool from
which the services recruit is less well-educated one, the services
may not be able to recruit enough young men and young women who are
properly prepared, and two, the service will have to extend the length
of time allocated to training courses to take up the slack in
educational equality.
<p>
The military has had to put a quick fix in a system
before, due to educational levels.  For
example, in the 1970s, the Army actually ran high schools for
soldiers.  During that period, the 1st Cavalry Division at Ft.  Hood,
Texas, had the Cavalry Academy, which accounted for about 800
full-time soldiers, student soldiers, each semester, taking high
school-level courses and working on their GED certificates.  You
should be aware that 800 soldiers constitute the equivalent of a
battalion.
<p>
I know this to be true from my personal observation, because I was a
commander of the 1st Cavalry Division in that time period.  We had
some 15,000 soldiers.  There was a price to pay:  an additional unit
training.  These soldiers were not available to their unit during
their school attendance for about four hours each day.  The Army was
in the initial stages of the all-volunteer force, and the educational
quality of some of the recruits could have been better.  We haven't
seen a return to those days yet, but the potential is before us.  We
may reach a point in this country where the quality high school
graduate is so scarce, the military services can't compete.
<p>
Remember, during the days of the Cold War, when [the] Secretary of State
or
the Secretary of Defense or somebody from the White House would make a
pronouncement that such-and-such was in the national interests of the
United States?  Well, in my judgment, education is in the national
interests--security interests--of the United States, and you and I
need to take an interest in the security of United States education.
<p>
Let's look at it another way.  Politicians say that all politics is
local.  I believe all education is local.  And since it is, I believe
the block grant or some similar funding mechanism straight to the
needy school district is the way to go.  An infusion of financial
strength into ailing school districts is the opening shot in this war.
For this to obtain, the Congress should expend its energies in the
educational arena on the big gainers rather than working marginal
issues such as vouchers and so-called scholarships.  In the great
scheme of things, vouchers and scholarship initiative will have
negative effect on solving the big problem in education, which is:
How do we keep from losing another generation?
<p>
Now to put these initiatives in perspective, current voucher thinking,
at least last month, would affect about 2,000 DC public school
students, as opposed to the remainder of the 74,000 in the system.
This will not get us the best return for our educational dollar.  We
really need to rethink our strategy on this.
<p>
In the District of Columbia public schools, we need teachers and
teacher training.  We need a greater capital budget to repair aged
and poorly maintained
buildings, and build new ones, and capitalize new educational support
equipment.  That's what we need, and I suspect the same is true for
disadvantaged and urban school districts throughout the nation.
<p>
So much for my slight excursion from my assigned topic.  These issues
are contemporary, however, and if not forcefully addressed, we have a
negative effect on the quality of our armed forces.  The military
services tend to reflect the best and the brightest this country has
to offer.  Quality education ensures that these best and brightest
entering classes of recruits continue in the future.
<p>
Since the military services have a stake in the outcome of bettering
the education process in this country, the military needs to expand
its support of this process.  During the period of the Cavalry Academy
high school program that I spoke about earlier, each Army division and
large Army units were assigned parts of the United States
as recruiting areas.  The divisions organized recruiting teams out of
hide and worked the areas. <p>

This process should be brought back again
with support of needy school districts taking the place of recruiting
missions of the mid-'70s.  The schools would be supported by
military services, mentoring programs, teacher support, leadership
training and other activities consistent with military expertise.
This program will serve to ensure that the armed forces remain
connected with the country, provide positive role models for some
some of America's neediest youth, and by the very nature of
people in the program, demonstrate to all the strength of diversity.
<p>
Coupled with the foregone, I would like to see a resurgence of Junior
ROTC in this country.  The program gives young people a very different
view of discipline, a feeling of inclusiveness, a connection to
history and a feeling of service to the community.  Junior ROTCs date
back to National Defense Act of 1916.  In its current form, the JROTC
system includes Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force; it is composed of
2,414 ROTC units and more than 380,000 cadets in the entire US
secondary school system.  We need to triple or quadruple that system.
In order to do this, educators need to learn about the system and
embrace it.  I have a fundamental belief that many educators today
have a bias against Junior ROTC programs, and I really don't know why.
I suspect that this may be a concomitant bias against the Senior ROTC
as well.  It may be a holdover from the Vietnam era anti-war feeling.
It may be something else, but it's there.
<p>
If I had my way, there would be a Junior ROTC program in every
inner-city high school in the country and in the other disadvantaged
and underfunded school districts that I spoke of earlier.  This will
require some heavy lifting on the part of the military services and
some equally heavy lifting on the part of school districts'
administration.  I think the payoff would be great.  I can see
firsthand the value of programs we have in the District of Columbia
public schools.  I hear the comment from our youth, and they speak
reverently about one of the instructors in the Naval program--`Well,
Master Gunny said,' and `We need to ask Master Gunny.'
<p>
The program provides role models for the very youth who need it most.
It provides another educational avenue to deliver knowledge to some
who have a hard time finding it, but who need it most.  Junior ROTCs
work to inculcate honesty, integrity and the ethics of selfless
service and a feeling of community involvement.  It also builds spirit
and esprit.  All I see is a win-win situation for our youth.
<p>
And so I come to the last challenge I have set out to describe to you
today, one which may sound trite at first, but one, on reflection, may
be the most daunting task of all.  I believe there is a military model
of ethical values which, if properly defined and linked to community,
educational and commercial business issues, could generate a
renaissance of ethical thought and practice in this country.  All
contemporary polls and rankings of institutions within society that
I've seen places the military services toward the top of the scale.
The military services generally is viewed in a positive light.  Its
core values are, I think, the reason for this.  `Duty, honor, country'
illustrate the basics of this ethic.
<p>
Almost everyone in America, at one time or other, has heard or seen
`Duty, honor, country,' and has a basic understanding of what the
implication of these three words are to the military.  But these same
people tend to view these implications in the abstract.  They resist
internalizing the ethical values embodied in the trio, a system of
ethical values internalized by the general population, understood and
supported, nurtured and taught, defended and exported, a system of
values in which all can believe and embrace.  We need to find a way to
embrace a self-interest.
<p>
There is a superb book making the rounds today, written by two old
friends of mine, Gordon Sullivan and Mike Harper.  The name of the
book is "Hope Is Not a Method." Gordon Sullivan, retired Army
four-star, who was the chief of staff of the Army from 1991 to 1995;
Mike Harper, a retired colonel, who was the director of the chief
staff group, a brain trust for the Army chief.  The book contains a
wealth of information for business leaders and others, especially for
those organizations undergoing change.  For me, however, most
important was the superb way in which the authors cover the importance
of values.
<p>
And speaking of values with respect to organizations, the authors
said, `Values give an organization a self-ordering quality, a kind of
organizational ballast which provides direction and stability in
periods of turmoil, stress and change.' What a superb, crisp, clearly
understandable definition of values.  One can easily and quickly
paraphrase their definition to relate to a society as a whole, such
as, `Values give society a self-ordering quality, which provides it
with direction and stability in periods of turmoil, stress and
change.'
<p>
The military, as an institution, needs to work the values issue
carefully and continuously.  The Department of Defense should get out
front and work with media and educational establishments in a public
discussion of values and ethics.  This proposition has a great deal of
risk inherent in it, since many--and, I suspect, some in this
room--have a skeptical view of anything military.  But the issues are
clear and the task difficult.
<p>
In his masterpiece, the "Story of Civilization," Will Durant begins
with an opening--with outlining in volume one, chapter one, the
conditions of civilization.  He indicates that civilization is social
order promoting cultural creation.  He says that four elements
constitute civilization.  They are economic provision, political
organization, moral--tradition and the pursuit of knowledge and
the arts.
<p>
He expands moral tradition into ethical imperatives for civilization,
and he defines for us a relationship between race and civilization,
one which I think you'll find interesting.  Durant advanced the theory
in 1935 that, and I quote:  "There are no racial conditions to
civilization.  It is not the great race that makes the civilization;
it's the great civilization that makes the people create a culture.
The Englishman does not make British civilization; it makes him." He,
in my judgment, was right on course.
<p>
Durant goes on to say that `This appearance of any of the conditions
of civilization may destroy the civilization.' But one of the most
profound writings which I've found in any book, and especially in the
11 volumes of Durant's "Story of Civilization," is his basic
definition of civilization, and I quote:  "Civilizations are the
generations of the racial soul.  As family rearing and then writing
bound the generations together, handing down the lore of the dying to
the young, so print and commerce and a thousand ways of communication
may bind a civilization together, and preserve for future cultures all
that is of value for them in their own.  Let us
begin"--"Let us before we die gather up our heritage and offer it to
our children.  Man differs from the beast only by education, which may
be defined as the technique of transmitting civilization."
<p>
The transmission of knowledge and values assured a viability of
civilization.  We need to work both.  In transmitting core values, we
invest in our civilization.  Knowledge wraps around
it all, and knowledge comes through education and experience.  While
experience is a sometime game of chance, we cannot leave
education to chance.
<p>
And so, at the end of this long journey--and as I promised, I've taken
a few excursions outside my theme box--but I think--at least, I
hope--I made it back on task.  I appreciate your patience.  You have
my recommendations.  What are your questions?
