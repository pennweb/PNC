The first plenary meeting of the Penn National Commission on
Society, Culture and Community was held December 9-10, 1996 at the
University of Pennsylvania.  The <a href=decsessions.html>meeting
sessions</a>
were intended primarily to trigger vigorous roundtable discussion among
members of the Commission, and two days of thoughtful and stimulating
discussion ensued.  <p>

The Commission's discussions reflected a general consensus that much of
the ideological extremism, oversimplification, and polarization of
contemporary public culture, as well as the thoughtlessness of social
behaviors, the lack of strong leadership, and the tendency towards the
super-fragmentation of communities, may be the result of the intrusion of
mass market forces and values (or extreme reactions against them) into
areas of social, cultural, and political life from which they were
formerly, largely absent.  The rise of "politics as entertainment" and the
exaggeration of the media's delegitimizing roles are obvious symptoms of
this impact, but so too are the development of a "culture of immediacy"
and the blurring of traditional lines between public and private spheres.
Abroad, the advent of a global market and ubiquitous global communications
(or reactions against them) have played a major role in the resurgence of
nationalism, tribalism, and religious fundamentalism.
<p>
        The Commission believes that given the relative permanence and
enormous power of these market forces and values, movement towards greater
civility and constructive engagement in public discourse and greater
comity in social interactions must focus on the context in which such
forces operate, a context shaped by the nature of contemporary
communities, the effectiveness of their leadership, and the culture of
behavior they foster.  Working groups of
Commission members have
been
formed to explore these areas, which will be the focus of
future plenary
meetings of the Commission, in greater depth.
