<p>
TOM LUCE:  It's my pleasure to introduce our next presenter
for our ongoing discussion and it's rather strange in that I feel like
I met Senator Bradley in 1965.  Now I must say he has no recollection
of this, but I actually met him when a splendid writer by the name of
John McPhee introduced me to him in his book "A Sense of Where You
Are." McPhee, who I believe can bring alive any subject from oranges
to geology to bark, in 1965, brought alive to me a young man, a
then-young man by the name of Bill Bradley, who was a young student
athlete.  And John McPhee described him as an all-American basketball
player from Princeton, of all places, who was setting scoring records,
but who wrote his student thesis on Harry Truman's senatorial campaign
and who many sportswriters were then prophesying would be president of
the United States in 25 years.
<p>
Senator Bradley did, following the book, go on to become a Rhodes
scholar at Oxford, where he earned a graduate degree after studying
politics and philosophy and economics.  Won a gold medal in Olympic
basketball and played pro basketball on the famous 1973 New York
Knicks team that won an NBA championship.  In 1978, he began to
fulfill John McPhee's prophesy when he was elected senator from New
Jersey.  While he was in the Senate for 18 years, he focused on tax
policy, honest budgeting, economic competitiveness and racial issues.
His discussion on the Senate floor on racial issues in this country
was a highlight of modern Senate debate and a true example of a robust
discussion that contributed to the national community.
<p>
I had the pleasure, finally, of meeting Senator Bradley in person in
Dallas in 1989 when he was traveling the country focusing attention on
the then-international debt crisis.  His cogent and straightforward
discussion of this difficult international economic issue was very
impressive.  Ever since, I've followed his career with interest and
admiration.  His recent autobiography, "Time Present, Time Past," only
enhanced my respect for him.
<p>
John McPhee said Bill Bradley had a sense of where he was on a
basketball court, thus the title of his book.  But I feel Bill Bradley
has a sense of where we are as a nation as well.  When he resigned
from the Senate in 1995, he said he wanted to help improve the
nation's political dialogue.  He said, and I quote, "On a basic level,
politics is broken.  Neither major US political party speaks to people
where they lead their lives." He said he wanted to focus on how to
take the corrosive impact of money out of our political system.  For
all of these reasons, we could not have a better presenter for our
next topic of how we can develop a more robust and diverse public
discourse than former Senator Bill Bradley.  Please join me in
welcoming him to our group.
<p>
BILL BRADLEY:  I really know I'm speaking to a very
important group when I have a podium that goes up.  So I want to tell
you what a pleasure it is to be here today, and to have a chance to
address you.  A sportswriting prophet is probably one of the better
descriptions of an oxymoron that I know.  But I'm very pleased
that you mentioned my recent book.  It is still available.
<p>
And I'm pleased to be here today to be the presenter for this segment
of today's deliberations.  And this segment is supposed to deal with
the question of what government can do to meliorate the increased
polarization and intolerance characteristic of so many contemporary
exchanges in the public realm, while supporting the development of a
robust and diverse public discourse.  I'm taking this to mean
not simply government, but I'm taking it to mean politics as well as
government.  And that's what I've prepared my remarks to deal with.
<p>
During the years that I spent in the United States Senate, when young
people visited Washington on a school trip and asked me what they
should do in the time they were here, I usually encouraged them to go
 down to the Lincoln and the Jefferson memorials, particularly
 the Jefferson Memorial at night, taking enough time to read the 
inscriptions on the wall and to read and to really absorb
them.  And I made this pilgrimage myself, occasionally alone.  I
remember one night I took an out-of-town guest to the Jefferson Memorial
and I was coming out and ran into Byron White, then a Supreme Court
justice, who was taking his group of out-of-towners to visit the
Jefferson Memorial at midnight.
<p>
From a new book on the Declaration of Independence by Pauline Maier,
we now know how the words came to be what they are.  In May of 1941,
as the commission was meeting, they were talking about what the
inscription 
was going to be on the walls of the Jefferson Memorial.  And an excerpt
from the
Declaration of Independence was suggested, beginning with the second
paragraph--'We
hold these truths to be self-evident'--through the sentence in which
Jefferson affirms that when government fails to meet its ends, quote,
"it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it."
<p>
Now FDR looked at this suggestion from the commission and decided
that's not what he wanted.  So he jumped ahead to the end of the
inscription with the words that end the entire Declaration of
Independence, which are 'for the support of this declaration, with a
firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually
pledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.' Well, he was
president, of course, and it was the phrase that he preferred from
among all of the words that might have been chosen in the Declaration
and so because he was the president, he got the words that he wanted
on the walls of the Jefferson Memorial.
<p>
But I think that his decision highlights a long-standing tension about
the place of trust in a democracy and in this democracy in particular.
Do we treat government as a temporary expedient to be altered or
abolished when it fails to work as expected or do we pledge ourselves
to wish for divine protection and throw in our lives and our honor?
It was a question taken up in the Federalist Papers.  It was, of
course, a big part of--a part, at least, of what the Civil War was
about, and it arose in the Progressive Era.  And I believe that it's a
question that we should be thinking about more openly today.
<p>
In recent years, we seem to have forgotten the reality that our
government is not as it was for Jefferson in 1776--some exploitive
power on the other side of the ocean--but the government, our
government, is simply ourselves.  I've always believed that the
message of America is that if you work hard you can get ahead
economically.  If you get involved, you can change things politically.
And if you reason patiently enough, you can extend equality to all
races and both genders.
<p>
Today many Americans doubt these basic American precepts:  In the
information economy, before computer workstations replaced 300
people in the credit department, no matter how hard they work.  In our
political dialogue, money drowns out the voices of the people too
often.  In our social interactions, few risk candor to try to create a
deeper racial harmony.
<p>
On some levels our political process is at a standstill.  Democrats
and Republicans both march along the well-worn paths of symbolic
politics, waving flags labeled `welfare,' `crime,' `taxes,' to divide
Americans and win elections.  Republicans cling to the illusion that
government is the problem, even the enemy of freedom, and that less
government and free markets will automatically relieve fears of
working Americans.  Democrats, on the other hand, cling to old
programs like worker retraining, without ever stopping to ask whether
those fragmented programs are actually working to change lives for the
better or whether jobs are available for the workers that we're
retraining.  Underlying the paralysis of government, I think, is a
collapse of trust and a rising polarization.
<p>
Politicians lob negative TV ads and campaigns that are richly
financed by special interests and wealthier Americans, and a
growing part of the American electorate becomes disinterested.
Witness in 1996 less than half of those eligible even thought it was
worth voting for the president of the United States of either party.
So democracy is paralyzed and polarized not just because politicians
are needlessly partisan.  The process is broken at a deeper level and
it won't be fixed by replacing one set of elected officials with
another any more than it was fixed in 1992, 1994 or 1996.  Citizens at
a very gut level believe that politicians are controlled by
special interests who give them money, by parties which crush their
independence, by ambition for higher office that makes them hedge
their positions rather than call it like they really see it, and by
pollsters who convince them that only the focus group phrase
can guarantee them victory.  Thought is a risky endeavor.
<p>
Citizens affected by the choices we have to make about spending and
regulation simply don't trust that the choice was made fairly or
independently, or in some cases even democratically.  They doubt that
the facts will determine the result, much less the honest convictions
of the politicians.  Voters distrust government so deeply and so
consistently that they are not willing to accept the results of
virtually any decision made by this political process.
<p>
A little personal story:  In 1990 I tried to tell the people of New
Jersey that the Tax Reform Act of 1986, of which I was one of the
architects, reduced their federal taxes by $1 billion a year, because
it did.  Yet they didn't believe me because state and local tax
increases offset the reduction.  Well, by the time I left the Senate,
constituents were routinely calling to ask how I voted on a particular
bill, and when my office told them the vote hadn't even occurred yet,
they didn't believe it, because some radio talk show host had said
otherwise.
<p>
For nearly a decade, beginning roughly with the repeal of catastrophic
health-care legislation in 1989, through the erosion of environmental
laws, to the failure of health-care reform and the backlash against the
budget in 1995, every major step government has taken has been
jeopardized by this mistrust, by a deep and widespread conviction that
politicians are acting in their own individual interests, rather than
acting as honest representatives of the democratic will.  And while
there are plenty hard-working, honest politicians who strive to
understand their time and then act on principle, the public impression
of politicians is generally negative.  In part, because we refuse to
reform a system that produces little change in people's real-life
circumstances.
<p>
It is possible, though unlikely, that the budget agreement of 1997
marks a change in this climate of mistrust.  For the first time in
years, Democrats and Republicans were able to find the points on which
they agreed, and yet the agreement itself is of little consequence.
Big issues were not decided and the political climate is no less
polarized.  Government estimators simply came in with new projections
of economic growth that suddenly allowed both parties to claim victory
and avoid the tough decisions.  It seems unlikely that this will form
a precedent for further action.  And, indeed, there seems little else
on which such common ground will be found in Congress.  Witness the
debacle this year on campaign finance reform.
<p>
Further, the budget agreement itself embodied all the forces that have
caused the kind of mistrust that cripples democracy.  From the role of
money in politics--just take a look at the tax bill and the special
favors in that tax bill--to the influence of a media that is more
interested in personal intrigue and celebrity than in giving citizens
the information they need to participate effectively.  Well,
does this kind of politics deserve our trust, I guess is the
first question.  Mistrust is a corrosive force in
American democracy, but it is also appropriate in certain
circumstances.  The first circumstance is money, the first ground for
mistrust.
<p>
To be in politics today, even for the noblest ends, means that a part
of your processional life must be devoted to raising money.  Fine
public servants are stuck in a bad system.  In fact, money drives
politics in America in a way that it never has before, even in its
darkest moments.  We've reached a point where nothing but money seems
to matter.  Political parties have lost their original purpose, which
was to bring people together with broadly similar views from the
precinct level to the national level, and instead they become
primarily conduits for cash--not cash, actually, but money. 
<p>
National membership organizations measure their clout, not by how many
members they have, but by how much money they can put into the
political process, so-called political action committees, etc.  Anyone
interested in running for any office, on approaching party leaders or
consultants, will be asked, `How much can you raise?' Or better yet,
`How much do you have?' And, `How much of that are you willing to
spend?'
<p>
And those questions are asked before questions such as, `Do you have
the support of the community?  Do you have experience that would help
you serve in this office?  What ideas do you have about the major
problems that confront America?' Many good people can't run for office
and those who do find themselves doing little other than raising money
and spending more time with those who can finance their campaigns than
with those they would represent.
<p>
For example, in 1994, I was visited in my office in the Senate by a
Democrat who was running for the Senate in a particular state--he was
running against a Republican, who I thought had had it cinched.  But he
wanted to talk, so I said, `Please, come over.' And in the first
 couple of minutes, he said, `You know I'm gonna win this campaign,' 
which is not the unusual opening comment of a challenger.  And I said, 
`Well, why do you think you've got a chance?  He's a pretty tough, 
entrenched senator.' He said, `Because I could raise money.' I said, 
`What do you mean?' He said, `Well, from January to August'--
and it was now August--`I have sat in a room with two great staff people
 for six hours a day  and they would hand me the names of people 
I don't know with telephone numbers and I would call and ask them 
cold for money. I can do that and so far we've called over 3,422 people.  
I'm gonna win.' Of course, he didn't win.  But the point is 
that's how he was spending his time and that is how a lot of other 
politicians spend their time during election years.
<p>
It's not just that there is too much money in politics.  Keep that in
mind.  All the campaigns for president, House and Senate, in 1996, put
together, spent about $17 for every American who voted.  This amount
could hardly be excessive if it provided useful information, if it was
distributed fairly, and if it came without strings attached.  Indeed,
many citizens would gladly pay $17 for useful, balanced information
that would help them decide who should represent them.  Just in your
own experience, ask yourself, what have you paid $17 for in the last
month?  Did you go to the movies with your family?  Will you pay
enough for information about who should be president of the United
States as you would pay to take your family to the movies, is that
basic question.
<p>
But look at the reality--and remember it's not just too much money,
but look at the reality of what money in politics pays for, how it is
distributed and the effect it has on elected officials.  It is spent
in roughly equal amounts on three things:  raising more money;
consultants and polls; and 30-second television advertisements.
That's the triumvirate.  Sometimes the ads are vicious wars that
portray opposing candidates not just as undeserving of public office,
but as unworthy to walk on the face of the Earth.  There is some
reason to think that negative ads may even be designed to turn voters
off, to reduce turn-out, to the advantage of the candidate who might
benefit from a lower turn-out.
<p>
Certainly, one way that government and politicians can reduce
polarization in the public realm is for politicians to stop calling
each other names, stop attacking each other's character, and, frankly,
what it's gonna take in order for this to happen is for someone to win
in a new way, to win by not doing that.  Because now all the
consultants tell you--and one critical moment when you as the
candidate as the ultimate person in charge of your campaign must make
the decision--`Well, you know, Senator, Congressman, Challenger X, Mr.
Y, Mrs.  Y, if you don't want to go ahead with this negative ad, go
ahead and lose.  Be stupid.  It's your decision.  Do you want to be a
congressman, senator, governor, or not?  I mean, we know.  We've done
this before.' What it'll take is for someone to say, `No, I don't want
to do that.  I want to do it this other way,' and win and then
politics, not being the most original of all sciences, everybody will
be imitating the new way.
<p>
In fact, this has reached a point, though, where it's kind of a macho
world.  `Gun fight at media corral' I call it--to refuse the negative
commercial is thought not only stupid, but a judgment on how tough you
are.  Well, I would say tough, if you're gonna go negative, is looking
into the camera and calling your opponent an SOB, rather than having
artful advertisers design the special ad mechanism and special
effects that would allow you to do it and pay for it, but accept very
little responsibility because your name wouldn't quite be attached to
it.
<p>
So even when the advertisements are not negative, though, or designed
to foster mistrust, 30 seconds is rarely enough time to provide useful
information for voters or foster the sense of confidence and trust
that one should have in a representative.  The way political money is
distributed is also guaranteed to make voters doubt a basic premise of
democracy, which is that their vote matters.  Money does not need to
be equal for an election to be competitive, but candidates do need to
have enough to get a message across about who they are and what they
stand for.  More than 40 percent of the members of the House of
Representatives, however, outspent their opponents by more than ten to one
and no candidate for the House who spent less than 20 percent of what
his opponent spent, actually won.  Money goes to incumbents, it goes to
certain challengers opposing incumbents who've been targeted for
defeat by special interests, and it goes to candidates who have a lot
of money of their own or have a lot of wealthy friends.
<p>
If an election has only one candidate who meets one of these criteria,
it's likely to be a competitive election.  And in a sense, it
won't be a competitive election and your vote won't matter.  In
a nation which prides itself on the principle of `one person, one
vote,' money gives some people much more clout than one vote.
<p>
Finally, money fosters mistrust through the political process because
it comes with strings attached that either in perception or reality,
and we never know quite which, distort representatives' votes and
their priorities.  Campaign finance reformers often become obsessed
with distinctions among different sources of money--political action
committees, political party soft money, individual contributions,
etc.  They lose sight of the fact that some money, whatever channel it
comes through, comes with strings attached.  It's also clear that many
contributors make contributions based not on their political
conviction but on the influence they believe they will gain by
contributing.
<p>
How else to explain the numerous companies that give soft money to
both political parties.  How else do we explain the shift in PAC
contributions to Republicans after Republicans took control of
Congress in '94, then back to Democrats after the Republican
juggernaut collapsed, then back to Republicans after they regained
control?  What else explains contributors who give to one candidate in
a race in May when the candidate is ahead, then to his opponent in
September after the tide has shifted?  Opponents of campaign finance
reform, like the Supreme Court in its 1976 decision, Buckley-Valeo,
tend to speak of political contributions as if they were the same as
political speech and deserve the same protection.  But the reality in
patterns of giving suggests that they have far less to do with
expressing political opinions than with investing in influence.
<p>
As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I often noted obscure tax
favors which just happened to appear in legislation before our
committee.  Occasionally I wondered whether there was a connection
between these gifts and campaign contributions.  When I identified a
specific instance, usually my former colleague would protest,
often convincingly, that in every case they vote and set priorities
based on their conscience, the needs of their state and what they
think is the interests of their constituents, and not money.  And,
personally, I think it's very rare, perhaps never, that a member of
Congress consciously thinks `I know the right vote on this
amendment, but, no, it's probably no good for the folks in my
district, but, you know, even though I know what's the right vote
and it's probably no good for my district, I'm gonna go ahead and
vote because the guy who's pushing it raised $100,000 for me the last
time.  So I'll vote for it.'
<p>
So--and yet the unavoidable reality is that Congress is far more
attentive to the corporation demanding relief from the alternative
minimum tax than to the family looking for help to pay for escalating
health costs.  It is more responsive to investors seeking a reduction
in the tax rate on capital gains than to working parents who would
like a reduction in their own tax rate.  It may be that these are not
favors in return for contributions, but simply a side-effect of the
amount of time spent raising money so that representatives only know
one side of any story because they spend so much time with their
contributors.
<p>
A company well-known for flying members of Congress around in its
planes, for example, persuaded its friends to tie up the Senate for
almost a week in 1996 fighting for an obscure change that would help
the company keep labor unions out.  What, were the senators returning 
a favor?  Or was it just that they spent so many hours in planes with the 
company's executives that they came to think the company's problems 
were their own problems?
<p>
The problem is we'll never know which.  We don't know whether
politicians genuinely believe that the alternative minimum tax is an
unreasonable burden or simply intend to repay contributors.  We can't
know whether money or conscience governs the priorities
they set.  If we could figure out exactly how money distorts the
political process, it could be self-correcting.  The conservative
argument that the only campaign finance reform needed
is enhanced disclosure would be correct in that voters could identify
contributors, identify political favors, and vote against candidates
who put contributors' interests above the constituents.
<p>
But they can't.  It doesn't work that way.  We can't figure out what's
a favor and what isn't, and as a result the only reasonable response
is mistrust.  Campaign finance reform can potentially restore some of
the trust that is needed for democracy to work, but only if the reform
is clear and simple and complete enough that voters can really see how
it would change the nature of politics.  If reform means just one more
set of complicated rules that the party fund-raising experts will find
clever ways to evade, it will only deepen the sense that government
can't even solve its own problems.
<p>
Nothing about the role of money in politics would anger people as much
as it does, however, if government seemed to be able to respond to the
economic circumstances of non-wealthy Americans.  Through the
recession of the early 1990s the government was unable to restructure
unemployment benefits in a way that helped people survive stretches of
a year or more without a job.  After the recession ended and a period
of corporate downsizing accelerated, government was once again unable
even to acknowledge that the forces that would make us better off in
the long run endangered many Americans in the short run.
<p>
Now that the economy's healthier and we're reaping some but not all
the benefits of this corporate restructuring, the fact remains that
when times are tough, government is no longer anywhere to be found.
And when times are good, government seems eager to reduce taxes for
investors more than to think about investing in the long-term economic
security of families whose income will come from work and not from
capital gains.
<p>
Even with a healthy economy, there are profound problems.  Millions of
Americans work part-time who want to work full-time, even more without
health insurance, etc.  Until government begins to show some ability
to respond to the economic anxieties about both the present and the
future that are on the minds of most American families, it's not
unreasonable for them to mistrust that government.
<p>
To the extent that the news media is a part of a democratic system of
government--in both Jefferson's theory and our reality--and it
is--the press, too, has failed to provide the kind of confidence that
Americans need to be constructive, participating citizens.  As with
money-driven political campaigns, television is the common
denominator, the one media outlet that reaches the broad majority of
citizens.  Yet local television news is governed by the motto:  If it
bleeds, it leads; if it thinks, it stinks.  And all but ignores the
significance of local representatives and the deliberations that lead
to legislation that affects human lives.
<p>
Every few months the media reports with disdain some polls showing
that most Americans can't name their member of Congress, with no hint
of self-consciousness that the press itself takes an interest in those
members only when they become embroiled in scandal, celebrity or
personal intrigue.  A few politicians, like House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, have taken temporary advantage of the media's fascination
with eccentric celebrity, personal conflict and Machiavellian
intrigue, and discovered how painfully temporary it is.  But the
majority of members of Congress toil in obscurity, knowing that
neither their accomplishments nor their shortcomings will attract the
camera's eye.
<p>
Nor when it comes to elections does the media add the kind of
information that voters need to counter the misinformation of paid
television advertising.  The press remains mesmerized by the
horserace--who's ahead, who's behind, how vicious the conflict has
become.  An ordinary campaign between two or more people with
distinguished careers of competent service, respect for one another,
and differing but not extreme political views, is likely to receive so
little coverage that voters cannot but doubt that such elections and
such politicians exist.  Indeed, the media even magnifies the effect
of negative ads.  Under the high-minded pretext of examining the tone
of the campaign itself, they often rebroadcast a negative ad several
times free.  And don't think that political consultants don't know
that.  The more outrageous they get, the more they can use the free
media to magnify their message.
<p>
To be fair to the media, theirs is a vast, diverse enterprise.
Although concentration of ownership makes it smaller and less diverse
every day, with more than a few bright spots of careful and relevant
reporting amid the depressing sameness.  Further, the media in recent
years has developed a little bit of self-consciousness about its
shortcomings and its responsibilities, leading to experiments much like
the criticized public 
journalism initiative.  One wonders, though, why the idea of
systematically
providing citizens with information that is most useful to them in
doing the work of democracy should be considered an experiment as
opposed to the normal course of activity.
<p>
Now what can big government do here?  Well, government can highlight,
carefully, in prepared hearings, where the media might be falling
short.  After all, they are licensed, if they're television stations,
by the federal government.  The media reviews politicians.  Why can't
politicians review the media in a careful and serious way?  If you do
negative ads, however, you're a little less credible when you're the
chairman of the committee.  If you don't, you have a little more
credibility.  And the other thing politicians can do is themselves
speak out civilly in moments of crisis to demonstrate what civil
language can do in a moment where people are truly looking for advice,
opinion and leadership.
<p>
Although the political system bears responsibility for much of the
public's mistrust of it, it's fair to say that the mistrust is
actually far out of proportion to the failings of the system itself.
Mistrust has become a political commodity itself.  The emergence of
mistrust is a political commodity.  It goes hand-in-glove with the
increasing domination of political discourse by interest groups that
are not only contributors to political candidates, but increasingly
act like political parties themselves, dominating the information that
flows between government and citizens, controlling perception, taking
over the grassroots of politics through direct mail, talk radio,
phone and fax networks.
<p>
You know, take the period '93-96.  There had been a serious bipartisan
effort to consolidate several hundred job-training programs funded by
the federal government into a few simple programs, including one or
two block grants to states.  Everybody agreed on this in Congress and
it was about to pass.  Then phone calls started coming in, and they
were really ginned up by something called Eagle Forum.  It had put out
the word through its network that Congress was about to consider
legislation under which bureaucrats, Soviet-style, would tell each
child what his or her occupation was to be.  The charge was completely
made up.  It had nothing at all to do with anything that was in the
legislation as several of the more conservative supporters of the
job-training legislation have made clear.  But the phone calls from
outraged parents, determined to protect their children's American
right to choose to make a living any way they saw fit, were enough to
scare Congress away.
<p>
After the crime bill and the 1994 budget crisis, members
knew that if it was their word against the interest groups--remember
the call to my office saying, `How'd you vote on the thing?' and the
vote hadn't been taken?--they might as well be talking to their dog.
Well, what was going on here?  My hunch is the Eagle Forum had
little interest in the job-training bill.  They were simply using it
as a way to generate members and contributions to the Eagle Forum.
Mistrust in this way can breed deeper mistrust and mistrust can even
leave citizens more vulnerable to deception.  Just as few politicians
are steered too often by money, the citizens they're trying to
represent are steered just as often by the clutter of interest groups
making it all the more difficult for elected officials to see and to
follow the path of the true public interest.
<p>
Each of us has a multitude of identities, opinions, interests and
connections to others.  But interest groups try to take our voices and
turn them into single-minded protests on behalf of the most narrow
identity--gun owner, senior, pro-choice, small-businessperson,
environmentalist, smoker.  Each of these groups and many others clamor
to speak for us in Washington, Sacramento, Trenton, but for most of us
no group can represent us in our fullness as citizens with all our
interests and opinions.  That we can only do for ourselves in a
setting of lively and varied debate where we have plenty of
opportunity to engage.
<p>
But as citizens withdraw from these varied and local forums, they have
not withdrawn from participation altogether, but shifted their
engagement into mass-mailing-driven organizations that can only
operate in a certain way.  They seek to convince us not that some of
our interests and opinions are in conflict, nor that some of our
ideals require compromise, but simply that we are not getting what we
want from government because government itself is corrupt, dishonest,
out of control, controlled by corporate interests or controlled by
those dependent on the welfare state, dominated by liberals, or
dominated by conservatives.  They don't help us think of ourselves as
citizens who are part of a democratic dialogue or think of government
as something of which we're a part and have the power to change.
<p>
In the end, our democracy is losing its most essential ingredient, and
that is the willingness of citizens to accept the results of the
process itself, especially if they're not complete winners.  Driven by
groups whose professional survival depends on endless fight, citizens
are discouraged from accepting that they might be in the minority on a
particular question or that they need to compromise their positions
with others whose interests are different.  They're told again and
again that corruption drives the process, that choices that appear to
be made democratically are, in fact, authoritarian will of an outside
force called government.  And the objective of the special interest
groups is to win, at any cost.  Interest groups are by definition
intolerant.  They polarize to win.  They rarely if ever think of the
whole.  And that's OK unless the whole political debate then becomes
nothing more than a cacophony of interest groups, many of which
practice their meanness in ways that demean the political process.
<p>
Well, if things continue as they are, mistrust eats away at every
pillar of democracy, at elections which are distorted by money and
represent a democracy because citizens rightly perceive, on occasion,
the influence of money that eats away at not only the larger idea of
an open system of government that can make fair decisions for all of
us, but even undermines the core notion of our democracy:  That
legitimacy rests with individuals who are citizens and it should be
promoted to the best will of the people themselves.  If things
continue as they are, Americans' doubts about their own government
will eventually leave that government completely marginal to
just about every aspect of life.
<p>
Already government seems barely relevant to most of the issues that
concern us.  We have quite complacently given up the idea that
government can protect us from the ravages of the economic cycle, or
that it might systematically protect very poor mothers and their
children from the extremes of poverty.  The less we're capable of
trusting government, the more we leave our most personal choices 
about family, education and community to the market.  Because the 
market, unlike democracy, does not require trust to exist. 
 It simply exists.
<p>
Well, what to do about this?  Emerson once said that the new is the seat
of the old.  And I think that I would say the best way to deal with
this is to think about the United States Senate as an institution and
how it functions and then to draw from that a lesson.  When a number
of senators announced in 1996 they were not going to run for re-election,
I being one of them, at countless public forums the question was
asked:  `Well, how can you abandon--it's the moderate center that's
leaving the Senate--how can you leave the Senate to the extremes?' And
my answer was:  `The Senate does not reward the extremes.'
<p>
You assume somebody comes to the Senate to exercise power.  That is
exercised in the middle.  So if people leave who are in the middle,
others will fill the middle because without people in the middle,
power can't be executed.  It's only the power to stop.  The power to
make things happen is always in the middle.  And, therefore, I'm not
arguing that politicians should shy away from disagreeing, but that
they should disagree civilly.  In the Senate in its best moments, that
is precisely how things work.
<p>
And I also would point out that there are other hopeful signs on the
horizon.  People across the country are waking up to the role of money
in politics.  The Common Cause has run a program now trying to get
people involved in getting petitions--over 50,000 petitioners were
carrying over a million signatures.  The media is continuing its long
self-examination, and meanwhile new channels of political
communication and honest deliberation are emerging every day.
The Internet is a very good example of that.  And people across the
country are also seeing that, ultimately, if they don't assert
themselves, the process will further stagnate.
<p>
If the era of mistrust comes to an end, it will be
because it is followed by an era of reform, comparable in its scope,
daring in imagination to the Progressive Era.  It will require
rethinking of some of the basic premises of American democracy, such
as:  What is the role of political parties?  What is the right balance
between freedom of expression and the corruption and narrow choices of
money-driven political campaigns?  How should representative
institutions be structured to give everyone a voice?  How can
technology give citizens access to unmediated, useful information and
open deliberation about solutions?  What are the obligations of the
media, especially the broadcast media to democratic participation?
<p>
Questions like these, rather than the narrow questions about which
political party bureaucrat skirted the campaign rules most
aggressively, have the potential to help us finally understand why we
mistrust government so deeply, to give the political process a way to
earn back some of that trust that it has lost and to give citizens the
means to put trust in government again.  The purpose is not
necessarily to restore activist government, but to restore the sense
that government is the creation of the people and not the creation of
an outside force acting upon all of our lives.  Thank you.
