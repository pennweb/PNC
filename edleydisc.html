MICHAEL SANDEL:  Chris, I have a question...
<p>
CHRISTOPHER EDLEY:  Is that Michael?
<p>
SANDEL:  Yes.  Hi.
<p>
EDLEY:  Hi.  I'm sorry.  My vision is--I'm getting old, but
I recognize the voice.  Hi.
<p>
SANDEL:  I thought I detected a difference between the talk you
gave, which I thought was terrific and which was a subtle and
sophisticated and nuanced account of the different positions on
affirmative action...
<p>
EDLEY:  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.
<p>
SANDEL:  ...and difference between the talk you gave and the talk
that Paul advertised.  The talk Paul advertised was about how the
debate over affirmative action exemplifies the culture of intolerance.
And he talked about examples of the culture intolerance ranging from
rude drivers on the highways to ugliness in political discourse.
<p>
And I was wondering what kind of talks that would be, whether that
implied that people who'd disagree with affirmative action are
themselves exemplars of the culture of intolerance or what exactly
what the fit was.  Now I understand why Paul advertised it that
way because we're trying, in this conference, to discuss the
public culture.  But the talk you gave seemed, as I heard it, as I
understood it, to be a model analysis of the way in which the debate
about affirmative action and the disagreements over affirmative action
reflect exactly what political debates should reflect--competing moral
visions, competing empirical perceptions, different
outlooks on society. <p>

In fact, the debate about affirmative action--and you sketched
these different views, these different moral positions--the range, the
nuances between them, the absolute and categorical views which are
principled in their own way--the clashing and contending and the
more complicated views that weigh practical and empirical effects
against moral costs.  What you told us in the debate that
you described seems a shining exception to the debased public
discourse that we find in preoccupations with Paula Jones or the
fare of Geraldo Rivera, and all that stuff that we're here wringing
our hands about and trying to find alternatives to.
<p>
So am I right to interpret your talk about affirmative action as
really calling into question the sense in which that debate, in
constitutional law, in California, in President Clinton's
review--isn't this an example of--isn't this debate far from an
exemplification of the culture of intolerance, an example of the kind
of deep moral and political disagreements that properly play
themselves out in our public culture?
<p>
EDLEY:  No.  First of all, I have to plead guilty to
not being directly on point to your enterprise.  That's because I only
have a vague sense of what your enterprise is.
But let me try to at least draw a dotted line.
<p>
When people scream at each other, enraged, in front of a
birth control clinic--abortion clinic--that, too, is a manifestation
of a deep and important moral argument.  So I think it's important not
to confuse whatever intellectual structure we might seek to impose on
a debate with the actual manner in which the debate is conducted.  I
do think that the debate on affirmative action and race does show
problems with civic culture of the sort you describe.  And I
guess I viewed my speech as sort of implicitly a critique of what I
take to be rather apparent, in the way in which the discussions of
racial issues have proceeded in this country--that is to say my
criticism is that when we engage in the sound bite battles over
discrimination, we are evading more serious and constructive
engagement over this underlying disagreement about how one defines
discrimination.
<p>
So what I'm saying, in a
way, is that part of the antidote to the unhelpful and unhappy
characteristics of civic discourse on race--one of the antidotes is, I
think, to fill out everyone's appreciation of what the deeper
structure of empirical and value dissidence is and to
address our disagreements by addressing that deeper structure of
disagreement related to empirical and value propositions.
<p>
I'm sorry.  So let me--let me try to--was that clear enough?  No.
<p>
SANDEL:  Well, it's clear, but the things that...
<p>
EDLEY:  It's long.  OK.
<p>
SANDEL:  ...you teased out--no, it's...
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.
<p>
SANDEL:  Well, you teased out exactly the right range, it seems to
me, of positions underlying these debates.  And we can never expect
public debate to be as sort of clear and well-worked-out and
transparent about its underlying assumptions as a discussion in a
setting like this or in the sort of deft, sophisticated way
that you have developed this.  So it will always be, at best, public
discourse will be an approximation, a gesturing, a groping toward the
kind of nuanced sort of elaboration that you've given.
<p>
EDLEY:  I'm with you.
<p>
SANDEL:  But is it like--even the people screaming at each
other in front of the abortion clinics--is that a
phenomenon that's sociologically or morally like or analogous,
even, to rude drivers on the road screaming at each other?  I doubt
it. <p>

EDLEY:  I doubt it, too.  I doubt it, too.  But let me add one other
factor that
clearly is going on.  What is the possibility of deconstructing the heated
debate over race so that clarifying the debate over race so that we can
understand what is real--let me--my intellectual aesthetic is to take
the problem and not simply say, `Well, here's my answer,' but instead
to say, `OK.  Here's the problem.  What is the dispute?  What's
the nature of the disagreement here,' first.  Second, `Why is that the
disagreement?  You know, why is that the term?  Why are those the
terms of the argument?' And once I understand those are the
terms of the argument, then maybe I can try to develop a strategy for
moving the parties.  OK.  I mean, that's the way I've
tried to approach the race issue.
<p>
Now what I didn't talk about, but could have and maybe it would have
been more helpful to this group is:  What are the impediments to that
kind of strategy?  In race, one of the impediments is that we have our
arguments about race very often in a context in which what's at stake
is not simply the resolution of a particular dispute, but what's at
stake is power in a broader sense, right?  What's at stake is power of
a political sort, like are you playing the race card in an
election campaign; a power of an economic sort--who's going to get
access to this set of jobs, etc.; power in the sense of,
perhaps, sustaining or attacking a caste structure within a
community.
<p>
So there's a bunch of incentives that the actors have that
fight--that militate against the transformative exercise
that I described.  And I haven't said anything that would address how
you--what you do about this environment of incentives that may
complicate our ability to work things out in the context of race.
That's it.  Derek. <p>

DEREK BOK:  Now, Chris, I just wondered if we could pursue, one step
further, the question of what is wrong with the debate?  What disturbs
us most about the debate, that one would want to direct the
President or other leaders' attention to?  Let me just throw out one
possibility--and I may be wrong on this, because I think this is
very different from abortion, where the views have been relatively
constant.  I think there's one sense in which we could be quite
optimistic and positive about the debate over race, and that is
on the basic issues of value.  This is one of the few
sets of issues in American life in which attitudes have been
changing fairly steadily and fairly positively.
<p>
Up to [the] early '50s people felt if there's a white and a black
and a promotion opening and the black was better than the white, of
course you gave the job to the white.  I mean, nobody would say that
today, and that goes through a whole series of others, and you're very
well familiar with it.  So I think there we've been making progress.
It might be hard to know why we're making progress, and the
progress has continued through the '80s, despite whatever may be
happening on the policy.  I think the views of the American people, by
and large, got somewhat better.
<p>
Now it seems to me the big problem is--and I want to get Amy to
correct me here--is that people are pretty confused about some basic
facts.  So there are really large segments of the American public who
think--not only are wrong on things like simply how many blacks are
there in this society, where they think there are more than twice as
many as there actually are--which is a pretty gross mistake to make
about the public, because that's not like saying, `Who's the senator
from Wyoming?' I mean, you ought to have some sense of what your own
society is made up of, but also on questions like are blacks
better off than whites or are they as well off, economically?  I think
the answers on questions like that are palpably wrong for a great
number of Americans.
<p>
So I guess my hypothesis is that we ought to try to--number
one, we ought to try to figure out what is really wrong with the
debate, because if we don't diagnose what is wrong, we're not going
to be able to say very much about what leadership should consist of.
And my hypothesis is that the fundamental problem is much
more a misconception about basic facts than it is about the ultimate
values, the worth of blacks and whites, the question of, you know,
`Well, how do you feel about blacks moving next door?' I mean, lots of
issues that are sort of personal values.  I don't mean we're all the
way there, but at least the trajectory has been pretty good.  But
there are some very basic misconceptions about what the situation is
that we confront. <p>

And if you don't think that there is as much difference and
disadvantage as there actually is, obviously your views about
affirmative action on a lot of other questions are going to reflect
that.  You're going to think that's grossly unfair.  They don't need
it.  It seems to me more that than it is, `They don't deserve it
because I don't care about their condition.' I don't...
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.  Well...
<p>
BOK:  ... detect that as a central problem.
<p>
EDLEY:  Well, let me give three quick
responses, Derek.  One is you're obviously right about the trend
data, with respect to the attitudes and that the Gallup
report yesterday has more of that information and the lines
are moving in the right direction.  The important point, of course, to
note--everybody here, I'm sure, appreciates this subtlety--is these are
reported attitudes.  These are reported attitudes, not necessarily
what people truly believe or how people act, but simply their reported
attitudes.  What kind of neighborhood...
<p>
BOK:  I think the people...
<p>
EDLEY:  ...would you--what kind of neigh...
<p>
BOK:  Even the people report something that feel they need to
report a different thing.
<p>
EDLEY:  That's the point I was going to make.
<p>
BOK:  That's a change.
<p>
EDLEY:  That's right.  So what kind of 
neighborhood would you like to live in, you know, all
black, all white, somewhat integrated, etc.?  Overwhelming majorities
basically say somewhat integrated--they'd like to live in a somewhat
integrated neighborhood.  Black and white report that.  What will they
actually do, what they actually believe could be different.  So the
best thing that this shows--these things show, reliably, is the force
of the taboo, the strength of the norm--at least in an aspirational
sense of the norm.  And I agree that that definitely is
progress, some we can work with--some we can work with.
<p>
Second, I also believe that you are right with respect to the amount
of misinformation and misunderstanding.  Another anecdote:  There was
a point during this mess with the President--excuse
me--this glorious experience with the President, that we were
preparing him for a press conference, and--so people sitting around
the table in the Cabinet room throwing out questions.  `Mr.
President, what's your position on, you know, the space shuttle?' `Mr.
President, what's your position on what's happening in Tajikistan?'
`Mr.  President, what's your position on affirmative action?'
Whereupon, the President launches into an answer, and the answer was
a long recitation of statistics about the extent of discrimination.
And he talked about tester studies and he talked about the
econometric studies and so on.  And he had all this stuff down.  It
was amazing. <p>

And because discrimination remains such a fact of life in American
society, we need affirmative action, both to combat and to prevent
discrimination.  Everybody says, `Great.  Great.  Great.' And I said,
`Well, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I mean, you're right.
Everything you said is right.  You read all the paper we gave you.
You did your homework.  You get an A.  That's terrific, but the
problem is that your audience isn't going to believe it.  Your
audience doesn't believe it.  They don't think they
discriminate.  They don't think their neighbors discriminate.  They
just don't believe it.  They are going to say, "Well, there goes old
liberal Bill Clinton.  He sees a racist behind every tree."'
<p>
And the President, `OK.  So what do you want me to say?' I said,
`I don't know.  I have no idea what you should say.' I said, `Well,
maybe--look, how about this:  People may not think that they
discriminate right now.  I'm in favor of your teaching the public that
there is discrimination--relentless teaching--but you can't do it just
in a Q-and-A at a press conference.  It requires really a strategy, a
communication strategy.  It requires a relentless
strategy.  What you can say this afternoon, it seems to me, is that
people may not think that they discriminate, but
they're likely to acknowledge that many of us have a simple tendency
to prefer people who are like ourselves--who you go to dinner with on
Sunday night; who you--you know, who you date;  you prefer
people who are like yourself.  Now if you prefer people who are
somewhat--you're looking for some affinity, and often you're looking
for some affinity when you're deciding who to hire or who to promote or
who to do business with.'<p>

Now if you take that simple human tendency and you aggregate that, and
color interferes with our ability to form an affinity and see someone
as like us, then the result will be a systematic denial of
opportunity.  It doesn't matter, in some sense, really whether you
call it discrimination or not.  The point is it results in this denial
of opportunity and that's not the kind of America we want, and we need
affirmative action to tend against that simple human tendency.
<p>
The point I'm trying to make is this:  I agree with you that there are
sharp disagreements about the facts.  I think that persuading people
to change their view of the facts is extremely difficult.  People are
resistant.  You know, think about Bay's theorem, those of you who are
statisticians.  It's very difficult to get somebody to leave their
commitments to empirical propositions.
<p>
Finally, I'd say, I think you may just have a real disagreement
on the values issue.  I think the value disagreements are very,
very important and, indeed, they're important simply
because even if I could get you to agree with me on the facts, we
would then have a big argument about what significance to attach to
the facts.  Even if we've got each other to
agree about the extent of discrimination, we would then just move from
there to a big argument about what kinds of remedies are appropriate
and whether or not we should care that the opportunities of
white small businesses are diminished by 3 percent in the aggregate in
order to make room for minority firms.  But perhaps it's a
researchable issue, to what extent is values driven, to what extent
is--Amy, I'm sorry. <p>

Amy Gutmann and Anthony Appiah have written the most amazing book
called "Color Conscious." If you haven't read it, you should please
read it.  You could read it right after you read mine--no, you don't
have to read mine, just buy mine.  But you should absolutely
read [it], it's a wonderful book. <p>

AMY GUTMANN:  I'll live down that comment.  It seemed to me at
the beginning of your talk you gave an answer to what's wrong with the
public discussion that at least I think is the right answer--onto the
right thing.  And so let me just repeat it in different words and see
if maybe that brings some of these other comments together.
<p>
As I understood it, what we're missing is a sense of collective
striving as citizens for a society with liberty and justice for all.
That is, there's a sense in the debate about race that
it's been divided in a way that's not just a division of people into
Republicans and Democrats or left and right, but a division that a lot
of people feel into black and white, or black, Latino, white.  And why
is that?  Now one reason that I think you gave in your advice to the
President at the beginning of your talk is that it's not enough to
have civility and it's not enough to come out with a program because
we're not going to agree on a program.  What we need is a more
constructive public discussion that's not just a discussion but a
deliberation that has actually some end point with decisions and
programs coming out of it that help move us in that direction.
<p>
So your advice to the President is don't just give us lots of
words, although we need lots of good words, but we also need words
that show a way in which we can get to a society with liberty and
justice for all, closer to it than we are today.  And so let
me just give you just an example of where that's been missing at
the presidential level.  I was invited once, you've been many times,
but once in the last year to a dinner at the White House.  It was
actually in the blizzard of '96 before Clinton's State of the Union
address.  And there were nine academics, three of whom spent their
five minutes that they had to give their initial opening comments to
the President of what he should do it--what the state of American
democracy; three of whom concentrated their five minutes on the issue
of race.  And the six others talked about education and Social
Security and welfare and Bosnia and a whole set of issues.
<p>
In that State of the Union address that followed, President Clinton
spoke about everything that we had talked about that night except
race.  It never came up in that State of the Union address.  And in the
debate--
the last presidential debate, it was Vice
President Gore who dared talk about affirmative action, not President
Clinton.  Now it seems to me that even though there's an intellectual
debate about race, there's been a paucity of leadership on this
issue of the sort that could be called deliberative; that is, that
there's discussion coming to some decision about how we're going to
move ahead concretely as a country.  And so I guess I want to
stop there.  I'm just asking you, that's my
view about what's been missing.  It's not just civility or
civic discourse, but without that at a leadership level,
we're going to be lost or not move ahead.  But it's also
decisions that have real policy implications that are policies.
And we have to put the two together and
they're both necessary, neither sufficient to...
<p>
EDLEY:  OK.  Two points.  Obviously, it does
take sustained leadership of the sort.  And we could have
a very extended discussion about agenda setting and priority setting
and all the rest of it and what that reveals about values
and also what it might reveal about his own perceptions of what is
possible for him to do and when.  And we could all speculate
about that. <p>

I mean, in some sense it seems to me the
more interesting thing for me is this struggling over
the question of--I mean, he it comes to you and he says, `OK.  You
know, I believe what Gutmann said.  I'm ready.  I'm ready to lead.
What do I do?' And it's the `what do I do' that I
think poses ...(unintelligible).  Now--so anyway, that would
be that... <p>

DAVID BROMWICH:  Well, he ...
<p>
EDLEY:  And I think it's right.
<p>
BROMWICH:  ...repealed welfare and held on...
<p>
GUTMANN:  Well...
<p>
BROMWICH:  ...to affirmative action.  Could there be some relation...
<p>
EDLEY:  We just...
<p>
BROMWICH:  ...between the two?
<p>
EDLEY:  Well, absolutely
there's a relationship between--which is why I was talking about the
the thing with opportunity and I think it is interesting that in
welfare the slogan was mended, no.  Let's end it as we know it as
opposed to mend it, don't end it.  It could have been the flip.  It
didn't turn out to be that--it didn't turn out to be flip.  I don't
know.  I wasn't in...
<p>
GUTMANN:  Chris...
<p>
EDLEY:  But let me go back to I think to the
substance of Amy's first point.  Yes, deliberation,
and I was suggesting this element of deliberation.  I think
where I would differ a little bit with some of the stuff that you've
written and I know that Cass has written also...
<p>
GUTMANN:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
EDLEY:  ...is that for me the issue is civic
culture in the sense of community.  The challenge is creating
affinity.  The challenge is creating affinity so that one has a sense
of community.  Certainly in this context that I'm talking about, race,
where I'm trying to figure out how do you bridge the perception gap,
how do you bridge the value gap or, to put it more precisely, what
kinds of interventions, what kinds of experiences will change people's
values?  To me, the key to it is changing people's sense of community,
which means affinity.  I view deliberation as means to an end.  I view
civic deliberation as a means to an end, period, paragraph.
<p>
Finally, let me just say that different strokes for different folks.
Let's not be reductionist.  If the question is:  How do you change
somebody's values?  Some people will change that through a process of
civic deliberation; other people will change their values by reading a
good novel--Right?--by seeing a movie, by something that's
purely experiential.  And so I think that since my bottom line is
this issue of community and affinity, deliberation,
--deliberation is one tool that will work for some people, but
there's a range of tools that have to be--I think that are
required.
<p>
MARI FITZDUFF:  Can I talk about a very public initiative that
took into account these needs?  I, by the way, can I just
say your speech was so transferable.  I'm just busily thinking how I
can get you across to Northern Ireland.  The European Union was faced
with how they would actually effect, as it were, reconciliation.  And
we've struggled with the same issues of equity and mutuality.  Equity
we've done through legislation; mutuality into dependence we've not
succeeded in doing.  Very interesting, we've now had the evaluations
through the program, and the one thing that does seem to be working is
concentrating on process and behavior, not actually on the discourse.
I love the idea of a national conversation--I think we need that--but
concentrating on process and behavior through a very interesting
program where they gave roughly $100 million, not that much, to the 26
local councils and said, `You've a couple of a million each'--on
condition that they combined the politicians, trade unions and
business and community together.  On deciding together about the
future for their community and how a fairly small amount of money
would...
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.
<p>
FITZDUFF:  ...be spent--a couple of million--it fulfills all that we know
in psychological terms about getting people to focus together on their
future as being the best way in which you can increase respect.  That
is the one program that is coming through with very significant,
positive results.  There has been--it doesn't matter what they spend
it on.  It can be fishery; it can be community development...
<p>
EDLEY:  Exactly.
<p>
FITZDUFF:  ...it can be women's issues.  The fact is the process is the
one they've got to get right.  And the European community is making
sure they do.  And willy-nilly, whether people spoke or did not speak
about their divisions, there's a very significant effect on both
behavior and attitudes in terms of interaction and, indeed,
in value changes.  And I'd just thought that you're saying,
`What can we do.' And I love your emphasis on policy because, frankly,
that's what we have to come down to.  And I just thought that that
would be an interesting initiative that might be...
<p>
EDLEY:  That's absolutely terrific because I mean,
I think one of--certainly one of my lines at the beginning--from
the beginning of this has been, `Yeah, we've got to talk with each
other.  We've got to wrestle with the tough
issues, but it can't just be holding hands together around the
campfire singing "Kum Ba Ya."' The question is:  What's supposed to go
on in this deliberation?  What's supposed to happen that will bring to it
this
transforming character because community creating and talking
are not mutually exclusive, right?  There are ways that you can build
a community.  You can create an affinity by coming together and
engaging in a deliberative way.  I suspect that it's most likely
to happen if you're working on something, if you're problem solving.
<p>
FITZDUFF:  Yeah, it does, mm-hmm.
<p>
EDLEY:  ...if you're--if something...
<p>
MICHAEL PIORE:  But does all this mean...
<p>
EDLEY:  I feel like I shouldn't be calling on people because I
don't know... <p>

JUDITH RODIN:  Paul said you would call on people.  I'm happy to
do that.  He thought you were... <p>

EDLEY:  OK.  But maybe you should call on people because I
don't--you want a structured discussion.  I don't know...
<p>
RODIN:  No, I think we've very structured.
<p>
PIORE:  It seems to me there's a basic contradiction,
though, here between community and
deliberation.  And it's not clear to me--I mean, what you've
made a...
<p>
EDLEY:  Is that Michael?
<p>
PIORE:  Yeah.
<p>
EDLEY:  Oh, hi.
<p>
PIORE:  I mean, you made such an...
<p>
EDLEY:  You--you...
<p>
PIORE:  ...elegant presentation and one that's so
attractive that, I really hesitate to break
into it.  But on the one hand you talk about
presidential leadership and the President kind of orchestrating the
conversation.  But on the other hand, buried in your talk is this
notion that you don't want to have to talk about race at a
cocktail party or in the office and, I mean, it's there, it
seems to me, that the break in the community comes through,
because, I mean, it's so painful to have these conversations in
day-to-day life.  Who wants to be on the line in day-to-day life all
the time on race?  So you don't talk about it.  And it's at
that point that the community breaks down.  And I guess 
it makes me wonder whether community really is a feasible
approach to this issue, whether we should and whether we
shouldn't be talking about negotiation, about a whole range
of ways with dealing with an interracial society, but the notion
that you could--given how painful it has become--that you could
actually break down the barriers between these
two communities, have the kind of conversion.
<p>
EDLEY:  Well, th...
<p>
PIORE:  I mean, don't you need to have face-to-face conversation
to have a conversion?  Can the President really produce
the conversion?
<p>
EDLEY:  Look, I agree with absolutely
everything that you said.  Here are two quick
possibilities.  One is--first of all, I try as a discipline not to say
community building or community creating kind of stuff to me the
right metaphor is community connecting.  That is to say I don't--I
mean, we could go--have a long discussion about that identity politics
and nationalism vs. universalism and all that stuff.  I think that's
Chapter 10 in the book.
<p>
But in a way, I mean, let's just assume that there
will continue to be some separation in these communities, the question
is effective commerce between them, exchange between them, a
bridge, if you will, a connection between them that a more
modest ambition of that sort.  Again, I don't necessarily--it's not
assimilation and it's not convergence necessarily.  So I agree
with you that negotiation--that's another way.  If you're--still,
having said that--second paragraph--it's hard even if it's just
negotiation rather than conversion.  It's hard.  And my sense is
that--look, I had a conversation with the superintendent of schools
in Boston.  I said, `How are you going'--we were talking about his
agenda.  I said, `How in the world are you going to pull this off when
you've got the black, Latino, Asian, white polarization that exists in the
city, on the city council, in the school committee?  What is your strategy
for dealing with all this polarization?'  And he said, 'I don't have one.
I can't figure it out.  Not only can I not
figure it out, I can't find any political allies to help me with it.
It's too hard.  And so one of my ambitions--if you ask, What
can the President do?  The President can't go into coffee things all
around--but he can probably possibly--I don't know--maybe I'm on
medication here--he can model for us some of what it takes.  He can
model for us some of what it takes.'
<p>
What I want is, I want a document that will be a resource for people
like that superintendent, who are looking for suggestions, who are
looking for help about how, in their community, in their organization,
in their institution, they can lead effectively on these issues.  The
President can't come to that coffee club--coffee klatch.  He can't
come to every school district.  But perhaps he can produce something
that will be helpful to people who want to lead on this issue, who
right now avoid it because it's so damned hard.
<p>
Lani.
<p>
LANI GUINIER:  I really enjoyed listening to you, Chris, and I have some
of
the same skepticism that I think you're hearing in the room, and I
don't think it's appropriately directed toward you.  I think that the
skepticism is really something that we have to address.  You're doing
your job, which is important, and I think what you said--and it also
echoes some of what Jay Rosen said earlier this morning.  He said,
`What would a reconstructed public dialogue look like?  What sort of
imaginative possibilities would be in it?  Who would be in it?' And I
think that those are the challenges for this Commission, and I don't
think Bill Clinton will be in that reconstructed public dialogue that
we're talking about, although he can make space for it.
<p>
EDLEY:  Exactly.
<p>
GUINIER:  And so whatever he does to make space for a reconstructed
public dialogue, in my view, would be extraordinarily constructive.
The reason I don't think he can do it is because he's a politician and
for all of the other reasons that you identified.  He is busy.  He has
other competing needs.  And, most important, he has to deal with the
national press corps, and they are going to sabotage any good-faith
effort that he makes.  That's one problem.  I think he also has, in my
view--obviously, this is not surprising--a credibility gap on this
issue, and that's something he has to address.
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.
<p>
GUINIER:  I mean, he believes in redemption.  I think he needs to come
out and redeem himself and not just say, you know, `I have an
enlightened view of race and have followed it,' but, `I have--I wish I
could have been a better person on a number of issues.' And I
think that would go a long way, in terms of giving people in this
country a sense that he understands how complicated the problem is.
But that's for you and Paul Begala and the President to work on.
<p>
What is more interesting to me is, really, how do we, as a commission,
try and address Jay Rosen's question and talk about some of the other
challenges?  And I think you also had a taste of
that when you said, `How do we give the American people a conversion
experience about this issue?' And nothing that Bill Clinton says or
does is going to give them a conversion experience.  He can make the
space so that--and I think Mari's point--if he were to say, `And I'm
going to give $100 million to 26 regional councils to have local
conversations over a period of time to figure out how they're going to
address this meeting, to function as public citizen juries on issues
that have a racial overtone.  I'm going to have facilitators helping
them to deliberate--because I don't think, certainly, the research
that we've done at Penn with Penn undergraduates shows it's not enough
to bring people together.
<p>
EDLEY:  Yes. <p>

GUINIER:  It's not enough to have them in affinity groups.  It's not
enough to talk.  They also need skills to try to expose the way
that they've been processing information.  They need help.
And it's part of the reason they can't process the evidence that
you're providing is that because of their, quote--and the
psychologists can certainly say this better than I--but because of
their racial schemata, because of the way in which they have
processed--the shortcuts--the information shortcuts they've taken to
process race, they have a very selective memory about the facts that
you provide them.  They also understand and interpret those facts,
consistent with their information processing framework.
<p>
So you've got to uncover all of that.  You can't do it on a national
level, but you can do it at a local level.  And I think if we got
people to see that this is possible, it can be fun--it's not just
having a fight at a cocktail party, but it can actually be a
deliberative and conversion experience that not only makes you a
better person, but enables you to work with other people from very
different backgrounds to solve real problems.  That's empowering.
<p>
If you give people the sense, `Hey, I'm not just feeling better about
myself, but boy, when we come together and we talk with these
other people,' because we need their information processing schemata
to check our own and because when we all put our different
perspectives on the table, we begin to see, as you said, the
complexity and the richness of the problem, well, then we can
start solving it, because now we're beginning to understand this
problem.  And if we invite them to brainstorm creatively and
innovatively about the problem--they're not stuck thinking inside the
box.  They don't have to come up with the same public policy solution
in Austin, Texas, that they come up with in Boston, Massachusetts,
because it's... <p>

EDLEY:  It doesn't have to be the same problem, even...
<p>
GUINIER:  Right.
<p>
EDLEY:  ...that they're working on.  It can be...
<p>
GUINIER:  Exactly.  So I think it's really important for this commission
to focus on your question, tied to Jay's question:  What kind of
conversations will enable ordinary
Americans to have the conversion experience that gives them
confidence--and this is Amy's point--to believe that we can
collectively strive to make a better neighborhood, a better community,
a better society?  And I think that's a challenge.  I 
think it's a challenge that we're up to.  And I would like
to hear other people--not just you, but I'd like to hear other people
talk about what kinds of conversion experiences have they
participated in?  What kinds of conversations have they had?  What
kinds of deliberations have they been part of?  We heard some of this
at the first meeting.  I still quote James Fishkin's deliberative poll
with the guy from Arizona talking to the welfare mother from New
York.  I mean, I think putting that on the table gives us a sense of
possibility and gives us the feeling that we can start striving to
something better.
<p>
EDLEY:  Absolutely.  And I agree with everything that Lani
said and that that list of five things that I said it
seems to me it's critical for the President to do, that fourth was
identifying the promising paths towards the vision.  I mean,
that's what I'm talking about.  I'm saying it's
examples like the one you talked about in
Northern [Ireland]--because the point is that
those all over the country who would like to make progress
on this issue do need help figuring out, `Well, what is it that I
could do that might make a difference?  You know, what is that set of
skills?  What are the approaches that would do it?'
And part of making space--that Lani was talking about--part of
making space, it seems to me, is feeding those leaders, is giving
them the ideas, is presenting some models that might be
useful.  That's--I mean, from my
own--that's why I was--that's why, for me, the most important part of
this was to get him to write a book, is that... <p>

PAUL VERKUIL:  Chris, can I just follow up on that?  In the sense of
whether the dialogue or the conversation is honest among politicians, like
Lani said, I think we've got this phrase, as you use it, `playing the race
card,' is a big--it's in the way, because it means that it's hard to have
a conversation that's honest because every time race is raised, people are
very suspicious about motives, and it's either, you know, seen as I think
playing the race card is largely played by one kind of politician.  It's
usually a conservative white politician and not seen as--you know, maybe a
liberal black politician.  But nonetheless, it's that kind of a phrase
which has pushed some of the real honest dialogue in the background.  And
I don't know if politicians even--including the President, are really
qualified to reintroduce it.  It needs a more broad based community.  And
I would add, you know, the corporate leadership, union leadership and
community leadership, where they're not tainted by the motivation to get
it going.  <p> One thing that struck me--I was in Virginia when Doug
Wilder won the governor's race, and he was ahead 15 points the day before
the race and he won, as you may know, by about 1/10th of 1 point.  He won
by a handful of votes.  And everyone concluded that there is this race
effect, that people are not willing to be honest.  And they will say who
they're going to vote for, but when it comes time to pulling the lever,
they won't do it.  This, I think, Derek, occurs to me maybe--I think,
maybe this is purely speculative, but it may have something to do with why
people are moving in favor of interracial things when it comes time to ask
them, because it costs them nothing, but they also think, for example,
that minorities are much larger in the population and we're much better
off.  Maybe those are the real answers of how they feel about the other
question, and they say it in a kind of passive-aggressive way.  They think
that, you know, all that's going on here is that minorities are doing more
and they don't really want to know the truth.  And so to get the truth out
is a very complicated process, because we have to trust the people who are
having the conversation.  <p> EDLEY:  I just want to say, I disagree with
you on the race card point, and here's why.  I think that there are
helpful ways and unhelpful ways to talk about race.  Helpful way--there's
a right way; there's a wrong...  <p> VERKUIL:  Right.  <p> EDLEY:  ...and
the difficulty is not so much that race gets injected into--but the way in
which it gets injected.  And one of the things that I think needs to
happen in a conversation about race, be it national or local or community
or whatever, is that people need to have some sense, I think, of what is a
helpful way to talk about this issue and what is a destructive way to help
in this issue.  I mentioned the issue of platitudes as being an example
of, it seems to me, what's not a helpful way of doing it, things that--you
know, that we're all familiar with the arguments about stereotypes and all
the rest of--there are affirmatively destructive ways in which some
political leaders--too many political leaders talk about the issue.  And
one of the things we need to do, if you will, is out those examples of bad
leadership and fight against them.  Sir.  <p> ROBERT WIEBE:  Whoops.  I do
want to pick up on what Paul said.  I think that--I'm sorry.  <p> EDLEY: 
No, no, no.  That's all right.  <p> WIEBE:  I just wanted to pick up on
what Paul said.  I think that he brings us back to the beginning of your
talk where I, at least, listening to you, thought you were structuring the
world in which you needed to communicate the complexity and, indeed, the
kind of inflammability that affirmative action raises in the political
circles that Clinton presides over.  You think it's simple.  You bring up
code words.  But code words will mean many things to many people.  They
will elicit responses you aren't aware of.  You then moved on and talked
to us about, what I put down in my notes, 'differing visions of the good
society.' Different people have visions of the good society.  They may be
utilitarian.  They may be utopian.  They may be all kinds of things.  But
race will have a very different meaning in many of these.  And much of our
discussion has been how, over the long run, might there be ways of
allowing people with these different visions to understand one another
better.  How can you build these bridges across different visions, to mix
the metaphor?  <p> But to go back to the concrete political issues of
today, it seems to me that if we presume that each of these code words
will elicit volatile, sharply different, often hostile--I think, the
prescription for public policy becomes almost the antithesis of the
prescription for the long-term change; that is, long-term change requires
that we bring out things that are difficult; we reckon with issues that
are wrenching; we have to move our minds in ways that will be difficult
and perhaps long term.  The short-term policy issue is:  Vote now.  And
voting now on a particular issue, it seems to me, almost by the logic of
your talk, means you need to mask or to mute or to make as least
significant as possible those code words that will be most likely to
expose the explosive feelings that do now exist and that we're trying to
transform.  So it's almost as if we have two worlds you have asked us to
enter...  <p> EDLEY:  That's fair.  <p> WIEBE:  ...the world of today and
the world of an indeterminate future that we hope will come.  <p> EDLEY: 
That's fair.  Let me just fence out, if I may, the particularly difficult
context of sort of an electoral immediacy and talk more generally about
what might happen in civic discourse.  <p> Here's my experience of this. 
My experience with this is two things.  It's--first of all, when you ask a
politician, `What do you believe in?' they say, `I'm for equal
opportunity, I'm against discrimination and I'm against quotas.' Point
number one, bullshit.  I mean, that's, you know, very nice, but what
mainstream politician couldn't say those words, all right?  David Duke
believes that; not helpful.  Right.  Not helpful.  Second context:  I'm
for merit; you're for equal results--proportional representation.  Now my
problem is that there are ways to use code words, that many of our code
words not only mask the underlying empirical and value commitments but
they lock us into a debate that has an oppositional character to it, it
seems to me, that is inflammatory.  <p> BROMWICH:  Do you mean to say... 
<p> EDLEY:  What I want to talk about is...  <p> BROMWICH:  Are you saying
that merit is a racist code word?  It's me...  <p> EDLEY:  Just--oh--oh,
hi.  <p> BROMWICH:  ...David Bromwich.  Are you saying that merit is a
racist code word.  <p> EDLEY:  Well, it depends on how it's being used. 
What I'm saying is that...  <p> BROMWICH:  Because I would like, at this
moment to testify to a conversion experience of my own, which is that
people who do a job well are valuable for doing the job well.  And from
that point of view, one of the most racially destructive things done in
the country in recent years was Bill Clinton saying he wanted a Cabinet
that looked like America.  Ron Brown should have been denied the job of
Secretary of Commerce, not because he was black or white but because he
was too corrupt and too much in the pocket of foreign investors and too
unsympathetic to American labor.  It is the existence of the idea of merit
that makes it possible for me to speak thus idealistically.  If you do
away with that, you've done away with one of the few secular conversionary
ideals that people hold.  Good luck with your religious ideals, since you
don't seem to be very religious.  But there's going to be an enormous
trouble starting the community conversations if you give up merit with the
notion that it is a racist code word.  <p> EDLEY:  I did not say
that--now, look...  <p> BROMWICH:  You were on the verge of saying it. 
<p> EDLEY:  ...I know what I was on the verge of saying.  Here's my
position--OK?--which is in Chapter 7.  My position is is that the
discussion we ought to have, in whatever the context, whether it's the
Cabinet or whether it's admissions to the University of Pennsylvania, is,
I mean, what do we mean by merit?  And to make space for different
conceptions of merit and have a discussion about which conception of merit
is preferable.  And the point I'm arguing is that the kind of leadership
we want in the discourse, it seems to me, is not leadership that will
speak in shorthand using code words, like `equal opportunity' or `merit,'
but rather leadership that will help a community see to it that there's
some important choices, important issues, at stake, and now let's discuss
those.  I think that that is more productive, ultimately, of the kinds of
connections that we're talking about.  Claude has been trying to...  <p>
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:  Could--could--I'm sorry.  <p> EDLEY:  I'm--I'm sorry. 
<p> CLAUDE STEELE:  Well, it's a little less relevant now, but in
directing the President, one thing that was occurring to me is that so
much of the time, I think the discussion is more constructively held at
the level of particulars.  What's very difficult to achieve or resolve at
a very abstract level and inevitably produces polarization and...  

<p>
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:  Mm-hmm.  

<p> STEELE:  ...conflict can sometimes be resolved
miraculously at the level of particulars and whereas the unit of thinking
about this is often the entire society.  And we talk about cocktail
parties and we talk about discussions which are at that level.  If you're
talking about how to get more minority graduate students, for example, and
how to train them and how to get a culture that works for--with them, you
can be much more effective about it, and I think this is...  <p> EDLEY: 
Yes, I see.  
<p> STEELE:  ...there's a messenger back to the President.  I
think this is a very useful tack to take in this kind of discourse.  <p>

EDLEY:  Edna?  Edna just had her...  

<p> EDNA ULLMANN-MARGALIT:  OK.  <p>

EDLEY:  Hi, there.  I have a list here now.  Great.  

<p> MARGALIT:  Thank
you.  Let me just say to you that I am one of the very few foreigners in
this group, and--I mean, non-Americans.  And as I was listening to you, I
was really experiencing a kind of two-tier listening.  One level was
trying to learn from you as much as I could about the race problem in
America, and I admit that I have learned a lot, and I really am grateful
to your presentation and I join the other people here who have appreciated
your presentation.  I think that I've learned a lot about how to frame
that discussion in this country and how to think about that.  So this
helped me there.  The other level, which was simultaneous with this, was
whether at all--and this goes back to Mari's point about Northern
Ireland--whether it can be translated into problems which are extremely
divisive in my own country, which is Israel, and I think of at least two
such extremely divisive issues.  And there I'm stuck.  I'm not quite sure
to what an extent this is helpful. <p>

And I want to go back to a point that I think Derek Bok made and
also Michael Sandel.  I think, basically, as difficult and
complicated and painful and emotional and historically loaded
the problem of race in this country is, basically, I agree with
Derek Bok, that the basic value is not contested.  It's
perceptions and it's empirical--it's facts and it's perceptions and
all sorts of things get into this.  But basically, people are against
discrimination; let's put it this way.  Or, at least on the level that
you call unhelpful, I think it is helpful.  Even if it is, you
know, a cliche and a platitude, the fact that people will say that
they are against discrimination...
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.
<p>
MARGALIT:  ...it's not irrelevant and it's not trivial.  It is...
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.  An inequality norm.  Yeah.  That's right.
<p>
MARGALIT:  Right.  Now--but there are issues where the division is there
and it is a basic division and it is a division about values.  And
when you say, `Let's get clear of the unclarity,' and once we clarify
the underlying issues, we are safe.  We are sound.  We are doing well.
I think that there are problems, and Michael Sandel mentioned
abortion in this country.  There are problems where when
you--where you clear all the unclarities and you get to the
bottom-line issues--this is where the problem is...
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.
<p>
MARGALIT:  ...and you are optimistic and I think rightly optimistic about
race, because I think there can be progress.  There has been progress.
There are divisions about all sorts of things and about whether, you
know, how we would deal with affirmative action and to
what--when you laid out the spectrum, where do we want to find
ourselves?  Lots of problems like that.  But the underlying issue is
not the divisive issue, I think.  And my question to you is:  What
would your speculation, view, you know, comment be on how to deal with
issues which are at the bottom level, are extremely divisive?  When
you clear all the unclarities, you are down there with two
opposing positions where there is no reconciliation between them, and
it's not a posturing or a framing of the debate that makes it a polar
issue; it is a polar issue. <p>

Let me just say, in my case, I'm thinking of two things.  One
of them is what to do with territories, hold on to them or compromise
on them--OK?--territories gave them...
<p>
EDLEY:  Who is a Jew?
<p>
MARGALIT:  ...th--30 years ago...
<p>
EDLEY:  Yeah.
<p>
MARGALIT:  ...and the other is the sort of religious w...
<p>
EDLEY:  Who is...
<p>
MARGALIT:  ...the nature of public space, you know, in terms of
religion.
<p>
EDLEY:  I see.
<p>
MARGALIT:  And when you say, `Conversion experiences might be helpful,'
I am very weary of that because, you know, I'm
familiar with conversion experiences which are...
<p>
ABNER MIKVA:  Suppose you come to a mikvah...
<p>
MARGALIT:  ...and which can be manipulative and which can be extremely
dangerous, and when I hear this expression,
I shrink.  And you just have this recent book published here in this
country about the codes in the Bible and you have no idea what
effect it has on people's lives and it is a kind of conversion
experience on people's lives.  And it's extremely
dangerous, and that's not the way to solve that particular problem.
<p>
EDLEY:  I see.
<p>
MARGALIT:  So when the divisive issue is such that this is what
Michael Sandel described before, when people--you
described the abortion clinics and the way this gets played out in
front of the clinic.  And in my country, it gets played out in
various ways.  But the problem is that the other side is entirely
delegitimized in the eyes of--there are two sides, and each side
delegitimizes the other.  And the question of how to--I mean,
it's not a question of community.  They all belong to
the same community.  It's not a question of community building or
community connecting.  It's a question of how to go on, when
there is this extremely divisive basic issue where it's clear that
there are two positions.  No conversion experience is going to bring
people to the light because there are two lights.
<p>
EDLEY:  I'm with you.
<p>
MARGALIT:  And what would your views on this be?
<p>
EDLEY:  Well, I think my--the right answer is probably
the framework that I have wouldn't work.  That's probably the right
answer.  But let me try this.  I think what I'm
suggesting has two pieces to it.  The first piece of it is you improve
the discussion by finding the deep sources of disagreement and trying
to engage people about those.  I mean, let's not argue:  You're in
favor of merit; I'm in favor of proportional representation.  Let's
argue about what the mission of the institution ought to be, what the
mission of the university ought to be, point number one. <p>

And point number two, my assumption is that there will be situations
in which we can get people to come together on their differences and
values and their differences in values, not in the
sense of--not simply in the sense of personal values but in the sense
of civic values.  We can get people to change their views by changing
their sense of who is in their community or what communities do they
feel connected with.  So the conversion experiences I'm looking for,
obviously, are ones in which people reinvent their sense of with whom
are they connected.
<p>
Now the problem is that I'm perfectly prepared to admit that there
are certain circumstances in which there
are communities that simply have chosen to be at war with each other.
And it's... <p>

MARGALIT:  The pro-life and pro-choice in this country--is this a good
example or it's... <p>

EDLEY:  I think it's--to me it's a...
<p>
MARGALIT:  How would you?
<p>
EDLEY:  To me, it's an example where I really doubt that
the communities can come together.  The hypothesis
in the terms that I'm talking--my hypothesis would be that
notwithstanding their polarized disagreement, there may be a way to
change the nature of the discourse so that it is less inflammatory and
there can sort of be an agreement to disagree, or there can at least
be a 'cold war' rather than a `Hot War' so that the struggle
continues, but it continues using different weapons
in different venues.  That would be the kind of shift that I would
take.
<p>
But I want to go back to my first point, which is, I'm
not confident at all that what I've thought through in the context of
race can be easily exported to others.
<p>
Jay Rosen is the person...
<p>
JAY ROSEN:  I want to go back to the question that Michael Sandel
asked you, the first question, and maybe address some of the
points that Lani was making, because I had a different experience
than Michael did, although I listened to the same talk.  I heard you
articulate a very nuanced, complex view of the choices and
consequences and difficulty of affirmative action, of race issues, for
us.  And the problem of the current climate of public discourse was
represented in your story, essentially, by Stephanopoulos in the room.
You know, Stephanopoulos says, `OK.  That's great.  But how am I going
to explain that?' Right?  And in saying that, Stephanopoulos is
representing the current climate of warfare and public discourse; he's
representing the Capitol press corps, which he knows is going to ask
certain kinds of questions about that position; he's thinking ahead to
the 30-second ads--Right?--in the next campaign and what people could
do with that, so he's representing the political consultants when he
says that, right?
<p>
And so in that sense, Stephanopoulos and the concerns
represented by his remark, which are everybody's concerns, I
would assume, in that environment, are cutting against the very
clear and very compelling and elegant discussion and sort of
architecture of the public issue that you're providing us here.
<p>
So this is very good, because it places us in an imaginative space
where we have a problem that's relevant to this Commission, which is:
If an argument about affirmative action or race needs to be conducted
in the way that you suggested to us, but Stephanopoulos is also
right--or he's representing real world concerns--then what would
leadership look like in civic discourse, right?
<p>
EDLEY:  Gre...
<p>
ROSEN:  Now OK.  Now...
<p>
EDLEY:  OK.  All right.
<p>
ROSEN:  So that's a problem, you see, that we
can deal with as a commission.
<p>
Now I have some ideas about that.  These are not ideas for
Clinton; they're ideas for us to think
about--OK?--because--I've thought about this a little bit, and
especially the problem with the press, because one of the things that
I assume people are saying in that room is, `Look, if we say that,
we're going to get killed, you know, tomorrow in the press room,
because they're going to ask us, "Are you coming out for quotas?"' or
whatever--all this stuff, and they're just going to recycle the
current terms of the debate, right?
<p>
I liked your five-point program, by the way.  So
here's my five-part program.  But, again, this is for the Commission,
not for the President.  Suppose the President comes out and he says,
`Here's my
public position,' let's say on affirmative action, and it's something
like what you suggested--you know, `Affirmative action's important to
remedy and prevent discrimination and increase diversity,' right?
Then he also, on the same day, at the same event, comes out with the
President's public exposition, OK?
And this is a lengthy document that does what you just did for us and
lays out the reasoning behind the President's position; lays out his
thinking in some detail; lays out the architecture of the issue in
terms of values, choices, priorities; and most importantly, leaves
room for further debate and argument, right?
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.  Right. <p>

ROSEN:  And that is published too...
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.
<p>
ROSEN:  ...OK?  And think of it as being on the Web...
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.
<p>
ROSEN:  ...Right?--now.  So then you say to
Stephanopoulos, `It's OK, George.  When the press corps
says, "Are you coming out for quotas, Mr.  President?" you simply have
the president's spokesman say, "Did you read the exposition?"'
You see?  `Until you've read the exposition, don't ask me that
question.  It's in the exposition,' you see?  And you encourage people
around the country, like us, and everybody else who's on the
Web--which is a lot of people who are not like us; they're just
people--to read the exposition--Right?--in addition to the position.
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.
<p>
ROSEN:  And you do direct battle--You see?--with the
sound bite culture by coming out with a position and an exposition.
<p>
Now the art of it, obviously, would be...
<p>
EDLEY:  `Don't ask; surf the Web,' right? `Surf the Net, sir.'
<p>
ROSEN:  ...that the position would have to relate to the
exposition and vice versa.
<p>
EDLEY:  Yes.
<p>
ROSEN:  The position would have to relate
to the exposition; the exposition would have to report out the
position. <p>

Now if the President could do those two things and then also say,
`Therefore, here is my present course of action.  More to come.
Here's my suggestions for the nation's course of action,' and all the
things people can do, as you were saying, `More to come.  And,' as
Lani was saying, `here are my personal public reflections on race,'
you see?  All five of those things at once--that would be leadership
in civic discourse.  And you just take on the sound bite
mentality directly--you see?--by giving people a map of a possible
conversation, putting it out there.  And when they come back with the,
you know, truncated terms of public dialogue, you say, `You know,
we've tried to address that,' and just put it out there and see
what happens.  That would be leadership.
<p>
JAMES FISHKIN:  Could we hear what Paul would think of that?
I'm fascinated.  I don't want to lose this moment.  Would
the press pick the exposition apart for potentially embarrassing sound
bites so the sound bite culture would win, or would the press actually
read the exposition and acquire a nuanced-enough account...
<p>
EDLEY:  I think three of them would...
<p>
FISHKIN:  ...of the President's position that would--or how would that
work?  I mean... <p>

PAUL BEGALA:  Hey, Jay, actually, I think it's a very good idea to
begin with, and I'd be surprised if we don't see something like
that out of the race initiative that Chris is working on.
<p>
EDLEY:  That's what I've recommended.
<p>
BEGALA:  I think you will see that.  But the
target audience is less--you know, say Paul Taylor, who's covering us
day to day, because Paul's got to go, and you've got, you know,
special counsel Bromwich is indicting our secretary of commerce that
day and, you know, Mikva's up for the Supreme Court.  And, I mean,
he's got to cover three or four things, and he can't read 500 pages on
race.
<p>
ROSEN:  Right.
<p>
BEGALA:  But maybe Calvin can.  Maybe others who have a little
more space and time--I mean, I've been a great press basher, but it's
not always their fault; there is a larger system and a job that
they've got to do. <p>

ROSEN:  Oh, yeah.
<p>
BEGALA:  But, yes, they'll pick it apart, or if not them,
than, you know, someone at the Manhattan Institute--you know,
whoever's got Betsy McCaughey's old job; I guess she's got it back
now--is going to go through all 1,342 pages of that, like the
health-care plan had, and pick out things that are completely out of
context or, even worse, dissemble about them.
<p>
Still, given all those risks and problems, it's still a very good
idea, and I bet you it's one he winds up doing.
<p>
EDLEY:  And look, I think that's my point
about how the report from the President, the book from the
President, that--you know, that I want to see in 1998, not 2002...
<p>
ROSEN:  Mm.
<p>
EDLEY:  ...the report from the book--from the President that has that
quality to it, and I agree that it has to be open to create space...
<p>
ROSEN:  Open, yeah.
<p>
EDLEY:  ...I think is extremely important.
Having said that, let me just say a word in George's defense.  I
think--the interesting point, I think, is that there's a George
everywhere. <p>

ROSEN:  Sure.
<p>
EDLEY:  And in particular, I view George's role in that kind
of a conversation as the person who's thinking about, `How do you
teach, given the constraints that you, the leader, have in your
context?' Now different leaders...
<p>
RODIN:  Whom do you teach is what George is thinking about, in
addition to how. <p>

EDLEY:  Yes.  That's right.  But,
one of the other things about the President, unlike many other
leaders, is that when he speaks, in a way, he's generally
talking to everybody and he doesn't get--so there's that.  But
I--what I'm saying is that different leaders have a different context
and have different constraints on how they can teach.  The President
subjected to Paul Taylors of the world--right?--can only, you know,
can only squeeze a little bit through the haze.  And, therefore, what
George is saying is, you know, `Nice, complicated analysis, Edley, but
we've got to make it so Paul Taylor can
understand it and his...
<p>
ROSEN:  Yeah.
<p>
EDLEY:  ...and more challenging, Taylor's editor can understand it, right?
<p>
ROSEN:  Right.
<p>
EDLEY:  But the leadership issue and the
constraints of teaching and so forth that the superintendent of Boston
has--they're quite different, or that a minister has or that you have
would be quite different.  So I guess what I'd view it as
this very nuanced sense of what the teaching possibilities are for
leaders being highly variable.
<p>
ROSEN:  Mm.
<p>
EDLEY:  And then I'm instructed to talk to...
<p>
RODIN:  Can...
<p>
EDLEY:  Oh.
<p>
RODIN:  Did you want to comment on this?
<p>
MIKVA:  You know, we have a little bit of different
recollections.  I enjoyed everything you said, Chris, but I remember
that press conference preparation very well.
<p>
EDLEY:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
MIKVA:  But I remember when he finished his answer--I forget who I
was sitting next to, but the consensus on our side of the table was,
if he could only give that answer out there...
<p>
EDLEY:  Yes.
<p>
MIKVA:  ...because that one was the pulpit, and he had full control
of it.  I'm sorry, Lani, but when he uses that as a pulpit, he has
great credibility.  Unfortunately, we primed him and prepped him.
<p>
UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  Maybe not.
<p>
MIKVA:  The "Bell Curve" was a big thing there.  And they didn't ask
him, and he volunteered it and it came out a wash.
Whereas, the affirmative action speech he made
was a plus because he did use the pulpit, not a lot of it came
through.  And a lot of the nuances that you've worked on didn't come
through, but I hope he uses this opportunity out in California just
to use the pulpit.  Maybe it's to create the space; maybe it's to
remind us that our values are now more common than they were 50
years ago. <p>

He doesn't have to educate people about equality.  He isn't
breaking through the segregation of the armed forces or
letting the first black in Ole Miss.  He now just has to use
the pulpit to tell us that things aren't as great as some of
his critics are saying they are and that they don't have to do
anything.  And it's not going to be the nuanced
program that we need to figure out how to get other local leaders to
do the things they have to do.  It's not going to get us to the kind
of thing that Paul Begala was talking about at the lunch
table--maybe getting us to start focusing again on diversity as a plus
rather than just talking about it as equality being fair, to start
reminding people that the rest of us have a stake in this issue.
<p>
But those aren't things the President can do, and not in that one
speech out in California.  And the book, yeah, someday, I'd like
to take a poll of how many people have read the books that presidents
or presidential candidates have written, and I suspect
it'll be very small--nowhere near as many people as can be influenced
by this speech. <p>

EDLEY:  That's all right.  But you'll read it.  You'll read it.
Lawrence Long.
<p>
RODIN:  Go ahead.
<p>
EDLEY:  Lawrence--Lawrence Long?
<p>
RODIN:  Lawrence Lessig, maybe?
<p>
EDLEY:  Lawr--oh, Lawrence Lessig.  Ah, that's--I think--OK.  How are
you? <p>

LAWRENCE LESSIG:  Actually I wanted to go back to
something that I think Lani and Mari were both pointing to,
and your point, which I take is absolutely right, that what's
necessary--I think you used the word `transformation'--`What's
necessary is to bring about a transformation,' opens up an empirical
question on its own.  And one presupposition we've had here is that
transformation is brought about through dialogue, right?  And each of
us have a conception of what dialogue is.  But I guess I want to take
an extreme position and say, `Why dialogue?' I mean, think about the
experiences of transformation that any of us have had or people--you
know, the people that are really out there
to be transformed.  It's not the kind of transformation through this
kind of dialogue, right?  It's a transformation through different
types of experiences.
<p>
So when Mari's pointing to a kind of community theater experience,
which is not overtly teaching in the way that you described the
President overtly teaching, although I think the President can overtly
teach, that transformation comes about through a different structure.
And so, I guess and I think even Lani's really
complicated dialogues that she's constructing in experiments I
think both in your class and also in experiments are
really quite elaborate in attempting to bring about experiences that
change the way people see the world as opposed to arguments, right?
And I think arguments have their place, but what we're talking about
is changing how people see.  And changing how they see is done through
many techniques.
<p>
I guess there's an empirical question, and you
pointed to it, but I wonder how much, you know,
you know, you're trapped in the White House, how much you're
allowed to think about it.  But there's an empirical question about
the extent to which techniques other than, you know, the dialogue
and expression are the techniques that are necessary for
transformation to the extent to which those are possible and
how we bring them about and what they are.  Empirically, are they
more effective than the techniques of dialogue?
<p>
JEAN BETHKE ELSHTAIN:  Could I--and it's right on this point, if I may
just follow up on it...
<p>
EDLEY:  Please, go ahead.
<p>
ELSHTAIN:  ...because I'm skeptical about the conversation metaphor model
a bit, too, and here's why.  I'm thinking of some of the conversations
I've had, reports from community organizers who say things like this.
They say, `The last thing you want to do is to say to folks, "Oh,
well, let's get together and talk about race."' What you want to
do, in fact, is to get people together to work on certain concrete
issues and areas and problems.  `What about the streets?  What about
the schools?  What about the question of jobs?' And you do that in a
biracial, triracial sort of setting.  And when people have the
actual experience of working on concrete issues and problems
together, then, after a while, you can begin to think about, or even
deal with--or if people discover that along the way, certain issues
about race are, in fact, being dealt with because they've learned to
work together with people and to cooperate on certain concrete issues
and problems.
<p>
I'm worried about the conversation metaphor in part because I think
our notion of conversation is terribly corrupted in this society right
now.  It's corrupted by, for example, the media issues
that we've talked about a bit and that I know we'll be talking about
more--sort of talk show phenomenon.  What is a conversation?  What is
honest dialogue?  It's sort of, you know, it's slicing
your chest open and showing your beating heart, you know?
It's spilling everything.  It's getting out all the
deepest, darkest...
<p>
EDLEY:  Right.
<p>
ELSHTAIN:  ...most horrible things about oneself.  And then you
--you know, you poison the atmosphere so deeply that people have
a terribly hard time having a conversation with one another, much
less trusting one another and working together.
<p>
And one of the big concerns at present, as many of you know, is a sort
of plummeting level of social trust--the fact that we don't trust
government; the fact that we don't trust one another very much.  So
I think that the issue, again, of what are the institutional
structures, what are the frameworks, what are the mechanisms that will
bring people together or across certain kinds of lines so that they
can work together concretely, and then, from that, begin to build
toward greater racial trust and amity and so on.  And I think that's
the real...
<p>
EDLEY:  Yeah.  Right.  I want to resist
sort of corner solutions reductionism here.  It seems
to me that on a spectrum from just talking to
experience--whoops.  I mean, this is psychoanalysis, right?
It's the talk itself can have an experiential dimension to it.
And I'm sure that what Lani is talking about, for example, is a
kind of engagement that is largely oral but that is
experiential, that takes on an experiential dimension in this
transformative or conversion-like sense.  Again,
it is an empirical hypothesis--is that those
are the kinds of experiences that will make a difference.
<p>
Now for many people, I don't know which they will be.  My
deep belief is that it is researchable and it is teachable.  That's my
hypothesis about what the President's going to do over the next year,
that part of his game plan ought to be figure that out.  Find the
examples.  What's the best information we have, the kind that you two
were talking about, about the kinds of discussions in
institutions and communities and so forth that will
work, and then write it down in a tool, put it on the Internet,
whatever, and hope that there will be leaders around the country who
will read it and use it as a resource to help them do this thing.
<p>
As to whether or not the object
of the group deliberation engagement should be explicitly
race-related or not, I'm agnostic.  My guess is--again, a buoyant
--not to be reductionist--is that there should be some of both; that
--like, I mean, I'll tell you, if you're trying to
do it around schools in Boston, race is going to be about three
microns beneath the surface, and so that the leadership of that group
is going to have to have a strategy for figuring out how to deal
with race.  It's not that we sit down and we say, `What do you all
think about the Gettysburg Address'--I mean--sorry--`the Emancipation
Proclamation?' It's not--you know, it's not talking about race
explicitly in that sense, but it's being very clear, being very
self-conscious about the fact that we have different communities here
and we need a strategy for figuring out how to create some affinities,
how to create some connections.
<p>
RODIN:  Thomas?
<p>
THOMAS BENDER:  Could I just--along this line, to change it a little
bit, I think, obviously, there are a variety of ways in which
people can change, ranging from psychoanalytic model to the more
behavioral experiential and actually doing things.  My inclination is
that doing something political that brings different people together
ought to be favored, actually--but that's neither here nor there.  There
seems to be an
assumption in a lot of the discussion, and I don't know whether I'm
right in my nervousness about it, but it seems to have a logic
that first, you've got to get people in a kind of agreement on the
question that divides them, and then they can work together and other
things will proceed.  It may be just the opposite, in fact; that you
have to have people learn that there is a distance between one's
private self and one's civic self.  And you don't have to have a
perfect match.  You can't be wildly out of sync, but
you don't have to have everyone purified before they can actually
participate in the civic sphere.  And what we need to have is a place,
a civic sphere, in which people who aren't in total agreement--this is
the problem with republicanism and some versions of
communitarianism--there is this space that is
--however you want to characterize that--that makes for a civic
dialogue, then, after a reasonable amount of success, building some
social trust--I mean, ultimately, we have to get at these
issues, because some of them are quite malignant, but not all of them.
Some of them are just differences.  And I think that it may well be
the process works the other way around; that the building of
a certain degree of social trust out of working--and, again,
whether or not it's directly a racially inflected issue, although
there are few that aren't, or some other issue in the society
that that's where the preparation work for the kind of--well,
it's the psychoanalytic work yet to come--that there's a transference
issue here.
<p>
RODIN:  Go ahead, Rochelle.
<p>
ROCHELLE GURSTEIN:  This follows on what Jean Elshtain was saying
about sort of the bad condition of conversation today, and I was
thinking about--I have been reading Dr.  Johnson lately or Haslett on
Northcoats and their conversations and how conversation in the 18th
and 19th century was this polite art--that's how they thought of
it--and that it wasn't about deliberation--at least, it doesn't seem
to me that's what they were doing.  It was about being witty and
charming and having something to say.  And I was thinking about James
Fishkin's presentation last time about preparing people before they
just talk, that that seems to be something that we haven't talked
about at all.  And people come together if--
those of us who teach in schools know that you
have to--in a seminar, unless everyone's done their reading, there's
not a lot to talk about, or it's not very interesting.  And that might
be something, that a conversation metaphor, at least the way people
thought of it in the 18th and 19th century--it was a social, polite
art that was about being witty and reporting back on events of the
day, and it wasn't at all problem-solving.  I mean, that was the last
thing they would have thought that was dull or not the
thing that you're supposed to do.  So I think that whole idea of
conversation needs to be refocused and that if we want people to be
able to talk, we have to imagine they're going to have something
shared.  And I think the deliberation that you showed us last time was
perfect for showing that, that it raised the whole level of what was
possible.
<p>
RODIN:  Claude, last question.
<p>
STEELE:  Yeah, I was going to endorse the trend that this
discussion is taking, as a psychologist, I'm
biased toward the fact that attitudes and values
often follow behavior as much as precede behavior, and
so in any of these complex domains like this, I think if
where controversy has the potential to split
things apart, this is a very valuable and useful approach.  But
it's--coming from California, it almost feels a bit like a luxury
now, because we're in a sort of an all-out war to maintain the policy
at all, or any kind of commitment to the policy.
<p>
And I think it's that that has sort of shoved the
issue up into the very general kind of principled, valued debate
and arguments over all kinds of things that makes progress on
the sort of everyday, pragmatic, institutional life much more
difficult to see.  And it's in this domain where
the President, I think, has some effect,
where very forceful, clear, national leadership
on this even leadership that would expose him, maybe, to a little
political risk would be a dramatic demonstration in
behalf of this.  And then we could get back to the business of
how to do it down on the ground level.
<p>
RODIN:  We will go back to leadership in Paul's
discussion and in the next session.  Let me end, if I may take the
luxury of that, by reframing it back, Chris, to part of a
broader set of questions with regard to attitudes and behavior.
It is the case, as psychologists have known as Claude has
indicated, that the more specific the question, the more specific the
attitude, the more closely it's correlated with a real behavior when
you get to questions that are asked that sound more normative,
the paradigmatic social psychology experiment during the period
of major Chinese immigration--you know, if a Chinese couple came to
your house, would you invite them in?  And 97 percent of the
population says yes, and then the experiment was actually
conducted and 14 percent of the people actually ever let them in.
And so there really is--when you have that kind of disconnect, and the
data are very clear there, one wonders what is really driving behavior
and whether it's useful to look at attitudes at all.  You have been
arguing in a very civic-minded way that there are people waiting to be
led, that there are well intentioned as well as possible citizen leaders
waiting for the new kind of
language and the new kind of model that would allow them.  That
may be true, and there may be some or many such individuals.  Maybe
there are also people who really do, to get back to Edna's point, even
on this issue of race, hate one another and are truly intolerant and
really feel unable to like one another or work together or come
together, and that's producing some of the rhetoric and some of the
intolerance.  If that is true, what do we do about that?
<p>
EDLEY:  I think there are two things.  First, it does seem to me
that this is an issue--race, color--I mean, the seeds were planted
long before the revolution.  And in some respects, our difficulties
over color antedate many of the civic values, political values that
are the rest of your conversation.  So immediately, it's quite clear
that this is a very deep problem and has the
potential to challenge those civic values.
<p>
Nevertheless, going back to Derek's point earlier, it's the equality
norm has taken hold, at least as aspiration.  There are resources
available that can be tapped to bring to bear on this challenge as
ancient as it is.  Tolerance and, indeed, community are, I think, part
of our political culture, part of
our ideal, and that's not true of every society on the
planet.  And in too many subcommunities within America, that's falling
apart.  But it does seem to me that the first answer to your question
is:  A leader has to make a decision--and we had this conversation
with the President.  You've got different kinds of Joe
Six Packs sitting on bar stools.  Some of them may be confused about
the facts.  Some of them may be confused because they have different
ideals about the kind of community they want to live in.
Some of them may be bigots.  They're just racists, and they're proud
to be racists.  When you're talking, are you trying to talk to all of
them?  Are you trying to engage all of those Joe Six Packs?
<p>
My proposition is that, yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  Is
that not necessarily within the expectation that they will agree,
that you will convert them, that you will trim your sails in order to
plead with them, to get them to agree with you, but still,
with the notion that there will always be an open door to come into
the community and that, therefore, there has to be a continuing
engagement with them.  So that's part one.  Continuing engagement--no
outlaws in this exercise.
<p>
The second point is that I think that the
analytical exercise of trying to understand the disagreements in
empirical understandings and in value
commitments that animate our disagreements is useful for two reasons.
It's useful both because, I mean, maybe we can shake up this fight
about merit.  With respect, you've got me wrong on merit.  I'm in favor
of merit.  I probably have a different view of merit from yours.
Let's argue about why we have different views of merit.
Let's at least get our disagreement straight respectfully and go on
from there.  But it's also important analytically to understand what's
at stake, because there, I think, you can identify what kind of
project of connecting communities is going to be needed in order to
change those values, change those empirical understandings.  It tells
you the kinds of experiences and information that need to be added to
the civic discourse, to the civic experience in order to try to
find that common ground, to use that expression.
<p>
The summary on that second point, then, is I use the
expression `searching for the kernel of truth in what the other side
is saying'--that if I can approach a discussion--a complicated issue
like this, prepared to search for the kernel of truth in what the
other person is saying, then it seems to me, then, I'm entitled to
insist that they do the same with respect to me.  No outlaws; search
for the kernel of truth.  Thanks. <p>

RODIN:  I'd like to thank Chris for an extraordinarily nuanced
talk.  So take a 10-minute break and then return.
