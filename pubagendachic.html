The June 1998 plenary meeting of the Penn National Commission on Society,
Culture and Community was entitled <b>"Leading the Conversation: 
Leadership in a Democratic Society."</b> This meeting built on the
Commission's work and advanced its investigations into two of its primary
areas of interest -- public discourse and leadership -- in an integrative
framework.  The plenary and working sessions focussed on discourse
leadership, emphasizing how national leaders frame questions for public
discussion, the special roles and responsibilities of professionals, and
principles for discourse leadership in the public realm.
