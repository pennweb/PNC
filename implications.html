            <blockquote>

                The Commission's findings and continuing research projects have clear
                implications for those who would seek to encourage real change in the
                conduct of public discourse:
                <blockquote>
                    First, the aim of such efforts must be the promotion of productive
                    discourse, not the condemnation of uncivil discourse.
                    <p>
                        Second, such efforts must be broadly conceived if they hope to counteract
                        the large-scale and long-term social, technological, and economic dynamics
                        that have influenced the conduct and content of public discourse.
                        <p>
                            Third, such efforts must target the key leadership cadres and emerging
                            institutions that have real potential for effective discourse leadership
                            and the creation of inclusive, stable discourse communities across
                            boundaries of difference and isolation.
                            <p>
                                Fourth, rather than promoting a single technique or format, such efforts
                                must disseminate a wide variety of concrete models and principles for
                                exemplary public discourse that can be used by the growing list of civic
                                organizations and discourse programs devoted to the improvement of public
                                debate and discussion on important public issues.
                                <p>
                                    Fifth, such efforts will be most effective if they build ideas about "best
                                    practices" in discourse leadership into the professional and institutional
                                    cultures of the target audiences.
                                    <p>
                                        Sixth, in tandem with the focus on key institutions and leadership cadres,
                                        such efforts should take advantage of the perceptible (e.g., in response
                                        to the Impeachment process) public yearning for more productive norms of
                                        public behavior and discourse to create a widely dispersed national
                                        movement that takes on a life of its own as it permeates the society to
                                        promote a more positive discourse culture,
                                        <p>
                                            Finally, such a movement will need to create more visible and powerful
                                            models of effective discourse principles and practices, if it hopes to
                                            influence either the general public or the busy professionals and complex
                                            institutions that actually organize and lead public discourse.

                </blockquote>

                    These key conclusions and implications have shaped our goals and plans for
                    programmatic activities designed to improve the actual conduct of public
                    discourse in the United States, which will get underway following the
                    final plenary meeting of the Commission in November 1999. If leaders,
                    institutions, universities, and students all come together, we believe we
                    can create a national movement for more productive, engaged public
                    discourse. As happened with community service, such a movement can start
                    in the universities and cultural institutions, yet eventually impact --
                    and permeate -- the entire society.
