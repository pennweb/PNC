It's actually with some trepidation that
I do this, since many of you know so much about universities.
And I hope that my comments really will merely give us the opportunity
to have a very robust conversation.  And I will try to say a few
things that are provocative.
<p>
Don, certainly you know from your role as provost, as I do from my
years as provost at Yale, that universities are very complicated
places, and I think many of us would imagine ourselves being able
to--and often as faculty members with horror sometimes and with
interest other times--sort of fantasized what it would be to be
the president of the university, and really get it right and
set the university right.  Well, as a faculty member who was given
that opportunity, I have to tell you that one should not always--one
should fear getting what one wishes for.  It is a very, very
complicated place.
<p>
I want to begin by talking about some issues that confronted me
early in my presidency, because I think they set the stage for much of
what we've been talking about.  I found myself beset by calls for
the university to use its very prodigious influence to condemn or shut
down or sanction racist or homophobic or other forms of outrageous
behavior.  The university was being asked to make our students behave,
to solve by executive fiat the social problems of crime or litter or
drunkenness or incivility, to name only a few, and I'd like to tell
you of three examples that occurred in the first six months of my
presidency, unrelated incidents but incidents all that deeply offended
and disturbed various members of our community.
<p>
First, many of our faculty and students were affronted by the fact
that a faculty member received research funding from an outside
foundation that was thought to support neo-Nazi and racist agendas.
Second, there was a student's really quite scurrilous essay on Haiti,
printed in a campus publication, which infuriated the Haitian
community.  And finally, a retrospective exhibit of Andreas Serano's
photographs at our Institute of Contemporary Art which included the
notorious "Piss Christ," in which the crucifix is seen submerged in
the artist's urine, and clearly brought on the predictable torrent of
condemnations.
<p>
The common cry in each of these incidents, and in many, many others
that we all confront, was, `Why doesn't the university stop this?' It
was a heartfelt demand and at, I think, a legitimate question, but I
responded negatively to most of these requests and to many others that
have followed on similar issues.
<p>
Why?  Not because I believe in the First Amendment, although I do, but
because I believe so strongly that attempts to shut down the
discourse, to civilize the debate, or even to control the sometimes
outrageous behavior of students before the fact, will not bring about
the kind of reasoned and reasonable exchange that we've been talking
about--those exchanges that we seek.  In fact, I don't think that they
will even serve to protect those who seek the university's protection
as a sign of respect or as a sign of acceptance.
<p>
They will not reduce the level of intolerance or incivility, and they
certainly will not moderate the ideological polarizations of our
politics.  And in the end, I think such measures send fundamentally
the wrong message, a message that reinforces the sense of powerless
individuals and of monolithic institutions, of cultural orthodoxy and
paternalistic authority, and of ideological conformity and political
correctness.
<p>
None of these messages is compatible with the vision of free and
robust expression or debate or engagement that is absolutely essential
to an academic community.  Tempting as the mantle of moral leadership
may be, it is too often a comfortable excuse for imposing quietude and
conformity, where raucous debate and energetic engagement should
flourish.  And I think both academic leaders and their constituencies
too often feel this temptation.  We've come a long way to rejecting
the notion in universities of in loco parentis, and yet we seem to
still have bred a culture within our universities and within the
larger society that makes it possible and, in some ways, seem to be
desirable, to transfer moral authority and responsibility from
individuals to institutions and from institutions to their most
powerful leaders.
<p>
Strange as it may seem, I believe that this may be an important part
of the reason why our leaders and our institutions are not now held in
such low esteem.  We transfer the responsibility to them, and then we
discover to our dismay that our institutions and our leaders are
failing, failing at what I think is the impossible task of taking
responsibility for everyone else's conduct and everyone else's
beliefs.
<p>
Now what can universities do?  After all, universities play a very
unique role in our society as the makers of new knowledge and the
nurturers of new interpretations.  It is our responsibility to keep
relentlessly articulating the university as a marketplace of ideas.
Those of us in universities have a special responsibility, I think,
for exercising personal as well as institutional and social
leadership.  And certainly, the larger social dimension of that fact
comes from the fact that universities really are microcosms of the
larger society, as we all know.  And so from tax policy to gays in the
military, from issues of affirmative action to current concerns about
self-segregation, from adapting to the Internet to urban development
and crime prevention, one way or other, these and so many other social
issues really do play themselves out on our campuses and must
be addressed by the institution and their leaders.
<p>
Now obviously we have some advantages that the larger society does not
have; certainly the scale is often smaller, the knowledge base and
level of understanding higher and the political pressures somewhat
less immediate, although for those of us under the microscope, they
often are quite intense.  And yet for all our advantages, we share
many of the common characteristics that come into play in any large
society.  Universities are bureaucratic; there's a great deal of
inertia; often there's public deafness, demands for participation and
input on the one hand, and resistance to change on the other hand.
<p>
Likewise, the same competing imperatives come into play.  We question
what it is we're seeking.  Is it diversity?  Is it openness?  Is it
freedom of expression?  We also ask ourselves what we value.  Is it
efficiency, humaneness, excellence?  And what is most important in
universities, civic and community responsibility, fiscal
responsibility, tradition?  Which constituencies do we respond
to--faculty, staff, students, alumni, trustees, the public, the media?
All of these compete, really, for our attention and for our moral
concurrence.
<p>
I think that there's a special problem at universities when we think
about public behavior, because the issues at universities are often
exacerbated by the energy and experimentation of youth and by the
libertarian freedom of the collegiate environment.  They're aided and
abetted by the social and economic expectations that the young may
also always want to push the envelope and break new ground.
<p>
But although the strains and conflicts of society do get reproduced on
campus on a smaller scale, I think they also have the opportunity to
be clarified and examined quite differently.  The reason for this is
that our universities have intellectual strength, and because they do,
and because they are worlds of ideas, our conflicts often come with
reasons and with arguments, reasons and arguments that, as we've seen
and talked about, really tend to get stripped away in the larger
society.
<p>
One reason I didn't intervene in the situations that I talked about is
that I think we can and we have to be much more closely engaged in
universities with the substantive heart of an issue when it arises on
a campus setting, because it's at the intellectual heart of
an issue that creative resolution will arise and develop.
<p>
And so our special ability as a university is the ability to make new
knowledge and generate new understandings, and with that special
ability, it forces upon us the social responsibility for developing
new paradigms and for thinking differently about the issues that
confront us.  Those pedagogically inclined among us really know these
moments as what we've called the �teachable moment� on a
university campus, when these issues arise, moments when the energy
and passion of the conflict combine with the honesty and the skill of
intellectual inquiry to open the possibility of a transformational
experience, something maybe we should begin to call transformative
discourse.  It is what the best of us routinely do in our classrooms.
It's what each of us searches for and prizes throughout our lifetimes.
It's the kind of discourse that surely can change a life, but I think
perhaps can also change an entire society.  How we respond to and
resolve campus conflicts sets up patterns that surely will
change our students and influence them throughout their lives.
<p>
Of course, our students do come to us as the bearers of attitudes and
as the bearers of dysfunctions that they've inherited from the society
in which they've been raised, but if we do it well, we truly are in
the business of incubating new citizens.  We're in the business of
shaping them in ways that can be at wide variance with the behavioral
patterns and the attitudes that they came to us with.  It doesn't
always happen, but it's very, very important for us to remember that
it can happen.
<p>
College at its best is exactly this kind of transformative experience,
and I argue insistently that such experiences can reshape or transform
our universities and maybe even our society as well.  Certainly it
will come as no surprise to you that in transforming our students,
we're transforming our faculty members as well, and in transforming
our students and ourselves, we surely have the opportunity to
experiment with alternative approaches, to test and to tinker, to
model the transformative experiences for the larger society.
<p>
Note that I said `experiences' and not `solutions.' I think that
solutions really are needed, but I think they're a further time in
coming, and that the beginning of the work is merely modeling the
transformational experience.  We tend so quickly to look for
resolution.  We almost did a little bit of it at lunchtime.
<p>
Let's figure out now what the end points are--struggling with
outcomes as a way of engaging in the process.  We are unlikely to find
the perfect leader or the perfect institutional environment, and
nowhere is such a vision more unrealistic, I think, than in
universities, perhaps because each year at universities a significant
portion of the population turns over.  And so it brings with it new
challenges and old challenges reborn, I think, like the locks of
Medusa's hair.
<p>
Well, there's no end to the challenges, but there is a process of
change, and it's our responsibility to foster that change.  But I
believe absolutely, fervently, that change will not occur if academic
leaders and their institutions use their authority to arbitrate the
public conversation and arbitrarily set the norms of public conduct.
Positive change can only occur where there's an openness to new ideas
and new possibilities, where robust engagement teaches by argument and
by example, rather than by dictum or domination.  The best cure for
old and dysfunctional patterns of behavior is not prohibition, but the
positive attraction of new and better modes of discourse and
interaction, and it is the academic community which should be the
hotbed of such new proposals and possibilities.
<p>
Doing so requires, actually, very little.  It requires only that we
bring to bear our enormous intellectual and scholarly resources.  If
we fail to bring that insight and expertise into play, we fail to live
up to all of our own rhetoric about the importance of research and
teaching and service.
<p>
So, confronted early in my presidency with demands for the university
to lead, or really for me to rule, I hoped instead to find a new model
of leadership, a new style of leadership, at least for myself, a style
that would take better advantage of the university's unique capacity
to produce and disseminate knowledge.  I thought, `There has to be
a better way to offer and demonstrate moral
leadership than by imitating a 600-pound elephant squashing out or
drowning out whatever behaviors or opinions it dislikes.'
<p>
Yet as so many things, when we start talking about public behavior,
and when we talk about, as we have, the quality of public discourse,
we quickly discover another way in which the college and university
environment unfortunately mirrors the society at large.  Take any
contemporary issue on campus--incivility and intolerance,
self-segregation; I've already mentioned sexual and racial
harassment, political correctness, misconduct in research--in every
case, the reality of the situation in dispute may often be quite
different, not only from how it's portrayed in the media, but also may
be very different from the exaggerations and misrepresentations and
polemicized renderings that are energizing one or sometimes both sides
to a conflict.  The real complexity and the accurate representation of
facts and opinions often gets quite distorted.
<p>
It was this very situation that led this commission over a year ago to
really call for a more reasoned and reasonable public discourse, one
in which real expertise and authority have an appropriate place, one
in which leaders offer new possibilities to their constituencies, and
one in which minds and opinions might actually be changed.  If my
experiences at Penn and at Yale have taught me anything, it's that the
foremost task of institutional leadership is to stimulate this kind of
robust and productive conversation, and never to shut down the
conversation before it starts.
<p>
To create and sustain a discourse on our campus requires several
things.  First, we've got to learn to tolerate the intolerable.  It is
the antithesis to political correctness.  Hearing the hateful is an
absolute precondition to changing it.  When faced with the hateful,
with the disagreeable, with the offensive, we really can only
eradicate it or we only have a chance to try to eradicate it if we
expose it to the light of day, to open discussion and debate.
<p>
When Penn's Haitian students were doubly offended, first at the
scurrilous magazine article itself and then by my refusal to condemn
and shut down the magazine, my office instead worked with their
faculty advisers to have a series of seminars with experts across a
wide variety of opinions and political spectra with regard to
this issue.  This was a dialogue that all of the parties were quite
reluctant at first to engage in.  Each side smoldered in the sublime
righteousness of its own position:  from the point of view of the
Haitian students, the demand for respect and accuracy, and from
the point of view of the student magazine, obviously, the freedom of
the press.
<p>

But there was an extensive public dialogue, well-attended, difficult,
feisty.  It took several months to arrange.  But in the end, those who
were most doubtful about the activity actually became the major public
proponents of the approach.  It's hard work creating and sustaining
dialogue, but I think in universities, in particular, there's no
substitute for relentless engagement.  We have to engage.  We have to
encourage others to engage.  And when our energy and patience wanes,
we have to re-engage anew.  When others get up and stomp and leave the
table, we've got to help them to re-engage, because one of the
responsibilities of universities is to demonstrate, and demonstrate
concretely, over and over again, that no matter how divided and bitter
the situation, engagement with one another, even with our enemies, is
both possible and the only road towards greater comity.
<p>
How can this be done?  We're certainly going to have much
opportunity to talk about it, but I will, as Richard did, give you a
few suggestions as I've been thinking about the issues recently.
<p>
The first proposal I would make is that we have got to diversify the
conversation.  One doesn't need to support affirmative action to
recognizing that talking only to the converted breeds arrogance and
absolutism and orthodoxy.  We cannot only talk to those people who
think the way we do.  One of the prerequisites for a robust campus
discourse is a diverse campus community, but we have to be vigilant in
reminding ourselves that diversity takes many forms.  It is
ideological and political; it has to do with athletic talent vs.
musical talent; it is social and geographic and gender, as well as
race and ethnicity.  And universities have been operating on the basis
of this more complex view of diversity for a very, very long time.
<p>
Not all forms of diversification are right for all institutions or for
all educational missions, but some form of diversity is essential.  If
we expect our students to engage in robust discourse, it's important
that they experience diversity in their daily lives, not just
encounter it in theory or encounter it as a part of a bureaucratic
regulation.  We can do it in a variety of ways--specific campus
programs that have to do with residential living, campuswide reading
projects.  There are many methodologies that are not Draconian for
really allowing our students to experience and relate to diversity.
<p>
A second recommendation is that universities must insist on engagement
with the surrounding community, whatever form that community takes,
whether it's rural or urban, poor and disadvantaged or affluent.
Colleges and universities, I think, have never been ivory towers, but
if they ever were, that certainly is the college and university of the
past.  We can't fulfill the mandate of social leadership that we
are describing on a model of an ivory-tower institution.  Community
service programs, community-based undergraduate research projects,
internships, to name only a few.  If we don't have these kinds of
programs in our universities today, then I think we fail to adequately
prepare our students for how to behave and debate and be the
citizens of the world that they'll inhabit.
<p>
They all have the multiple educational function of testing ideas in
practical contexts, diversifying intellectual perspectives, preparing
students for the world of work and the world of community.  So I would
argue that community involvement can no longer be an interesting
sideline for our universities, but really has to be a central part of
how universities see themselves going forward into the future.
<p>
Third, as I already mentioned, relentlessly--and I mean
relentlessly--articulating the vision of the university and defending
the image of the university as a marketplace of ideas.  First, if we
believe this, it provides the vision that students need in order to
understand and internalize the value of civil discourse and positive
behavior.  It is also the case that the university is one of the few
models in our society in which there is a community that really does,
I hope, hold the values of civil discourse--engagement, reflection,
openness to new ideas, disciplined inquiry; all of these are
systematically and persistently exemplified.
<p>
If nothing else, our commission discussions to date have demonstrated
the urgent need for these kinds of examples in the larger society.  It
means that all of us, not only faculty and university presidents, but
students and trustees and others associated with universities, have to
consistently articulate this vision.  It means creating new
opportunities for non-academics to participate in the dynamic of an
academic community, and that this does serve a critical societal
function that we must take on.  So such things as public programs,
lectures, opening our museums to the public, broadcast operations,
even continuing education centers, again, must be seen now as serving
more than just a peripheral institutional function in our
universities.
<p>
We ought to be providing incentives to our faculty and students to
participate widely outside of their formal instructional settings,
because in doing so we provide models of an engaged citizen engaging
in constructive and civil behavior.
<p>
Next, we have got to monitor and police our own institutional
activities.  This takes on considerable importance because some of
these activities--intercollegiate athletics being one of them--are
powerful instances of where institutional leadership can be exercised
or where it fails.  These powerful influence that these
activities have on our students, our alumni and the general public
make this a truly crucial institutional responsibility.
<p>
Next, I think that we need to play a role in revisiting standards of
professional conduct.  Our professional schools have a special
responsibility to examine their standards of conduct and examine the
standards for discourse in their professions, with an eye not only to
their internal professional roles but also with regard to their
role-model effect, the behavioral impact of their modeling, on the
larger society.
<p>
And finally, universities have got to be more mindful of helping other
social institutions function successfully.  Part of the obligation, as
I've said, is imposed on us by our knowledge and our expertise, but if
we take that seriously, then it's important for us to help other
social institutions do their job.  Again, this is part of exemplifying
the kind of positive engagement that creates a more civil discourse.
<p>
And there are many, many examples; to name only a few:  Boston
University taking over the Boston public schools; Penn has been
working to provide administrative and financial and computing and
other forms of expertise to support Philadelphia's efforts to try to
successfully revive itself into a flourishing municipality; Harvard
and Texas and Penn, to name only a few, are offering our leaders and
citizens new models for political campaigns, new models for the public
policy discussion and legislative conduct.  As experts, of course,
we've always done some of that, but we haven't consolidated within the
university the university's role to take that on, and to understand
that it is central and not peripheral to the leadership responsibility
of colleges and universities.
<p>
In the same vein, I think we shouldn't forget that the basic tasks of
good educational practice in any college or university--what do we
do?--creating small seminars, fostering one-on-one interactions with
faculty, providing undergraduate research opportunities, venues and
opportunities for discussion, cooperative laboratory work.  All of
these, if we think about it this way--and many more, obviously--teach
the skills of civil discourse and constructive behavior.  We should
not forget that what we do in our classrooms and in our laboratories
and in our seminars really demonstrate civil discourse and
constructive behavior.  That's not to say that we should just keep
doing what we're doing well, but it would be a very good start.
<p>
In putting the creation of robust discourse at the center of our
institutional values at universities, we would demonstrate the
recognition and instantiate the recognition that we cannot legislate
away bad behavior and incivility with codes or policies or
regulations.  Many of us have been attracted over the years to a
regulative approach in universities, but I think they are too fine an
instrument for the task of shaping social behavior, either in colleges
and universities or in the larger society.
<p>
In universities, I think we have to be the ones who discover or invent
other, more positive and less authoritarian means of influencing
public behavior.  How do we do that?  By modeling adherence and
respect for community norms in the broadest and most positive sense,
and not in the narrow and regulative sense.  And the only means we
have available for doing so begins with the transformative potential
of a robust conversation, set in a diverse community of many
manies--what I like to call a mosaic of value differences that
contribute to the whole.  I have never found, in thinking about
universities, the notion of a melting pot a particularly appealing
one.  I think universities have to be a mural or a mosaic, in which
the differences stand out but work well together.  The goal is not to
minimize the differences but to weave them into a tapestry that is
effective and works well, that really is greater than the sum of its
parts.
<p>
I think diversity will create debate.  It will create conflict and
controversy, and the notion of that should appeal to us.  It should
not be something that we fear or try to suppress.  As the progenitors
of new knowledge, universities have the social leadership
responsibility to create it and to use it and to model it.
<p>
But in thinking about what I wanted to say to you, I think I need
also remind us of the cold, hard truth, which is that the public
doesn't trust us the way that they used to.  We haven't done a very
good job of making our case to the public, because in many ways the
public has become weary of institutions that fail them and wary of
false promises that someday, somehow, someone really will make it all
better.  Alas, we must be, I think, as Shakespeare put it, masters of
our fates; `The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in
ourselves that we are underlings.'
<p>
It's so easy in these complex times to think of ourselves in colleges
and universities as underlings, as victims, really, unable to move or
to change the institutions and the cultural patterns that surround us,
but clearly, the fault is not in our stars.  University leaders can
and must make a difference, and I'd like to just elaborate on a few
ways that I think they can.
<p>
We can, first of all, make a profound difference by our example.
Nothing is more powerful than seeing those whom we admire or respect,
perhaps even those we fear, behave in ways that are worthy of
emulation.  We can make a difference by articulating a broad, positive
set of norms of behavior and reasonable discourse, not by narrow,
negative constraints.  We can make a difference by making sure that
clear and consistent rewards and consequences follow when norms are
ignored or advanced.  We can make a difference by imagining and then
articulating a clear identity and a clear strategic vision for our
institutions and for our society, a vision that individuals can
internalize and contribute to.
<p>
We all have a need for context and direction, and such frameworks are
among the most powerful constraints on our public behavior.  We need
to provide more such frameworks.  We can make a difference by
consistent implementation of our institutional visions.  Certainly
nothing muddies the message more than a mixed message.  Clarity and
consistency of expression and impression, what our
colleagues the political consultants call `staying on message' but
it's really important in universities.  We don't always stay on
message.  It's an important and often neglected virtue in
university leaders.
<p>
We can make a difference by clear and aggressive leadership in
response to changed circumstances.  By breaking new ground and by
forging new paradigms, we really can demonstrate that it is possible
to envisage a better future.  As we discussed last June, I think many
of us believe that that is the beginning of effecting fundamental
change.  Our colleges and universities have the capacity to stimulate
and to foster the robust conversation that we all believe must be at
the heart of our 21st-century communities.  And so we can, by our
example, promote and inculcate the civic virtues that we have talked
about--the virtues of participation and cooperation and restraint.  We
can, by example, promote the qualities of leadership that include
positive risk-taking.
<p>
But I think we can do even more.  We can also serve as models of
community.  In important respects, universities have really come to
replace many of the other mediating and voluntary institutions that
once constituted the civil society.  In the size of universities, in
their resources and internal dynamics and influence, modern
universities have come to generate forms of community and association
that weren't known in the 18th and even the early part of the 19th
centuries.  They participate in and serve as gateways to the wider
global community with whom we often now have more in common than we do
with people living on the same block, the same point I made earlier
about multinational corporations.
<p>
And if we can actualize the potential of universities to define
civility and community for the 21st century, I believe the
universities can be truly powerful forces for the opening of a robust
discourse and the changing of public culture.  Universities can set
the standards, help to describe the standards, train the leaders and
the citizens, demonstrate the rewards and provide the inducements that
really will foster the more robust and diverse and civil public
discourse that we've been talking about.
<p>
Academic leaders and their institutions really can make a difference,
but only if we explicitly undertake the task of building community by
promoting the robust conversation that has to be at its heart.  Basic
academic values that we already hold, values like respecting
complexity, posing substantive rather than rhetorical questions when
framing a discussion, welcoming real input and participation, and
holding open the possibility that we may be in error, and, of course,
refraining from ad hominum arguments--these aren't only guidelines for
good public discourse, but they create in modern colleges and
universities a readily accessible model for workable communities.  By
modeling this kind of public discourse and behavior in our colleges
and universities, I think we will have taken an important first step
towards fulfilling our leadership responsibilities.
And I'd like to conclude by commenting on five qualities that I think
are essential in leading efforts to foster both higher standards of
public discourse and also higher standards in education, and these
qualities run through and behind everything I've said today about
leaders and institutions and communities, and particularly about the
responsibilities of colleges and universities.  I think they're
applicable, though, to the tasks of leadership across society.
<p>
The first and indispensable quality of institutional and individual
leadership is courage.  If we don't have the courage to lead our
constituencies rather than follow them, I don't think any of the other
goals that we've outlined will be possible.
<p>
Second, we really do hope that our leaders have wisdom, not only the
sageness of a great thinker, but also the pragmatic ability to look
beyond the short term and the immediate to the world just beyond the
horizon.
<p>
I think that leaders must also be passionate.  You heard
resonances of this in Chris Edley's concept of relentless
teaching, something that compelled me when I heard him.  It
takes passion to be relentless, and it takes relentlessness to remain
engaged when it would be much easier to give up or give in or walk
away.
<p>
Our leaders must also have, or reach out to find, that ephemeral,
maybe, infinitely various quality that we call vision--the ability to
see and grasp the possibility for changes that really are around us.
As we discussed in June, and as I think we really all believe, people
do want to do better.  They really do.  But they need to be shown how,
and they need to learn that they're not alone in wanting to do better
and in being willing to try.  By offering our constituencies clearer
visions of what the better future we might build together look like,
we offer them something that they can subscribe to, contribute to and
work towards.  The uplift of a compelling vision, perhaps, is the
greatest force that the power of ideas can exert in motivating and
shaping and improving public behavior.
<p>
Finally, and so importantly, our leaders and our institutions must
have integrity.  Nothing is more corrosive of public culture than the
appearance of corruption, influence peddling, dishonesty or even just
a lack of authenticity.  We must hold our institutions and our leaders
to a higher standard.  When they fail to act in accord with the best
vision of their mission and purposes, I think they destroy the very
fabric of our communal existence, and we talked about that this
morning with regard to sports as well.  It's no truer there than it is
in any of the glaring episodes of misbehavior, incivility and
intolerance that surround us.
<p>
If the only thing required for the triumph of evil is that good people
do nothing, can't we turn it around and say that it may be true for
the triumph of the good over the bad that we only need to act and
commit ourselves?  By behaving in this way, we can influence our
academic institutions, and by influencing these institutions, I think
we can multiply our effectiveness a thousandfold.  We have the
opportunity--indeed, we have the mandate--to create new models of
engagement and new models of behavior.  We have the capacity through
education to change people's expectations of others and of themselves,
and I believe fervently that by changing expectations we will set in
motion, we can set in motion, a dynamic that really has the potential
to begin to change our society.
<p>
Thank you.
