          <p> The Penn National Commission seeks to foster the "reasoned and reasonable"
            discourse essential to the social, political, cultural, and community life
            of a democracy. An international group of forty-eight scholars, political
            leaders, and shapers of public opinion, convened by University of Pennsylvania
            President Judith Rodin, the Commission is meeting over a three-year period
            to understand the problems of contemporary public discussion and behavior
            and foster a more engaged and thoughtful public discourse in the 21st century.
            <p><b>The Problems of Public Discourse </b><br>
              Early in its deliberations, the Commission identified three deficiencies that
              influence public discourse and public behavior: a <b>Failure of Leadership</b>,
              in the continuing dialogue between and among leaders and constituencies; the
              <b>Fragmentation of Communities</b>, in which race, class, ideology, ethnicity,
              and special interests divide and sub-divide rather than unify civic life;
              and a <b>Culture of Intolerance</b>, expressed in the incivility, intolerance,
              and ideological polarization that dominate our public discourse.

          <p><b>Plenary Meetings</b><br>
            Six thematically linked, semi-annual plenary meetings, in Philadelphia, Washington,
            D.C., Chicago, and and Los Angeles, are being held to advance the Commission's
            deliberations and outreach activities.
            <p> <b>Working Groups</b> <br>
              Three deliberative working groups are at the heart of the Commission's research
              and programming activities: Culture and Public Behavior, Leadership in a Democratic
              Society, and 21st Century Community. Each working group is investigating one
              of the three major problem areas identified by the Commission and is developing
              educational products for professional and public audiences.
              <p><b>Research Program</b> <br>
                In its research program, the Penn National Commission has undertaken these
                three essential tasks in understanding contemporary society and culture: <br>

          <p> The Penn National Commission is engaged in an ever-widening conversation
            designed to test, refine, and disseminate the Commission's ideas. Starting
            with the membership of the Commission itself, moving outward to a network
            of emerging academic, professional, and opinion leaders, and ultimately, to
            local communities, campuses, and the general public, the Commission's public
            programs reflect the experimental nature of the Commission's inquiry. Rather
            than issue traditional reports and recommendations, the Commission invites
            its audiences to test its ideas in the actual conduct of public discourse.
            In support of these objectives, the Commission is undertaking a variety of
            informational and educational activities designed to engage a wider leadership
            and public audience in the Commission's work:
