CASS SUNSTEIN:  Since we're in Chicago, I hope you won't mind if
I tell you a University of Chicago story.  As you may know, the
University of Chicago has pathetic athletic teams, and we're
especially pathetic in rowing.  And for years, this has been a
problem.  And people have been puzzling over why our rowing team's
always finished last.  Just a month ago, one of the top members of the
crew went to the University of Southern California, which has an
outstanding rowing team--one of the best in the country--and tried to
do some investigative work to figure out why they're so much better
than we are.  And the fellow came back and said, `You know, it's the
darndest thing.  At the University of Southern California, they have
eight people who row and one who screams.' It's a sad story, and
it's relevant to our topic today.
<p>
We are very fortunate to have with us two of the leaders in the
country on issues of race and discrimination and affirmative action.
Let me say just a few words about two people who really, as they say,
don't need an introduction.  Ward Connerly is an extremely well-known
person in business, one of the leading authorities on housing in the
United States.  That's really how he made his name first, and he
became a civil rights leader relatively late.  As a member of the
University of California Board of Regents, Mr. Connerly helped lead
the attack on the University of California's race-based system of
preferences in its admissions policy.  He served later as chair of the
California Civil Rights Initiative, a successful civil rights
initiative in California ending certain forms of racial preference in
California.  He remains the president and chief executive officer of
Connerly and Associates, and he continues work on civil rights issues,
in particular on behalf of the ideal of color blindness.
<p>
William Gray has been in public life for a very long time.  He is
now the president of the United Negro College Fund, where he has been
amazingly successful in a relatively short time with that
important institution.  Before then, he served in the United States
Congress, where he was chair of the Democratic Caucus, majority whip
and chair of the House Budget Committee.  Mr. Gray had a lot of
impact on the country, especially because of his interest in
education, and he did a great deal of work on behalf of strengthening
our educational processes and systems.  We're fortunate--very
fortunate to have two disparate--people of disparate views who are
really among the nation's most important and influential figures with
respect to civil rights.
<p>
Now as most of the people in the room know but as our two guests may
not have been focused on, our day has been spent discussing not so
much issues of affirmative action as issues of how to discuss issues
like affirmative action.  What we've especially attended to is the
distinction between an effort to persuade, or a performance, and an
effort to learn, or conversation.  And what we've been trying to
attend to is how there's a place in public and private life for
performance, which is often what television is about, but there's also
a place in public life, as well as in private life, for a conversation
in which people try to learn things from one another.
<p>
So our hope is that this will not be in any way a debate about whether
affirmative action is a good idea or not, but instead a discussion of
how people might exercise leadership in a nation that is divided on
the issue of affirmative action as it is on other issues of race.  So
the topic is, in a way, affirmative action, but more generally, the
topic is how to discuss issues of race in a polarized--sometimes
dangerously polarized nation.
<p>
We're going to have very much a collective discussion, but for a
while, I'll operate as moderator.  And what I'd like to begin with is
just a simple question, which is, both of you have been involved
for a long time in very intense public debates about civil rights
issues.  Might you be able to recall times in which people with whom
you disagree have convinced you of something or persuaded you of
something or helped you learn something that you didn't believe before
in a way that modified your own position or changed it or at least led
it to be recharacterized in your own minds?  Maybe we'll begin with
Mr. Connerly.
<p>
WARD CONNERLY:  The answer is yes.  I take the position that
treating any citizen differently because of some attribute, such as
color, ethnicity, gender, whatever, sexual orientation, is morally
wrong, because we are all endowed with certain rights, and that
government doesn't have the ability--should not have the ability to
deprive us of those rights.  And so as a moral principle, I have tried
to religiously hold the line on that position.
<p>
However, I was on a plane, as I am often on a plane, and someone
shared with me a story involving a ferry that was closed down in--I
believe it was Georgia.  And it was closed down by the county
commission there solely to deprive black people of the opportunity
of going into the main city there, county seat, to vote.  And although
this issue--it was one in which most of the people who lived in the
county seat were not responsible for the action that had been taken, I
modified my position that there was a compelling
circumstance in which the county would be justified in giving some
special consideration to people who lived on the other side of that
river but who were unable to come to the county seat to avail
themselves of the services there because--solely because of color.
They had been deprived of that.  And so I found my position being
modified as a result of facts that were brought to my attention.  And
it hasn't changed me in the main focus that I have, but it has
caused me to--to pause for just a moment and to recognize that there
are circumstances which may not fit my perfect world as I
craft it in my own mind.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Mr. Gray.
<p>
WILLIAM H. GRAY III:  I've been thinking, since you asked the question,
have I ever had someone point out something to me that's changed my
view on race and the whole issue here in the United States, and the
answer would probably be yes.  I'm a product of two Americas.  I grew
up in the South, Louisiana and Florida, in the '40s and the '50s, and
then I spent my teen-age years in the City of Brotherly Love and
Sisterly Effectiveness, we like to say.  And so my life has been
shaped to a great degree by the whole issue of race because of where I
was born and where I lived and my family experiences.
<p>
And I suppose what became a defining moment for me was a debate that
took place in the '50s and the early '60s on the issue of race.  And
that debate was a debate between two individuals about strategies, and
they were Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.  And they had a very
profound effect upon me.  The bottom line is, I ended up on the
strategy side of Martin Luther King as opposed to the strategy side of
Malcolm X, even though Malcolm's analysis in many ways I totally
agreed with, and the depth of that analysis in understanding how
deeply embedded and insidious racism was.  It was not a pretty picture
he painted, and most Americans resented his language.  And, of course,
Martin was much more conciliatory, but if you listen very carefully
and if you knew Martin Luther King as I knew him--he lived in our
home; our families were friends for three generation--you also knew
that Martin's interpretation was very deep and also recognized the
insidious nature of racism.
<p>
But I think one of the things that Martin did for me was to help me to
understand personally that the strategies for dealing with the problem
had to be strategies that came from high moral ground and a sense of
real justice, and also, they had to be inclusive and they had to be
strategies that could regenerate a new society without alienating
the rest of the society and trying to--in a Baptist term, to sort of
redeem those who held strongly racist views, and that if there was
not that redemption that you would have a permanently torn society, no
matter what you got in terms of achieving the goals.  And so when I
think of influence, I would say it was Martin Luther King Jr.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Is there anything symmetrical to what Mr. Connerly
said, where the recent attack on affirmative action has made you
recharacterize what it is that you're for or made you think, in some
circumstances, what's been done hasn't been a good idea, anything like
that?
<p>
GRAY:  No, not at all.  I have a very strong view that most of
the discussion about affirmative action is a political discussion.
It's not based on fact.  It's not based on reality.  It appeals to
emotions, and--as most of the race debate in America has been
throughout our history.  And that's why, you know, we have the
question of leadership on race in America.  You usually do not hold
debate about race.  It's something that takes place in America's
political arena.  If you go back to the Colonial days, there's been
very little of it that's been led by moral leaders, and that includes
the church.  And I am a minister; remember that--or even from the
academy.  But the whole debate has primarily been a political debate
from day one.  The South vs.  the North, free vs.  slave, the American
Colonization Society in the 1820s, slavery.
<p>
And so, from my point of view, in this debate, as I've heard the
debate and looked at it, what has been surprising to me is how little
people pay attention to facts and how little people pay attention to
the other standards we apply to the rest of the society and how we
want to have one standard for one group and another standard for the
rest of the society.
<p>
Let me give you an example.  The use of the word `preference,' when
all of us who are in higher education--and I was a professor at five
universities before going to Congress--we all know that preferences in
higher education have existed and continue to exist, whether it's
alumni, whether it's athletic, whether it's special talent, whether
it's in state, out of state.  And why suddenly this one, quote,
"preference," which is based upon a compensatory action rooted in our
history that is trying to correct an injustice that has been done in
the past?
<p>
No, I haven't heard anything that's been surprisingly new in the
debate on affirmative action that has changed any viewpoint of mine.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  OK.  Mr. Connerly, this may give you a chance to
answer that, if you choose to.  And my thought is that there
are two things that were just said that you might agree with,
actually.  One has to do with appeals to emotions and the other is not
based on facts.  You say there is some discussion of the
possibility that California will discuss the civil rights initiative
again, that it will be ballot on the ballot again and California
will go through the process again.  Now if that happens--let's just
assume it's going to happen, even if that's a false assumption.
If it were to happen again, how would you like the debate--putting the
substance to one side, how would you like the debate to be
conducted so there would be a better debate?
<p>
CONNERLY:  Well, first of all, let me just say that while we
really don't want to debate affirmative action or preferences,
depending on which term you choose to use--and I believe that they are
different.  I believe that there are affirmative action programs that
most people of goodwill will embrace.  And when we apply different
standards to people on the basis of traits such as color or whatever,
that, to me, is a preference.  And so I'm not using the term
`preference' as a pejorative term to try to influence the debate my
way.  To me, there are differences, and I think that we can
demonstrate that very easily.
<p>
Now if that initiative that is being circulated were to find itself on
the ballot, rather than the debate being framed as one of affirmative
action or preference, I would prefer, as I did initially, to have that
debate framed in the context of race, in the context of
citizenship--what are the rights and responsibilities that flow from
citizenship?  In terms of community, how do we maintain a community
with different people in that community being defined, classified, on
the basis of some trait, such as color, ethnicity, sex, national
origin?  Those traits are not the same as other kinds of traits that
may be just as bad, but they are traits over which someone may have
some control.  So there are differences in those traits.
<p>
I'd like to see it defined in terms of identity.  Do we want a state,
do we want a nation, in which people are defined in these
arbitrary boxes in which we're using 19th-century biological concepts
to adopt 21st-century social policy?  I would frame it in terms of
those broader issues rather than trying to frame it in terms
of preferences or affirmative action, because I think that's
very limiting.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Mm-hmm.  OK.  Now as you phrase it that way,
that way of phrasing it is kind of a guarantee that you'd
win.  So--which maybe good, maybe not.  The question is,
would that be good independent of the fact that it would make the
moral badness of what you're against clear?
<p>
CONNERLY:  I'm not sure that it's a guarantee that I would win.
I think that one could make the case--although I would reject it, I
think that one could make the case that in American society,
citizenship is, in fact, defined by--or at least the benefits which
flow from citizenship, to some extent, are defined by these
characteristics that society does arbitrarily put us in these boxes
and, therefore, since it puts us in these boxes, it has a duty to kind
of self-correct the boxes into which it places us, and that identity
is, in fact, who we are.  Now that's the argument, frankly, that many
people are using right now, that race matters.  I grew up in a period
in which we were told, as JFK said on June 11th of '63, race has
no place in American life or law.  Since then, however, I think that
we've been practicing the notion that race matters.  You have to use
race to get beyond race.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Hey, can I--we saw a TV clip in which you said you
were in favor of affirmative action but against preferences.
Would you explain what the content of the thing you're for
when you say you're for affirmative action?
<p>
CONNERLY:  For example, to have the University of California
conduct outreach programs into areas where there are high
concentrations of low- and moderate-income people who are going to
ratty schools, who do not have access to the advanced placement
courses, whose teachers are burned out, where they are faced with
drugs all the time--to go into those kind of settings and to try to do
what we can to help make those kids competitively admissible--that is
affirmative action.  That is totally acceptable, even if we know that
in going there, we're going to a school or a community which is
predominantly blue, purple, green, whatever.  That is affirmative
action.
<p>
However, when those students apply and we say, as we do, as we did at
the University of California at San Diego, `If you are a historically
underrepresented minority, you get 300 bonus points.' That isn't
affirmative action; that is a preference.  That's the distinction that
I draw.  Different standards to people on the basis of their race at
the time that they're applying to the institution--which, by the way,
the courts have said is unconstitutional, except for trying to achieve
diversity, and race, then, can only be one of many factors.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  OK.  As a follower of the Supreme Court, what you
said is completely accurate.  So it's a notation from a
constitutional lawyer.  Mr. Gray, I'd like to ask you to say
something about what you would like the debate in California to look
like if it were to be a good exercise in public discussion.  And
what I'm trying to get at is, is there a way to do it that
distracts from, you know, a way of conducting the debate so it pushes
one position rather than another?
<p>
GRAY:  Well, let me just say, I agree with Ward Connerly in his
eschatological view of what the end ought to be, and that is that the
end society we would all love to have is a society where people are
judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their
skin, as often people quote Martin Luther King Jr.  But it's funny
that none of them have ever--who quote him and use that phrase to
argue that the goal ought to be immediately to eliminate race and
gender in American society and criteria--they've never really read all
of his works.  Because if you look at page 134 of "Why We Can't Wait,"
he has a very interesting statement, and I'll paraphrase it.  He says
in order to build the better society and the beloved community, you
are going to have to have compensatory efforts and preferences.  Yes,
he uses the words "preferences." And he also goes on to say, he is--he
was amazed in the 1960s about how many friends would get upset when he
used the word `compensatory efforts' or `preferences' to make up for
the past injustice.  Otherwise, he argued, you would have a divided
society that would not be moral, that would be unjust.
<p>
I agree with Ward.  I'd love to have an America where my skin color
didn't matter or the skin color of my children or the gender of women
did not matter, that there was equal pay, equal opportunity.  But the
fact of the matter is, we don't.  And it's rather Pollyanna and
Utopian for me at age 57 to sit around and act like in America, that's
the America that we have; it's a level playing field.  And my
analysis, I think, would be quite different from Ward's on that point.
And it is from that point that you develop the whole debate.  If you
think it's a color-blind society, where race doesn't matter, gender
doesn't matter, then your strategies for producing the moral society,
where race and color are not a factor, will be totally different.
Except in the world I live in and when I look at the statistics, no
matter what they are, whether it's the bank lending statistics with
regard to mortgage declination rates, whether it's hate crimes in
America and where they are directed at, whatever the indices you wanna
look at, there is clearly a significant difference based upon race in
this country.  I could ignore that and say, `Well, we're gonna produce
the color-blind and the moral society and ignore these realities and
let's say, "Race, gender should not count at all."'
<p>
The problem with that is this, in education, for instance:  If, on
the other hand, you don't deal with the preferences, or the legacies,
as they are sometimes called, such as alumni, where, in some schools,
the alumni acceptance rate is 40 percent compared to the 20 percent of
the normal applicant base--then what you do is, if you look at that,
you say, `Well, how many blacks and Latinos graduated from Harvard,
Yale, Stanford, UCLA 20 years ago or 30 years ago?' If you continue
that preference, then you build into the structure and the system a
mechanism that will not allow the diversity to occur, unless you take
into consideration--and the courts, I believe, did rule, at least in
Bakke--now I know Hopwood has a different decision, but they're not
the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court, I don't think, has yet
reversed Bakke--that race can be a legitimate issue to be looked at
among many.
<p>
From my position, as I understand affirmative action in higher
education, all we are saying is, that ought to be one issue that ought
to be considered--not the defining issue.  And so from my point of
view, what I see is a debate about race that is off kilter, does not
look at the fundamental realities and the facts of life.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  OK, good.  What you said about
the Supreme Court is actually identical and also correct, so
there's-considerable agreement...
<p>
GRAY:  No, I think he said something different.  No, no.
I wish we had a tape; we could roll it.  But I think he did say
what I said, but he prefaced it by saying that the court had ruled
against race.  Hopwood, yes, OK?  But the Supreme Court says that race
can be.
<p>
My point--let's get that.  My point is that if you allow the
preference of alumni to exist, then what you end up doing is creating
a society where blacks, Latinos and women will not get the equal
opportunity to get into those institutions.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  OK, good.  Good.  OK, good.  Now really,
the positions have been stated very articulately for and
against affirmative action, but this isn't meant as a debate--now we
have the positions on the table--about affirmative action.  It's a
debate about how to talk about issues of race.  And you were in the US
Congress.  Can you say something...
<p>
GRAY:  And that's what I'm saying to you is, the
discussion about race in America is usually not based on fact, and
that was my point.  I wasn't arguing affirmative action.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  I see.
<p>
GRAY:  That's why I compared alumni preference to the issue of
race.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Where--the missing fact is the absence
of--What?--data on the existence of preferences that aren't themselves
racial?  That's what you'd want to see much more in the debate?
<p>
GRAY:  No, I think that we need to really have a factual debate
and look at the facts of what happened and what's happening to people
in 1998 who happen to be of color, whether it's in education or
whether it's in any other area of our society and...
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Would you like...
<p>
GRAY:  And what you would see if you had those facts?  You would
see huge discrepancies and gaps.  And even though we would say that
we're 30 years away from the civil rights era, you would ask the
question, `Why do these gaps persist?  Why do we have these huge
gaps?' Now I'm not talking about affirmative action; I'm just talking
about everywhere, whether it's in lending from banks, whether it's in
public service, jobs--the whole area.  And we usually don't take a
look.  Some in academia do it, but their reports don't get debated,
usually, in the halls of Congress or in public policy.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  And we academics are extremely sad about that.
<p>
CONNERLY:  If I might comment again, I don't want to--I
didn't think we wanted to debate the issue of...
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  No.
<p>
CONNERLY:  ...affirmative action or preferences or whatever
or--to talk about process.  And what we're seeing here, really, is the
kind of exchange that makes it very difficult for us to
to close escrow on an issue like this, because we don't
often--and I'm not accusing Bill of this--but we don't come to the
table presuming the goodwill of the other person.  We believe that one
is out to protect his or her interest along racial lines and that the
other is politically inspired, that's--th--that makes it difficult for
parties to ever come together, number one, because I think that--that
most of us who are involved in this are of goodwill and do have just
different perspectives, but we want to achieve the same thing.
<p>
Secondly, even when there is a possibility of closing escrow that is
staring us in the face, we're so locked in our respective positions
that we're incapable of seizing upon where we agree and
saying, `OK, let's take our agreement and back up from there.'
For example, he made a very important statement.  `I agree
with Ward on the outcome.' All right.  If we agree on the outcome,
then how do we get to that outcome?  What are the obstacles in the way
that prevent us, as a society, from getting to where you and I have
agreed we want to go?  And let's talk about--whatever the issue is,
let's talk about where we want to be and what we have to do to allow
us to get there.  How long should it take us to get there?  What are
the obstacles we need to remove?  And it seems to me that if we
focused on that process rather than continuing to rehash where we
disagree--because we would be here until the cows
come home talking about his assessment of facts and my assessment of
facts.  And we could both probably make a pretty good case that our
perception of facts is pretty solid.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  OK.  What you just said relates to an issue that a lot
of us are interested in, which is the overwhelming dominance of the
issue of affirmative action over other race-related issues.  And both
of you--this is a common ground--both of you have pointed to issues
other than affirmative action as extremely important.  Can you say
first, why it is that affirmative action dominates everything else?
And second, what might be done to link the discussion of affirmative
action to other racial issues on which seemingly disparate people
might coalesce?
<p>
CONNERLY:  First of all, I think that the issue of affirmative
action preferences, not generically affirmative action, came
up in the context of a specific abuse at the University of California.
That is why I got involved in it, because as a fiduciary, as a regent,
sentenced to a 12-year unpaid term, when I saw that we were doing
things that clearly were unconstitutional and our general council was
saying, `Some of these things are questionable'--we had
memos to that effect--I had no choice but to deal with affirmative
action preferences as they existed.
<p>
Now from that, however, I think that we peel back the onion, we begin
to see, why is it that the disparity between black kids and Asian
kids, for example, is so great?  What is causing that inequity?  Is it
race-based?  In some cases, yes, it is.  How do we deal with that in
permissible ways?  And I think that those on both sides
of the aisle would be able to deal with that.  We also
begin to see, for example, as a result of the exposure of that issue,
that the number of students who declined to check the boxes at the
University of California went from 2,200 to 6,400 in one year.
<p>
Now is this suggesting, for example, that there is a groundswell
among students who don't like the practice of checking these silly
little boxes?  Is there something that's going on here about people
being uncomfortable with this whole business of being classified
by race?  Is there--are there demographic changes in terms of
the number of students who are coming from interracial, interethnic
marriages; therefore, they don't like the whole classification of--of
race?  There are a lot of things that are emerging out of
that that are race-related that if we begin to deal with those, it
might help us get to the whole question of affirmative action and all
of these other things that are related to it.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  This is--we have a couple of points I want to
underline.  One is Mr. Gray's suggestion that there has to be factual
accuracy both with respect to employment and educational practices and
with respect to the social consequences of color blindness, and that's
an important point.  And Mr. Connerly's suggestion, also important,
that debates often break down when the goodwill of the
adversary's drawn into question.
<p>
Can I...
<p>
GRAY:  I really would like to respond, even though I know
Ward was not talking about me in goodwill breaking down.  The answer I
thought I gave to the question--and maybe I went too long--Baptist
ministers and former members of Congress are prone to do that--was to
say I agreed with him in the ultimate that we'd like to have the
color-blind society.  Where the disagreement and the debate--what I
was trying to say--emerges is the perception of where we are today,
because that will influence what strategies you take to get to that
society.  That's what I was talking about.  It was not an attack upon
anybody's views.  I simply said I agreed with him on we would like to
have a color-blind society, a gender-neutral society.  However, what
strategies you support and don't support, whether you support
affirmative action or whether you don't support affirmative
action is rooted in your perception of where we are and what's the
best way to get to that end.
<p>
CONNERLY:  Bill, I didn't see that as an attack.  I was
just--yeah...
<p>
GRAY:  No, I just wanted to--but in case somebody later
hears this, I want to make sure that people understood what I was
saying.  So it's a process.  And I guess what I'm saying is that as
one who's been involved in civil rights for 30-some years, I find that
there're basically three groups of people in the race debate:  what I
call optimists, what I call the pessimist, or the cynic, and those who
I'd probably put in the middle, are realists.  The optimists believe
that the problems are so diminished that we're almost there and
almost--inevitably, just a few more years, we're gonna make it and you
really don't need to do much.  It's there.  It's almost there.  The
cynic and the pessimist are those who think we're never gonna get
there and that racism is so embedded in the society, in every
institution, every structure, among both groups, blacks and whites,
that the gulf cannot be spanned.  And then I think there's a--probably
a third general viewpoint of your analysis of race in America, which
is probably somewhere in between.  We've made some substantial
progress, but we still have significant way to go to deal with all the
residues that are left.  And I welcome the debate, but I want to--I
think what you've gotta look at is how do you view America.  If you
view it as color-blind, we're there, your strategies, what you will
support and what you won't support, where you stand in that debate
will be defined by that understanding.  That's all I'm saying.
<p>
JUDITH RODIN:  I'd like to try to answer your question.  I
think that affirmative action is a political debate--I agree with Bill
Gray on that--and that it's more comfortable to have political debates
in our society, whether we like the rhetoric around them our not, than
it is to have debates about fundamental issues like race and that it
is a surrogate, in a way, and that's why we're spending so much time
and thinking so much about it, for these more fundamental issues that
we're uncomfortable speaking about.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Mr. Gray, I'd like to ask you, really, a question
like the one that was just addressed by President Rodin.  That
is, why is it, in your view, that affirmative action is so salient in
public debate?  And why--and how could it be that the racial issue
might be broadened in public discussion so we'd focus on such things
such as, for example, the earned income tax credit or nutrition for
children?
<p>
GRAY:  Well, I think one of the things that we really don't want
to face in our society in that whole debate of race is what
I--remember I said facts, the reality.  We create myths.  We preachers
know more about that than anybody else, probably.  And, of course,
some of us, as we get older, we create myths.  You know, if you listen
to Bill Gray, I'm the one who taught Dr. J the tomahawk dunk, I used
to have a 38-inch vertical leap when I was going to Simon Gratz.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Me, too.
<p>
GRAY:  Hope no one's here from Philadelphia.  But that's my myth,
and it gets bigger.  One of the myths that we have is, we have a
collective myth about who we are as Americans.  And the fundamental
fact is, if you go back through our history, the biggest, toughest
political debates we've ever had in this country have been on race.
The bloodiest war we ever fought in this country was on race.  No, it
was not economic determinism.  It was not westward expansion.  The
fundamental problem of the Civil War was the issue of race.  Two
societies built different.  And even the one that was fighting against
the other had serious problems on the issue of race.  If you go back
to the Constitution, one of the biggest debates that the Founding
Fathers had was on how do you count black folk?  And that was one of
the biggest problems of the constitutional convention in the United
States of America.
<p>
So, therefore, it has always been a politically based--and I'm not
saying that those who have a different view from me are motivated by
politics, but it is to understand that that's where the
debate is rooted.  And so it's interesting that in order to get a
debate on the race of--the issue of race, it had to come out in a
public referendum, 209.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Well, why is it affirmative action rather than...
<p>
GRAY:  Well, I'm not castigating, you know...
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Yeah.
<p>
GRAY:  ...it's--but that's logical.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  But why affirmative action rather than 6,000 other
racial issues?
<p>
GRAY:  Because, clearly, if you look at the discussion and debate
about race in America, its subtleties in the last 15 years, it has
been progressing rapidly toward just that.  If you go back and look at
the discussions that were being held in Congress when I was there, oh,
it was coded, but it was about race, and everybody knew it was about
race.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  But you could have a racial discussion.  It would
--it's odd, isn't it, that the country's so focused on affirmative
action?  I think both of you agree that the notion that--both of you
think affirmative action's an important issue, but the notion that
should dominate every other issue...
<p>
GRAY:  Well, every now and then, you get an issue that becomes
the focal point of the racial debate.  It comes and goes.  Sometimes
it's a bus--a yellow bus.  Sometimes it's welfare.  Sometimes it's,
quote, "urban, inner-city crime," drugs.  And if you listen to the
debate very carefully and then you--it just moves along.  And
these debates, especially in the last few years, have been very
vigorous.  And if you listen very carefully, the issue of race is
there.
<p>
Now what has often happened in those debates--facts get shared,
studies and reports get done and sometimes, they are lessened or they
get resolved, a compromise.  I mean, affirmative action was basically
a compromise.  It was a compromise basically on how you're gonna have
some compensatory action to redress 350 years of slavery and
segregation in America.  And, you know, first Kennedy came along and
said, `I'm gonna end--an executive order--discrimination in the
executive branch and start a committee.' Then Johnson came along and
said, `Well, I can't get Congress to pass anything, but I can stop
discrimination in the entire federal government.' And then Richard
Nixon came along, influenced by the black Muslims and black
capitalism, with the idea that the way you get black folks in the
mainstream is get 'em there economically.  And so he came along with
Arthur Fletcher and started what is the model of today's affirmative
action by expanding the executive order of Johnson to include
outside contractors with goals and a timetable.  And that's where that
came from.  But if you listen to the debate that's going on around the
issue, you would almost see it as a liberal-conservative debate.
Now the last time I looked, I don't think people called Richard
Milhous Nixon a liberal.  And that may not change your
position on the issue and where you stand, but we ought to have a
factual based debate and look at it and, therefore, we would have
a possibility of coming together.  So that's what I mean when I say
it's political and I'm not surprised that eventually, another issue,
affirmative action, hits the political screen and becomes the focal
point for debate.
<p>
Sure, there are lots of other places--you could talk about criminal
justice.  Why do we have a criminal system where if you are a user of
crack, you get a mandatory sentence of X number of years, but if you
are a user of cocaine or heroin, it's a totally different sentence,
especially when you know what crack is, a synthetic for poor people?
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Do you agree on this particular issue, by the way?
<p>
CONNERLY:  No, I don't.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  On the crack cocaine?
<p>
CONNERLY:  No.  let me just focus on process again, because,
again, we could be here a long time debating affirmative action or, as
I see in many cases, affirmative action programs that are, indeed
preferential.  The reason that this issue came to the surface and is
out there now, front and center, for the American people is because as
we now admit, Dick Atkinson and all of the chancellors will admit,
yes, we are giving preferences, because that is the only way that we
could achieve the diversity that we thought was so compelling.  Yes,
we are treating students differently.  And even the most die-hard
supporters of affirmative action, the San Francisco Chronicle no
longer tries to argue that we have ended affirmative action; they
argue we have ended preferences.
<p>
Now when people realize that we are, indeed, treating their students
differently, their sons and daughters differently, when they realize
that there are certain people who are not being allowed to bid on
contracts because of their gender or their race or ethnic
background, when they find that certain jobs, like at the University
of California, were being advertised, `The affirmative action goal of
this position is,' and you fill in the blank, those things give rise
to people addressing the issue of affirmative action.  So I would
argue that it is the practices and the perception of the
practices and whether they are right or wrong that left us with no
choice in California but to deal with them.
<p>
Here is the problem that we have in discussing an issue like this.
There are some who look at the past and who say, `We have to address
the past.' There are some of us who look at public policy as a matter
of, `What do we want?  What values do we want our public policies to
represent?' And public policy for us is not so much addressing the
past, but how do we set a framework for guiding governmental and, in
some cases, private conduct within those public policies?  And the two
sides never come together because one is looking at it through the
rearview mirror; the other is looking at it through the windshield and
saying, `Public policy to me is supposed to articulate what we
aspire to.' Bill is saying--and I respect that--`I'm looking at the
past,' he is saying.  `We've got this discrimination we still have to
address.' I'm saying, `Yeah, I know we've got the discrimination, but
I want public policies that take us to where we want to go,' and we
never quite seem to come to terms on what public policy is supposed to
be, prospective or retro...
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Can I ask you, are you in favor of laws
banning discrimination in the private sector?
<p>
CONNERLY:  Where the private sector is involved, in public
accommodations, for example, yes, I am.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Like restaurants and...
<p>
CONNERLY:  Yes, absolutely.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  ...what about regular employers?
<p>
CONNERLY:  Not--I won't say across the board regular employers.
No, I would not.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Why not?
<p>
CONNERLY:  Well, if an employer is a Chinese restaurant, for
example, and they have five employees and they want to maintain that
Chinese restaurant authenticity and they're not getting any government
money and their bottom line is on the line, I'm not
in favor of government saying, `You have to hire people of a certain
background,' if it's private.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  OK.  The floor is open.
<p>
GRAY:  Could I--I just have got to respond to something, because
this is what I mean by where we get off on the discussion of race.  To
suggest that I am looking at it through a rearview mirror is ludicrous
and it's really pretty insulting.  I am a history major.  I think I'm
the only one in this room who has served in public policy and made the
laws of this land--chairman of the budget committee, chairman of the
Democratic Caucus, majority whip.  I made law for 12 years.  Laws are
made in this country to reflect several things.  One, correct problems
of the past.  Shape where we want to go.  This debate is not about the
past.  In fact, if you--I would argue that affirmative action, or
redress of segregation and slavery in this country, is not about
compensatory action.  It really is about our national interest in the
21st century.
<p>
And let me explain that, and especially in education, more so than in
the private sector.  Why?  Because if you look at the demographics of
this country and what demographers are saying will happen to us, in 21
1/2 years, one-third of this country will be made up of
African-Americans and Latinos.  By 2029, the number-one minority group
in America's gonna be Latinos.  By 2050, which is not that long,
one-half of this nation will be made up of the people we call
minorities.  You combine that with the increasing number of women in
the labor force, you're talking about what's the best policy to make
America strong in the 21st century so that we can compete in the
global marketplace?  And it seems to me that you ought to learn from
the past, and that's why you ought to look at the past.
<p>
But, really, what this debate is about, especially if you talk about
higher education--it's about the future.  Who's gonna be the doctors?
Who's gonna be the research scientists?  Who's gonna be the business
managers?  And if you restrict the doorway of empowerment, which is
education, then you're gonna have an America, folks, who are not gonna
be pre-eminent or competitive in the global marketplace of the 21st
century.
<p>
So I'm not arguing from the past.  I'm not even arguing from
compensatory issues of the past.  I'm just saying it makes good sense
in my mind to figure a way to make sure that women and minorities are
not excluded based upon a false criteria.  And thus, when you debate
the issue of criteria and merit, what determines that?  Will it be an
SAT and GPA alone?  Will those be the only factors?  I'll even drop
the issue of other preferences, such as alumni preferences, athletic
preferences, where if you got a 2.5 and an 850 on the SATs, you can go
to UCLA, but if you got 1100 and a 3.6, you can't today.  But the
issue in my mind is not the past.  The issue is, how do we get to the
society that I agree with him on?  I think the way you get to that
society is empowering people with the most empowering tool that we
know in American society.  That's education.  And I can only give you
one example of when we did it before and we overcame ethnicity, and we
had a lot of ethnicity barriers back then.  It was called the GI Bill
after World War II when we took eight million folks who fought in the
war and gave 'em a preference.  It said, `If you go to Penn--if you go
to Penn State, if you go to Stanford, we'll pay the bill.  If you want
to go to med school, we'll pay the bill.' That revolutionized this
country and led to the great industrial wealth and our world dominance
in the second half of the 20th century.  It just seems to me that the
way to get to where he wants to go and where I want to go, it seems,
to empower more people.  And anything that constricts that door in my
opinion is not good public policy.
<p>
CONNERLY:  You know, I really thought we were going to talk
about process here and not debate preferences or affirmative action.
I think that my reticence here to betray what I thought were the
rules is putting the whole issue at a disadvantage, but I
just hope that we talk about process.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Let's stipulate that the questions and the
answers from now on will be about process.
<p>
Jean Elshtain is the first.
<p>
JEAN BETHKE ELSHTAIN:  Yes.  This is, I think, a question about
process, and it's based on a comment that Mr. Gray made that concerns
me just a bit, because it seems--which I thought was a bit ironic,
coming from someone who served in Congress--seems to express a very
low view of politics.  That is, Mr. Gray, you said that this has
turned into a political discussion that is based neither in fact nor
in reality but rather in emotion, as if the realm of politics is a
realm of completely out of control emotion, and then we have some
other realm where we deal with facts and we deal with reality.  But,
surely, the issues that we're talking about are essentially political
issues that concern us as citizens--concern who we are as people.  And
the issue is, how do we, in and through the political process--the
political process, engage these questions?  And it seems to me one
can't even begin to address that issue if you put politics over in a
realm of kind of irrationalism, and then there's this other realm
where, somehow, we're going to get to facts and reality.  So I wonder
if you would comment on that, and I would like to get Mr. Connerly
to...
<p>
GRAY:  First of all, if I gave you the impression
that 12 years of my life was spent irrationally, I'm wrong.  I
didn't mean to do that.  I don't think my 12 years in Congress was an
irrational exercise, and I did not, I think, say that.  What I said...
<p>
ELSHTAIN:  No, you said, `Politics was based neither in fact nor
in reality but in emotion.'
<p>
GRAY:  Yeah.  I--what I think I said to you is that the entire of
issue of race in this country has its roots in American politics.  Go
back, I used the Constitution, I used the Civil War and that whole
structure.  Secondly, therefore, the debate has been centered
primarily in political action.  [Proposition] 209, in answer to the
question
of how do we get to focus on affirmative action only, was a political
debate in one state.  It's been debated in a bunch of other states,
13, and it hasn't gone anywhere.  It was debated two weeks ago in
Congress, the Riggs amendment, and got defeated pretty soundly.
<p>
My point was that where does this debate posit itself in American
politics?  That's not an irrational process, unless you consider
democracy as sometimes being irrational, and as one who served in the
Congress, sometimes the making of sausage is not pleasant to look at.
But it works.  It's the best governing system that I know, and that
debate usually brings to it a long-term process where you come out at
the end.  And is there irrationality in it?  Yes.  Is there fear in
it?  Is there playing to the fears of people in it?  Yes.  However,
that doesn't mean that the process is totally irrational, and I don't
mean to say that.  I'm just simply saying that race is a political
issue in America; always has been.  Two, that's why we see it in an
issue like affirmative action and a process issue.  Thirdly, what I'm
simply saying to you about the public-policy arena is that,
ultimately, that's where we will resolve it.  I don't think it's gonna
be resolved anywhere else, and we're still struggling with it as a
nation.
<p>
I mean, you--I'm not alarmed at that, because I'm pretty optimistic
about the future because process means, to me, we're only 25
years--maybe 28 years--from the period when I couldn't vote in
certain states.  We've made tremendous progress.  I mean--and we sit
around here--I hate to--well, I won't use a name, but I can think
of--let me just make this point.  We have universities that today have
13 percent, 14 percent total minority enrollment of all minorities,
which 15 years ago had less than 3 percent, OK?  I think we've made
progress, and that debate has moved us forward.  And, you know, we've
sometimes changed the consensus.  So, please, I don't mean that
politics is irrational.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  We have a long list of people here, so could we
keep...
<p>
ELSHTAIN:  Could Mr. Connerly just very briefly
comment on the notion of politics as the process wherein we deal
with these issues?
<p>
CONNERLY:  Politics is the art of making public policy, and
sometimes it's flawed and sometimes it's at its best, and I
don't--when someone say this is political, that is, by definition, the
art of setting public policy.  I don't think it's irrational.  I think
it's sometimes corrupted by money and a lot of other
things, but I don't view the fact that people debate and
agonize and throw their emotions into the process as being bad,
necessarily.
<p>
Some of us look at the whole issue of affirmative action as a policy;
for other people, it's personal.  And that, too, is part of the political
process.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  OK.  Larry Lessig.
<p>
LAWRENCE LESSIG:  Mr. Connerly, one strategy used to debate
this topic is to say that the harm caused by excluding somebody
because he or she is black is the same as the harm caused by excluding
somebody because he or she is white.  Do you agree with that
assessment of the harm, and do you think it's a useful way to talk
about the cost of affirmative action?
<p>
CONNERLY:  Absolutely, I agree with it.  I think that the
reason why we're into this bind right now is because we have not
agreed with that premise.  We have said that if you treat a black
student, a Latino or Chicano--and they're different in our definition
at the university--or Native American differently, if you take and
give points to a white or an Asian student, that's
discrimination.  But if we treat a white or an Asian differently, we
say that's just building diversity.  And in my mind, they are the
same.  The harm is the same, whether the student is black or
white or whatever.  When we treat them differently, the harm, it seems
to me, is the same.  Regardless of the past, regardless of anything
else, the harm is the same.
<p>
LESSIG:  Do you think it's experienced the same?
<p>
CONNERLY:  I think it's experienced the same.  I think that if
you are a low-income Asian student or a low-income white student who
has applied to the University of California from a low-income
background, coming from a single-parent household, it doesn't matter
how someone rationalizes it.  You have been harmed.  And in my view,
it may not have the stigma of race that it would carry if the
person were black, but you've been harmed.
<p>
LESSIG:  So you agree there's a difference, then, is just
the stigma of race.
<p>
CONNERLY:  I think it's very subtle.  I think it's very subtle.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Derek Bok.
<p>
DEREK BOK:  I have an issue of process I'd like to put to both of
you that we haven't really touched on, and--which is
remarkably--I think it's very difficult, but not really talked about
very much in this debate, and that is, who ought to be making this
kind of a decision?  And the reason why I think it's difficult is
because the elements that are profoundly educational, on which I'm not
sure the public is particularly competent through a referendum
to judge, but on the other hand the whole question of who gets
into select institutions also has public consequences.  But
there are many people who could make this.  The Supreme Court
could make this judgment.  Interestingly enough, the Supreme Court, in
Bakke and also in the Sweezy case, was rather reluctant to interpose
its judgment on an educational issue for educators.  But obviously,
there are contrary reasons.  Or the public could make it, as you
decided to do in California, by making it a referendum issue.
<p>
So I'm just interested; how would you ideally, since you
see the interests of the University of California, you see the public
interest; how would you reconcile that?  Is this something, really,
where ultimately we ought to have referenda?  Is it something where
universities ought to be given the decisive word?  Or is there some
third alternative by which we could somehow combine in some better way
the respective interests of public and educational issues involved?
<p>
CONNERLY:  Excellent question.  When we--when I brought this up
as a regent at the university, there were those who said, `We should
leave this to the faculty, because they're the ones who really know
what the admissions criteria ought to be,' and that there was great
value in diversity and therefore the faculty should make this
decision.  I saw that as a matter of citizenship.  When we're saying
to one student, `You're going to be treated differently on the basis
of skin color or race or ethnicity,' that is a matter of citizenship.
It's a matter of the rights of those students which we should not be
able to abridge and leave the faculty to make that decision.  And so I
felt that it was totally appropriate, even though there were some who
said we were violating shared governance.
<p>
It's totally appropriate for us to say, `No, we're going to respect
our interpretation of the Constitution and the rights that flow from
the Constitution to the individual.' And ultimately, I guess, the
Supreme Court has to reaffirm whether or not we're right.  And when we
found that students were, in fact, being treated differently and we
had a whole range of programs that were treating people differently in
California, and the Legislature would not respond because of identity
politics and everything else, then the people of California grabbed
their pitchforks and said, `No, this is something that relates to
citizenship--the rights of every citizen in the state of California.'
<p>
So ultimately, I see it as a matter of political values,
a matter of citizenship.  And therefore, the people or the
Constitution should be where that decision is made.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Joyce Appleby.
<p>
JOYCE APPLEBY:  Well, I approach this question as a faculty
member at UCLA, and so I'm very interested in the students.  I'm
interested in next year's students.  And one very interesting fact,
I think, about the change from '97 to '98 that hasn't been brought
out, and that there were 219 African-American students who
were admitted in '97, and enrolled, and there'll be
131 in 1998.  Now, there's a similar
change in all those categories.  But that indicates that, I mean,
those students who come in '98, those African-American students, will
know that they got in on competitive criteria.  I mean, there must be
a great deal of pride that will--that they will feel in knowing that
they earned their place, and I think the other students on campus will
look at them differently.  They'll say, `They competed alongside us,
and they made it.'
<p>
So that, to me--talk about just the political process--I see that
as a gain.  I also think that, when you look at that figure of 60
percent, it means that all previous incoming classes of
African-American students or Hispanic students--60 percent of them
made it competitively, we would assume.  But they were covered in, you
know--we didn't know that until we could make this comparison.
<p>
And so as I say, I think that's a real gain.  However, when I
then try to take that social fact that's now been revealed and apply
it to the goal of achieving a color-blind society, which we've all
agreed is our shared goal, I see one very
important means to that end is to identify and bring in as many
eligible--and they were always eligible--underrepresented minority
students as possible, to bring them into college and to get them
through college and to have them, by developing their potential, make
the society--encourage the society to drop color discrimination and
to achieve a color-blind society.
<p>
So I still would think that it would be important to go back to when
we had more underrepresented minority students.  So this takes me back
to the admissions process.  You want to talk about process.  The
admissions process is a very interesting and imprecise process, and
I'm talking about it now as it exists, because I think this question
about preferences--if you just focus upon race, is neglecting the fact
that there are all kinds of preferences right now in the admissions
process.
<p>
Something like 60 percent of the students who apply to the University
of California are admitted on straight, objective criteria, you might
call it--SATs and GPA.  The other 40 percent--there are discriminatory
factors that are introduced to achieve a variety of goals.  One of the
goals is to get students who have shown that they have incredible
musical talent; you have athletic ability.  There are, though we don't
like to admit it, people who get in because--and are given preferences
because they are donors' children or legislators' children.
<p>
So my question is, why, when we use a mix of criteria to get that
other 40 percent, would we want to eliminate race when we live in a
society in which race matters and class matters and family matters and
talent matters?  And this admissions system is taking all of that into
account to achieve a rather complex end in the intake of its
students.  And I say that particularly when we don't really have a lot
of conclusive evidence about how to achieve this color-blind society.
So why would we want to eliminate something that has been so
productive, which is to find and encourage and admit into our
institutions of higher learning underrepresented minorities when we
are, you know, interested in finding special talent, when we're
interested in working against the disadvantages of class or the
disadvantages of location?  And I guess that was a question I would
put to you, Mr. Connerly, since we had this mix of preferences,
why take this one out?
<p>
CONNERLY:  Because race is special in America.  As Bill said, we
fought a civil war about it.  It's something over which many of
us--all of us--have no control.  And to accord race the same status as
the son of an athlete or as an athlete or the son of alumni or
whatever, it seems to me, is missing the whole point of American
history.  Race is important.  Race is something that the
courts have said is inherently suspect, because
when you start making decisions about people's lives on the basis of
race, that can inevitably lead to stereotyping.  It can lead to all
kinds of things that we have decided we really don't want to do.
<p>
It is a political value.  You may believe that it's OK to use it, but
I think that the majority of us have concluded, certainly in
my state, we don't want to use that.  We don't want to make decisions
about people on the basis of their race or whatever
that is, by the way.  We don't even know what it is.  We have so much
interracial marriages and people that are coming from
different backgrounds.  We're creating new species every day.  We
don't even know what race is.
<p>
And so we have made the political judgment that there are certain kind
of preferences that we think are special, that are harmful, and
judging somebody on the basis of their skin color or whatever we call
race or ethnic background or national origin or where your father or
mother happen to have been born is just as a political judgment,
a value judgment, is something that we've decided is off limits.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Richard Daynard.
<p>
RICHARD DAYNARD:  Thanks.  I want to talk about the possibility
of having a conversation about this issue.  I think what's happened is
this has and I think we can learn from this.  The question is,
what is the learning from this?  That an attempt to have a
conversation about the issue, a conversation being--I would define, I
think, as something where we're attempting to learn from each other
and see if there is either common ground or some ground not yet
discovered that both parties--people or both sides can reach for.
That, in fact, has, in some sense, lost out in this discussion
we've had thus far to a statement of positions--you know, all powerful
positions, all with powerful responses, but all of which we're quite
familiar with.
<p>
I thought I saw a possibility for hope in that both Mr. Connerly
and Mr. Gray said that what they wanted in the end eschatologically
is the same thing, which is society in which race doesn't matter, and
that they're both pragmatists.  They're both people who are trying to
figure out how you get from here to there.  They may disagree about
how you describe the `here' and what the best ways are from--getting
from here to there, but that those are things that we ought to be
talking about.
<p>
So that gave me hope that we could have a conversation, but then what
has taken away the hope, or made me question whether
there is such hope, is the question--are there just such
different first principles about what's really, ultimately important
that you two gentlemen represent and that, I think, questions from the
floor also represent, that in the end it's simply going to be a
question of who wins, if not this generation, then next
generation, next generation, the one after that, but that it's really
not something that, even though there did seem to be things you could
discuss--that's not something that really can be much discussed, that
can simply be stated:  `This is who I am, this is where I come from,
this is what I consider most basic,' and that's it?
<p>
So, you know, I'd like to ask, you know, beginning with Mr. Connerly
and then Mr. Gray:  Is there a possibility, a realistic possibility,
of conversation here?  Or is it simply a question of, you know, who's
going to be most persuasive with their existing point of view in the
political process?
<p>
CONNERLY:  I think that there's a possibility that we
indeed can discuss it rationally, even emotionally--there's nothing
wrong with passion--as long as we keep our eye on the fact that
we're trying to arrive at some consensus on
first values, on a national aspiration.  We knew in the '60s that our
goal was to rid the nation of prejudice and discrimination.  We
thought we wanted integration.  I'm not so sure now that that is,
indeed, the goal that we have.  I believe in it with every fiber of my
being, but there are those who don't seem to embrace that.
<p>
Now if we just put on the table the question of do we really want--not
to force it, but do we really want an integrated society?  Do we want
this one nation without divisible parts?  Do we want a society in
which race has no place in American life or law, in which our
government agencies do not take that into account?  If that's what we
want, then how do we devise a road map to get there?  But that is a
first value.  That is a fundamental question that we have to ask
ourselves.  And if we can agree that that is, indeed a
fundamental question, and then we can debate whether--how we come down
on that question, then the question is, how long do we think it
should take us to get there?  What are the different things that we
have to do in order to rid ourselves of it?  Is it acceptable to
use race, because it matters now, until we can get to the point where
it no longer matters?  And how do we install milestones to
get us there?
<p>
But I'm hopeful.  I think we can do that.
<p>
GRAY:  The issue, as I said before, is the issue of what are the
strategies to get you there, based on what your viewpoint is of where
we are?  And I'm not sure in America there's agreement on where we
are.  Maybe here; there's a very talented, educated group.  But I
spend my life, ladies and gentlemen, not so much with groups like
this, but with a lot of poor people in inner-city
neighborhoods--black, Latino--and I spend a lot of time with whites
who are poor as well, and working class.  And the fundamental question
of is the playing field level--I'm not sure that there's agreement in
America on that.
<p>
Then, secondly, the question then becomes--you've got to reach
agreement on that; then you've got to decide what the strategies are
to get you to that color-blind society that Martin Luther King dreamed
about.  And the problem is, we like the dream, but are we willing to
take the difficult steps to get there and implement the policies that
will get us there quickly?  Or are we prepared to wait generations and
let evolution take its place, you know, and maybe work or not work,
and pay the terrible price for that?
<p>
I believe that it is in our interest in the debate to ask those
questions.  Obviously, Ward and I have a difference on what is the
strategy to get you there, a very fundamental difference, OK?  And I
don't want to argue the issue again and get whispered, you know,
`process,' all right?  But the point is, going back to the lady over
here to my left whose name I can't see--Ms. Appleby--and she and I
both know, because I've been in higher education for 30 years--you may
know me as a congressman, but no, that's what my field was--we all
know that there's preferences.
<p>
If you go--the question we've got to ask is, what is gonna be the
criteria to determine who gets those seats at UCLA, at Harvard, at
Penn, Penn State or wherever?  Those are the doorways to opportunity.
And if you use certain criteria, you're going to lock out certain
people who have been locked out because of historical circumstance,
not necessarily because of ability.  All I'm simply saying is that in
the debate, if you're going to hold a position on one place of a
preference, to me it seems terribly inconsistent not to hold it
throughout.
<p>
In fact, in the state of Texas, they came up with a very interesting
solution down in Texas.  Ward, I don't know if you know about it.
When they had the debate of 209 down there and they tried to pass it,
some of the legislators got together and said, `Let's attach an
amendment and do away with all forms of preferences in
admission--alumni, athletic, special talent.' Then a friend of mine
who's a state senator called me and said, `Bill, guess who was
standing outside the door urging people which way to vote on it?  It
was the head of the state university system of Texas.' Why?  Because
they realized that if it passed, football would be gone.
<p>
And so what came was the compromise, which the governor supported,
Brother Bush--not a liberal--that said, `We'll take 10--the top 10
from every high school, and that's the way we'll do it.' That's an
interesting solution.  I don't know whether it's gonna work or not,
but it means that if you got a black high school, the top 10 are
probably gonna be black; a Latino high school, they're gonna be, you
know, white, because of our neighborhood segregation pattern.  But
that was an interesting solution, I thought.  Maybe that's the way we
ought to go.  I don't know.
<p>
But, ladies and gentlemen, I think what I'm saying, Richard, is
that--how do you view America at this point?  Two, what is the
strategy you think will get us to where Ward and I would both like?
I don't think elimination of affirmative opportunity, as Julius called
it, or affirmative action or preference to help push women and
minorities through the doorway is going to help get us to that point.
<p>
DAYNARD:  I think I hear the possibility of a conversation.
<p>
GRAY:  And I'm sorry; I said--he just said `process.' So, I mean,
you know--so again, process is where do you see it?  And that's the
problem with the whole debate.  That's the problem with the whole
debate.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  We have a fairly long list.  Martin Seligman.
<p>
MARTIN E. P. SELIGMAN:  Well, Richard, I saw quite a bit of hope of
conversation here, and it was because of the agreement of the dream,
the end being a color-blind society, and if that's the shared
end, then a very relevant question is, have we moved toward this or
away from it in the last 28 years?  So I want to ask, in some ways, in
the last 28 years, is there more or less segregation, if you
will, racial tension, harmony, racial hatred?  How has this changed?
And if it's gotten worse, does that tell us we're on the wrong track?
If it's gotten better, does that tell us we're on the right track?
<p>
CONNERLY:  I don't think there's any one answer to that.  I think
that the differences are regional, in some cases.  I think that there
are, in certain, quote, "groups"--I find the level of alienation among
middle-class black people as high as it's ever been, from my
perspective, and that is a group that--among others, that probably
benefits substantially from preferences.  I don't understand that.
I find in many cases, like at the University of California--we have
separate graduation ceremonies based on race.  Now that does not take
us to the goal of a unified, color-blind society.  We're going to have
on the agenda at the June meeting whether that complies with
Proposition 209.  And the general counsel has said, `No, it does not.'
But we're still trying to find a way, through the back door, to do
that.  Call it--let's call it celebration, rather than ceremony, as
some of us say, and maybe it'll get around it.
<p>
But I don't think there's an answer to it one way or another, but I
find that in many cases we are headed the wrong way, and I think it's
these kind of policies, personally, that take us down that path.
You get to be what you practice, and if you want to be a
color-blind society, it seems to me you put in place policies that
allow you to strive toward that.  If you embrace the notion that race
matters and you're going to use race to get beyond race, guess what?
You'll never get beyond it.  That's my perspective.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Jim Fishkin next.
<p>
JAMES FISHKIN:  This conversation fills me with both hope and
despair simultaneously; hope because it's a very rich dialogue and I
see, to my surprise, agreement on eschatology, fundamental goals,
values.  And public-policy issues where there's no prospect of that
kind of agreement--I think probably, in some cases, abortion would be
a case where you wouldn't get that--here this is very different.
There is, if the two of you distinguished gentlemen are
representative of the sides of the debate, there is actually agreement
on the most fundamental values, and it's a question of fact.  There
are a series of facts and strategies and trade-offs which, in an ideal
public-policy discourse, those trade-offs would get fully aired; the
arguments would get responded to with counterarguments; the differing
constructions of the facts about where we are now and the differing
constructions of fact about where we might go, what might count as
appropriate criteria for merit now and in the future, and the effects
of different policy proposals would get a full airing.
<p>
Now if those questions of fact, broadly construed, value-laden facts,
in many cases, contested facts--if those were aired enough, I could
see, actually, some policy consensus--very useful--developing
eventually.  However, it really is quite remarkable,
and I hadn't seen that before.
<p>
Now the despair comes from the fact that probably, in
referendum politics, sound-bite-driven television advertising, you're
not gonna get anything like even the kind of rich dialogue we had here
aired to the broad public.  You might get it among certain elites, but
you're not gonna get it among the broad public.  So part of the
problem is--and, indeed, the agenda of this Commission--is how, on
such important matters, do we get a serious, balanced public-policy
dialogue, of which this conversation is a good initial start?  It's a
good specimen of--but the despair--I don't know what's gonna happen in
your state, because you are left with the legacy of the dark
legacy of the progressive idealism of referendum politics with
television advertising thrown in.  So...
<p>
CONNERLY:  Well, don't despair about my state, because I
think that we are very slowly coming to terms with this issue in a
very positive way.  We have never had as much attention focused on K
through 12 as we have right now.  There is a genuine belief that a
gun is to our head to make sure that we turn out kids who are
competitively admissible.  So the process produces solutions, because
people feel that they're left with no choice.
<p>
The next thing I think we're going to address is what's going on in
the family?  Why aren't more kids who happen to be black or Latino
graduating from high school?  We had in 1996 just 544 kids who
graduated, who happened to be black, from high school in California
who were UC-eligible--not in the county of Los Angeles, by the
way--throughout the state of California, 544 out of 18,000.  That is
the problem.  Now at some point, as we start addressing K through 12,
we start asking something that it's been difficult for us to
ask right now:  What's happening in the community?  What's happening
in the families?
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  Those are all good questions.  Yeah.
<p>
GRAY:  I don't want to get into a debate, and I'm gonna stay away
from it.  Jim, I'm not sure I agree with your statement, and maybe I
haven't made myself--I think you heard what I said.  We don't have an
honest look at facts.  We develop myths about our positions and they
get caught up in sound bites.  I agree with you.  And you are
absolutely right.  Why don't we have the facts on the table, such as
the whole debate about blacks vs.  Asians, which always gets held up
and say--you know, it somehow implies that blacks and
Latinos--something [is] wrong with them, but something's right with
Asians.
<p>
Well, you know, if any of you will talk to Nancy Cole and look at the
ETS profiles, you will find that the Asians who take the SAT tests are
from a significantly higher income group of both the blacks and the
Latino, and Nancy Cole will tell you that the greatest correlation
between test-taking is income.  And so thus, if they are a minority,
but if those who take the SAT fit a profile similar to whites as
opposed to blacks or Latinos, they will score significantly different.
That's a fact.  So therefore, we will stop this nonsense of comparing
blacks, Latinos, to Asians, which implies something is genetically
wrong with black folk.  That's what I mean by facts.
<p>
I agree that--going back to Martin, since no one asked me my opinion
of your question--I'm gonna give it to you anyway, whether you like it
or not.  I think we have made some progress.  The fact that I can get
elected chairman of the Budget Committee, a liberal from Philadelphia,
in 1984 after Reagan wiped the Democrats off the map, and won against
Southerner--a Southern candidate and got more Southern votes.  Yeah.
I mean, I think that is a sign of progress.  When I see a Colin
Powell, that's a sign of progress.  And I could cite you all the
signs of progress.
<p>
So I think we have made progress at many levels.  However--and I cited
the ones about faculty at universities, and I know the faculties at
universities and what they were like in 1970 and what they are today.
We've made progress.  However, I would say that progress has not been
deep enough, strong enough, and we still have a very, very long way to
go, all right?  And from my point of view, to look at a Bill Gray or
Colin Powell or Ken Chenault at American Express and say, `Oh, we're
there,' or look at a few women in corporate America or Ginsburg and
Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court and say, `Oh, women don't
have a problem'--I don't think anybody would agree with that.  I still
think we have some very significant and deep problems.
<p>
I also don't think that some people in America would agree with what
you said and what I said about the assessment of where we want to be.
I do believe that there are some Americans who don't believe blacks
and whites ought to sit at the table--and they're not all white, by
the way, OK?--and don't think that that dream is possible.  They
don't.  And I think they're in both communities.  They're what I call
the pessimists--don't see the progress, or think the progress is only
individual or very small, and don't think America, in light of its
history, has the capacity to face the race question and deal with it
in a strong way so that you can create that possibility.  And so we
end up lurching, having these debates every 10 years or so about race,
over an issue, and then we go back to sleep again and hope everything
will lie down and be quiet.
<p>
And there is hostility.  I would agree with Ward where he says there's
hostility in the black community.  We don't want to talk about that.
We don't want to talk about what happens to the black stockbroker who
makes $2 million a year every day of his life in New York
City--insults that he knows are occurring because he's black.
We want to think that somehow, because he's a stockbroker making $2
million, he's made it.  He goes home as angry as the janitor, and we
don't want to debate that and look at those facts.
<p>
So my viewpoint is that, yes, we've made it.  I think you've put your
finger on it.  Bill, is there debate about fact?  We don't debate
fact.  And in a sound-bite political arena, whew!  You get a key word,
a word, and that becomes the turning point.  And you get the spin
doctors theand the rest of them, and that just skewers the
debate.
<p>
SUNSTEIN:  We do have consensus, I've discerned, on a variety of
principles.  One is that we have to end now.  One is that it's very
important not to attack the good faith of one's opponents.  One is
that factual issues are important, but occasionally not decisive to
resolution of policy issues.  One is that affirmative action is only
one of a range of racial issues, and it's unfortunate that it's
received so much attention.  One is that it's extremely difficult to
argue from first principles.  One is that when first principles are
shared, it is possible to mediate strategic questions for factual
questions.  That's a sign of hope.  And the last, in a way the most
interesting, I think, is the great difficulty of extracting the issues
of substance from the issues of process.  There's a real
lesson in that.  I'm not sure exactly what it is.
<p>
I'd like to thank Mr. Gray and Mr. Connerly for an excellent
discussion, for great civility amidst disagreement.
