RICHARD RODRIGUEZ:  This is the part of the meeting that's more
interesting to me than to you because I can find out how much of this
makes any sense to you.  I'm willing to entertain any
observations, objections, questions, insights.  I will steal your
ideas, I promise you.
<p>
MARTIN MARTY:  Pardon?
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  I will steal your ideas.
<p>
MARTY:  OK.  By the way, I do have a Mexican granddaughter, so I'm
beginning to be in the club.  First of all, I you
parachuted into a group that is talking exactly about what you're
giving us, or at least you're putting on our agenda.  I feel very
much at home with that new agenda.  Three times you used the
word `meaning':  once `the meaning of America'; once your waiter this
morning `will change the meaning of Philadelphia'; and `what does
California mean?' And I'm wondering whether you think there is such a
thing as a search for the meaning of the larger culture,
whatever it is.  Should we seek it?  What do--begin to look like?  Is
it a will-o'-the-wisp?  Is it a dream?  What do you have in mind when
you--or are you being ironic?
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Well, I was partly being ironic.  I was
being insofar as I'm American, I'm ironic.  I don't
think that the American inclines to `the meaning.' And that's why I
think we've always romanticized the immigrant as precisely
sort of challenging 'the meaning.'  There is -- I take it that
there is in this country right now a kind of fatigue that is beginning
to develop and a sense in which we have to find 'the meaning'.  We
cannot go living this life indefinitely.  We may not need those people
redefining us, on the one hand.  On the other hand, we are
tired of it.  We see this kind of confusion in our own
children and we yearn for a meaning.
<p>
But I use the term ironically and I see it as an
impossible quest.  I think one of the things I love so much about
this country is precisely its wildness.  I just find this country to
be astonishing in its adolescence, that it just seems not to
settle down.  And every time you think you have it, it just sort
of goes away and does something else.  In that way, I've always
thought that I don't speak English so much as I speak American, that
this country, this language that we speak--the British have
always said that, of course, that we don't speak English--but that
the language that we speak is so much I mean, the world
language--the American tongue--the reason it's the world
language, because it's always been without fear of the world.  It's
always sort of absorbed the world.  It has been willing to change and
to steal the languages of the world.  And I love that
language very much.  I'm very much afraid, as we begin now to speak of
the US English movement, mandating that English be spoken here, and I
think to myself, well, `What is English?' You know, is the word
`sauna'--is that English, you know?  I mean, is this kind of the
Academie Francaise, where we sort of decide what is and what isn't?
<p>
The intensity with which the pioneers in the 19th century
were willing to steal Spanish and make it English--mosquito,
mesa--and make those Spanish words our language.  That was
the very arrogance that allowed for the creation of a world
tongue.  When we stop that, when we settle the tongue, when we settle
the culture, we become, friends, it seems to me.  We become something
much less.  And there are people in this country, I think,
who really want to settle it.  And I hope this Commission is not part
of that process.
<p>
Yes. <p>

ROBERT WIEBE:  I take your bumper sticker `Assimilation
happens' to be, in a sense, the theme of your talk.  Things happen.
People want things, but in your scheme, that want becomes ironic,
foolish, ineffectual.  Because things happen.  I wonder, is
that the message you think would best serve this commission, to sense
that when a person or groups of people in the United States choose to
identify themselves in what would additively become a multicultural
society, they're fatuous, they're against the current, that
assimilation happens?  They can't do that.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Uh-huh.
<p>
WIEBE:  Is...
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Yes, I do think...
<p>
WIEBE:  Am I in tune with what you're trying to tell us?  I'm a
little disturbed, for us, I guess.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Well, don't be.  I mean, I don't distinguish in my...
<p>
WIEBE:  Or we would need to then look for the happenings and not
paying much attention to what people...
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Well, I asked one
of the Commission members this morning whether there is an intent in
future meetings to meet gang members, to meet high school
teachers, to meet policemen, to meet missionaries from Mormon
churches and so forth.  I'd like to see between what I call the
level of physics and the level of biology.  I mean, the
President's about to convene this meeting on race relations, and
I think it's going to be very much
physics, where Americans talk about what race is and race relations
and these huge terms as though there is this thing called
black America or this thing that's called white America and so forth.
<p>
At the level of biology, of course, we're listening to each other's
music, we're falling in love, we hate each other, we're
fighting, we're so engaged by each other that we
can we almost can't--are obsessed by each other.  I mean, the
level of biology--I keep thinking--you know, I'm working
right now on the Jehovah's Witness, which I find--I'm
studying the Jehovah's Witness.  I've always been interested in that
church, but it's really--you know, economically and culturally at the
very bottom, and yet it is probably--the congregations that I have met
are the most integrated of any society's I know of in the
United States.  And it is so easily integrated that you wonder, well,
why do you do it and why cannot Harvard do it?  You
know, what's Harvard's problem?  Why does USA Today report that
college-educated blacks are so pessimistic when at this level America
is so intensely at each other's face, you know?
<p>
I would just say to anybody who has to live in the world of physics,
which is where you and I exist, that we be attentive to the world
of biology and that we realize that there is something going on, a
knowledge below that is going to revolutionize the top and it works
that way.  It does not come down from on high, you know?  And
it makes me nervous sometimes to even talk this way because already
to suggest that I see the world from on high is to
misidentify where I'm seeing the energies.  They're
coming from down bottom.
<p>
WIEBE:  But I hear you say that is things like energies and
flow and happenings.  I'm delighted to hear that change is coming from
the bottom and not the top.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Yeah.
<p>
WIEBE:  I'm not delighted to think that those changes seem to lie
beyond the capacities of any groups to make choices about change which
would have a significant effect on change.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Well, I think you can--for example, I think that--let
me use the issue of illegal immigration.  I think that part of what
I'm urging is that it seems to me that there's a movement in
the world right now that we cannot completely control.  I think we can
talk about improving of the way the border is policed.
We can talk about certainly making the Border Patrol a much more
efficient, a much more professional police force.  But finally I'm
arguing that there is something that this American notion
that we sort of can will the future to happen is fallacious, that it
doesn't always work that way.  There are energies that are
beyond our willing.
<p>
It's sort of like--I remember watching this demonstration on--I'm
scattering--but this demonstration for AIDS research at
one of these annual meetings.  I think it was in Toronto.  And
I thought to myself, `What if there isn't a cure for AIDS?' I mean,
where do we get the idea that if Elizabeth Taylor collects
enough money, you know, we can sort of lick it or we can sort of deal
with it?  The thing I love most about America as opposed to my
Mexican father's pessimism was that there was always this will in
America that we can do it.  If we decide to do it, we can get a
computer in every classroom and so forth and so on. <p>

Well, I don't want America to lose that determination, but at the
same time, it seems to me that we have to move with a kind
of willingness to move with the flow and to deal with the flow
at the level at which both we have to respond to
it, but we also have to realize that it's not totally within our
control to manage, and that some patience with the world is required,
it seems to me, and some patience with the future, that
it's not going to be ours to settle.  I don't know how else to say
that.  But I'm very much humbled by the energies of
this society, which I'm very optimistic about, incidentally.  I
think something is being born in this society; it has not
died.
<p>
Yes.
<p>
LAWRENCE LESSIG:  I want to continue with Bob's
question, I think.  And it's really to push you on your refusal
to engage the normative question that was asked to you about
assimilation.  I mean, I agree assimilation happens, but assimilation
happens differently for the Turks in Germany, for the Hungarians in
Romania, for the Serbs and Croats in former Yugoslavia, for the
French [in] Quebec.  It happens differently. <p>

And I completely agree with you that we have no complete control
over it, but that's a separate question from what a normative attitude
should be towards it, right?  I mean, there's a
poetry--a beautiful poetry in what you've given us today, and forgive
me for my lack of sensitivity to the poetry, because I really am
eager to figure out what the normative attitude should be here,
because assimilation can happen very differently because of what we
do.
<p>
And the question, I guess, then is what should we do?  Even if
I completely agree we can't control what's going to happen.
I mean, your speech resonates in a way
that you won't recognize with the morning speech yesterday, a kind of
determinism that we can't do anything about.  I think some of us
want to resist.  I want to know, first, what
should we do and then we'll get to the question of what can we do--but
what we should do here?
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Well, let me answer the second question,
`What can't we do?' I think we cannot legislate people from meeting
each other.  I think we live in a too intensely narrow world
now, where influences can sort of be segregated and kept apart.  I
remember being challenged that, you know, at 2 AM at one of these talk
radio shows and some woman called up and said, you know, `Don't you
care anything at all about these Brazilian Indians, that they're
losing their culture?' And I thought to myself, `Well, you know, if I
were culture minister in Brazil, the first thing I would do is teach
them Brazilian Portuguese, for their survival.'
<p>
I am not going to legislate gringo evangelical missionaries out
of Guatemala.  I think that's
foolish.  I think it achieves nothing.  I think that finally
people are going to meet.  I mean, that's one of the historical
realities of the modern age.
<p>
And once they meet, I would like to argue, and this is where I think
that sometimes the West is a little bit too guilty, with its
sense that it is changing them--once they meet, of course, all bets
are off, as in the case [of] Mexico, for example, you know
--I remember at the Columbus anniversary--the 500th
anniversary--there was all this lament about what the Spaniard had
done to the Indian, and I keep thinking to myself, well, you know, I
go to Mexico and I don't see that many Spaniards around, you know?
<p>
If they had won this, you know, where are they?  And why is it that
all these Indians are speaking Spanish?  How do we understand that?
Do we understand that as simply the triumph of Spain over the
Indian, or do we understand that it's some way as a
triumph of Indian curiosity over the Spanish language.
<p>
But we know that in the United States, at the end of World War I, New
York stole English from London.  Right now Mexico has stolen Spanish
from Madrid and we do not note that sufficiently, it seems to
me--how the colonized become in some way as powerful as the colonizer,
and that in that medium of assimilation the two are changed--or at
least one is in jeopardy in a way that perhaps only Prospero
knew.  I mean, Prospero knew that Caliban was always willing to
swallow whatever Caliban came in touch with, swallowed Miranda,
swallowed Prospero's books--that there was something about the Indian
that was enormously dangerous.
<p>
We know that about Asia.  It annoys us that Asia is as imitative
of us as it is, and that it takes us and somehow redoes us better.
We keep insisting that, no, that isn't the way it should
work.  You know, Asia should come up with its own ideas, its own
technology and so forth.  Well, I think that that imitative
principle may be the more interesting way of talking about what's
going on in the world.  It was a Canadian, after
all, Marshall McCluhan, who said to us that `You know, you
Anglo-Americans who think that you have become the culture of the
world, who think that, with guilt or with pride, who think that just
because the Air India pilot landing in Moscow is speaking English
now; just because the teen-agers of Bombay are dancing to
Michael Jackson; just because the teen-agers of Peru are
drinking Coca-Cola, that you are now masters of the world.' He said,
`At the very moment at which the world is taking your culture, it is
their culture, that you have lost it.  They have swallowed you up.'
<p>
And we don't understand that.  I don't think we have
any idea how American the non-American societies of the world are now,
and how we're almost like this kind of orange that has been
sucked of its juice.  We sit here now worried about the influence we
have on the world when, clearly, the world has already taken our
juice, has moved to some other kind of energy.
<p>
Does that get to something of your worry?
What I worry about in your
question is that somehow this deliberation--even answering that, that
I can decide, you know, that it was not all right for Nunez Cabeza de
Vaca to leave Spain and to enter the Texas panhandle.  He ends up, you
know, he says in his journal, some morning in Texas.  He ends up
in writing in his journal that, `The Indians have come this
morning,' he says, `at the hour that they promised and they have
brought with them certain fish and grains for us to eat.' And Alvar
Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, the great Spanish explorer of the New World,
sits there on his haunches, eating the food that the Indians
have brought.  And then he says, `They have brought their women and
children to look at us.'<p>

But nowhere in his journal does he wonder what the Indians are looking
at, because, of course, he has discovered them.  And what's
interesting to me about Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca is because he
becomes the first major Spanish figure in colonial literature who was
Indianized, who is so radically changed, but by the time he goes back
to Spain, he's a joke.  His face is painted.  He's become
a savage.
<p>
That the notion of assimilation always has to be reciprocal,
that something almost biological is going on there, and that the
conversion of one society by another leaves both sides absolutely
vulnerable in a kind of erotic way to the penetration
of that I want to leave clear, that [it] seems to me that
something is out of control here.  And I'm not sure
how to legislate that relationship with some kind of you know, some
kind of Amherst Law against touching or whatever.
<p>
LESSIG:  You do sound like you're
giving us a way of understanding assimilation that makes it easier to
accept.  It sounds like a normative argument.  You don't want
to call it that, that's fine, but, I mean, now you've 
shown--I mean, it's beautiful, in a sense, the way you've
redescribed it but why do you want to stop by saying--
why don't you want to say it's beautiful?
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Because I'd like saying, rather, that it
I like talking about its aggression.  I like talking
about it in its harshest aspects.  I keep saying, do you know, to
people who tell me what a--with regret--even the Catholic
Church--my own Catholic Church, which regrets what it did to the
Indian, and I keep saying, `Well, you know, maybe--maybe you did--you
were cruel to the Indian.  But the more interesting fact is that we
stole the baby Jesus.' The baby Jesus does not live in Europe.
The baby Jesus has moved to Acapulco.  He now
wears sunglasses in Acapulco.
<p>
He lives with us, and that the most interesting thing about the
Spanish-Colonial adventure in Latin America may
been not that the Franciscan priests forced
the Eucharist down the Indians' throat; the most interesting thing is
that the Indian swallowed the Franciscan priest.  She forgot to close
her mouth.
<p>
In 1531, there is this story in Mexico of the Virgin de Guadalupe,
who's the great patron saint of Mexico.  It's a most interesting
story.  You may believe it as you will or not, but in 1531, the story
goes, that the Virgin Mary, dressed as an Aztec princess--and you may
see her all over the United States where there are Mexicans
the Virgin Mary, dressed as an Indian--not only an Indian, but an
Aztec princess, speaking the language of the Aztecs, addresses a
Spaniard--a convert to Catholicism, an Indian, who may or may not
have existed, and tells him to go into Mexico City to tell the Spanish
bishop that she wants a church here.  And it's sort of like J.  Alfred
Proofrock.  OK.  He--you know, he doesn't have the big words.  He
says, you know, `I'm not Prince Hamlet nor was meant to be.  You know,
I'm an attendant, Lord, one that will do this ...(unintelligible)
progress.' Get somebody else, you know?
<p>
She says, `No, I want you.' So four times he goes to Mexico City, and
three times the bishop thinks he's out of his mind.  And, of course,
secular friends of mine say, `Well, of course, this whole
story is some kind of Spanish contrivance.' I said, `Well, maybe, it
is a Spanish contrivance,' but what's
interesting to me about the story is that the Indians liked the story.
And I think to myself, `What did the Indians like about the story?'
Well, four times the Indian has to go see the bishop and four
times the bishop is reluctant, and that in 1531, the Virgin Mary,
dressed as an Aztec princess, sends the Indian to convert the Spanish
bishop.  She has revolutionized the dynamic of
colonialism in 1531.  I think to myself, `That's sort of interesting,
the Indian converting the Spaniard.'
<p>
And there she is, on my plates at the yuppie restaurant in Santa
Monica, you know, they put that Virgin of
Guadalupe--she's sort of the patron saint of all the yuppies who live
in the Hollywood canyons.  I don't know where they got her, but
there she is.  And who would have guessed that she would end up
in some home of a British artist friend of mine who lives in the
Hollywood hills.  There she is, over his bed, and I think to myself,
`I don't even begin to wonder about the dynamic of assimilation.
It is so wild and so unpredictable that it's wonderful.'
<p>
Yes.
<p>
ABNER MIKVA:  You came across to me--and to carry out
what Larry was asking about--you came across as a cosmic optimist.
You really think that things are going to be better in spite of
anything we do, and that these things are going to happen, whether
it's assimilation and stealing each other's culture and so
on, and I sense that you're not basically upset or dismayed
about this happening.  It's going to happen.  And that's much
more--it's much easier to hear than what Kevin Phillips was trying to
tell us yesterday.  He came across to me as a very
pessimistic bean-counter, and I'd much rather hear you, besides
which you're more poetic.
<p>
But the question is you're not suggesting that there are things
that both the dominant and the subordinate groups can do about
this assimilation process to ease the pains.  As you indicated, there
are pains connected with it.  And I think that's what this group sort
of sees its task as doing, is what can we do to make sure that there
aren't any more broken heads than there have to be?
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Well, in those human ways that you are
compassionate--I don't mean to be careless about that.  And I
don't mean to celebrate the LA riot as an event as a
carnival.  It was a terrible, terrible--people died and people
were beaten.  And it was a calamity to Los Angeles.  But I
also say that something was born there.  I don't know how
else to deny that.  You know that... <p>

MIKVA:  Can we not borne that thing that happened there
without--and somehow minimize, diminish the anguish that the
country had. <p>

RODRIGUEZ:  That's a very interesting question.  I'm not sure we
can.  I've never been forced to say that and I'm
not inclined to want to advertise that opinion, but I
think sometimes culture, civilization gets created out of great chaos
and negativity. <p>

My optimism comes only out of a sense of finally the sense
that people need to survive.  People love their children.  People want
to protect their children.  People want the best for their children.
I'm so moved, all over the world, when you see people in movement,
looking for something better.  Nothing to do with choice,
--something to do with some kind of animal instinct, to seek
the new, to seek something improved.  That this committee would
stand and would try to make Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, or
New York sort of more tolerant of that human need, I see as a
useful function, but at some other level I also say, you know, this is
going to happen regardless of whether we like it or not.
<p>
Yes.
<p>
WILLIAM JULIUS WILSON:  Your optimism is refreshing.  And you didn't
choose a title "Immigration and the Fracturing of Community," but you 
did talk briefly about competition at the bottom between,
you know, the broad category Hispanic and blacks.  Could you
elaborate a bit more on the nature of this competition, the
short- or long-term consequences of this competition, and also would
you be willing to entertain some thoughts about social policy options
that ought to be considered, that might minimize any adverse social
effects from this competition? <p>

RODRIGUEZ:  Let me go backwards.  It seems to me that one of the
great sins that the so-called Hispanic movement has committed against
black America in the last 25 or 30 years is this very casual use
of analogy, that we were, by analogy, comparable to black America and
that the solutions to our predicament were to be found in
the solutions of black America. <p>

I do not think that is the case.  I think that the dynamic
of the experience of Hispanicity is a very different one,
and certainly for Mexicans, the experience of being in the Southwest
is very different from that of blacks in the Southwest.  There
were towns, for example, in Texas, which imported Mexicans as a way of
not having to rely on black labor.  There was a
a possibility of interracial marriage for Mexicans,
especially light-skinned Mexicans for generations that was not
the case for blacks. <p>

And this political use of analogies to
justify one's position or to explain one's position by reference to
the black experience seems to me to be not only historically
fallacious, but extremely casual about the distinctiveness
of group experiences, that in the first hand.
<p>
I want to say something almost the reverse now, and that was that I
think it is absolutely urgent that black Americans come to terms with
the fact that it is no lo--and certainly in places like Los Angeles,
that it is not living in a white world, that the future--I mean,
instead of worrying about the white university, it seems to me that by
the year 2000--I think it's 2004 or 2005, all nine campuses of
University of California--all nine campuses will be predominantly
Asian in the majority.  The whole dynamic of racism
and affirmative action that we've been arguing about for the
last 30 years, what will it mean in an Asian campus?  How will we
begin to describe what that dynamic is?  What is the
future for black teen-agers in the Chinese city of San Francisco?
<p>
That's the interesting question for me.  And there is, right now,
a kind of myopia in black leadership that just insists on
that black and white conversation.  I think it's extremely dangerous,
extremely narrow, narrow focus. <p>

Did you want to remark on that? <p>

MICHAEL PIORE:  Well, I mean, I just want to introduce the other view, and
that is...
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Yes, please.
<p>
PIORE:  ...and that is that all these predictions about how the
country is going to be 25 percent Hispanic or 25 percent--what--in the
Census in 10 years or 15 years or 25 years, never come true.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Absolutely.
<p>
PIORE:  And they don't come true because people reclassify
themselves.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Absolutely.
<p>
PIORE:  And the way they reclassify themselves is that all these
other groups turn white.  And so--I mean, there is capacity for the--I
mean,
I think you underestimate, in the way you present this picture, the
capacity of the race issue, the division in American society between
black and white to reassert itself on the map of 
this changing culture.  I mean, I could describe my own family
experience and I'm no more purely American and I've no
more heritage of slavery or anything in a fundamental sense
than you do. <p>

And yet I've come in, as a third-generation immigrant, to see the
world and understand American society in terms of black
and white.  And I've become white, although, that is in
terms of the way this thing was structured, initially.
In the way in which my ancestors were classified in the
Census, I'm no more white than you are.
<p>
And so I mean, I think there is reason to--you
know, to think maybe this will break down and so on, but I think
that the picture you describe underestimates the capacity of
this division between--that is the capacity of however much
American culture changes, and I mean, what I
think you really do capture is the fluidity of culture, the way it
changes, the way language changes, the way American society has the
ability to change. <p>

And yet, there are certain themes that manage to persist for reasons
that are really hard, perhaps, to understand, given the amount of
change, and one of those themes is the way in which we have
this ability to see the society in terms of black and
white--and I mean, just to re-emphasize that, when you go to Latin
America, people don't see the world in terms of black and white, and
they have a vocabulary and they recognize a whole spectrum of
color.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Everything--yes.
<p>
PIORE:  And yet every time--it's not just me, but it's
certainly me--I walk through the world and I classify everybody
automatically in the back of my head as either black or white, and it
has very little to do with what their actual color is.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Do you see me as black or white?
<p>
PIORE:  I see you as white...
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  As white.
<p>
PIORE:  ...if you'll excuse my--you know, I...
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Can I--there's a...
<p>
PIORE:  And I think that  that is something which is
carried by the culture.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  There's a moment in de Tocqueville.  It's one of the
most astonishing episodes, and when he comes on an Indian and an
African woman walking together--do you know the moment?--and he sees
them--he, the great European on his horse, and he sees
them, and the moment in which they see him, the Indian makes
a run for it into the forest.  And the African waits for him to
approach.  And de Tocqueville, he, the great white man on his horse,
sees in that different, but similar reaction
the mutual tragedy of both races, he says.  The African is
too indebted and too held by her relationship to the
white, too needing of the white approval.  The Indian is too haughty,
too unwilling to co-exist with the white and so forth.
But nowhere does he wonder what the black and the Indian were
talking about; or why they were so easy together; or what this other
relationship was about that had nothing to do with him?
<p>
Now you tell me that the Indian is white.  I tell you that this Indian
went into the forest and she ran away from the white man.
I tell you that there are relationships in America now that are
forming that do not assume the centrality of the white in
the experience, and that to get back to Professor Wilson's
question, I think there needs to be a
conversation in America, for example, the chapter that never gets
written in the history books that I've read, that has to do with, for
example, with the black-Indian marriage, which was one of the most
extraordinary stories of American meeting, American union, in
the middle of a calamity, suffered by both peoples, that nonetheless
happens, so that every African-American friend of mine will say in the
middle of the conversation, `Oh, by the way, did you know my
grandmother was a Cherokee?' I mean, that Cherokee
grandmother sure got around because she's in every family that I know
of and it seems to me that there are other conversations that need to
be raised now, that are not simply through the mediation of the
white specter and maybe even the feminist movement, which is trying
not to establish a conversation among women, that has nothing to do
with Alexis de Tocqueville as a man.  Maybe that's part of the same
impulse in our time.
<p>
Yes.

<p>
CASS SUNSTEIN:  Yes.  These are some remarks about
identity.  Malcolm X once looking over a black audience
said--the white man says, `You're black.  Turn around, look at
yourselves.  You're 1,001 different colors.' And the Federalist
10--let's go back a couple centuries--the Federalist 10 was about the
problem, really, in some ways of identity politics though it had a
different dimension and the idea was that small polities tend to break
down into sharply defined two or three groups and those commonalities
impossible.  So what you want to do is make it so there are 1,001
different colors.  And the way you do that is to enlarge the sphere.
And the idea was with a large sphere, you'd have 1,001 and if you had
1,001 you have a kind of universalism.
<p>
Now we could compare Malcolm X, who's 1,001 different colors, he said,
looking over a black audience, and said something quite like that
about the world after coming back from Mecca.  You can compare that
with the idea--with the images of one group swallowing another
and then being swallowed by the other group, which is a kind
of non-Federalist 10 and non-Malcolm X conception of how people define
themselves.  And we can distinguish that from kind of--might call it
liberal utopianism, which is a conception of identity as
multiplicitous and involving innumerable diverse characteristics.  So that 
when I see you, I guess I should say
I don't see a Mexican or Hispanic.  I see someone who has, you know,
innumerable characteristics and most of them are commonly held.  And on
that view, the difference between liberal utopianism and identity
politics, to
the extent that there is one, is identity politics is really insistent on
one
or two characteristics as defining.  And that gives rise to the notion
that if
my grandchild, let's say, is Mexican, that that's a problem or a plausible
description even. <p>
Now what I couldn't figure out is whether your remarks--I guess this is
why it
was an essay or like poetry.  I couldn't figure out whether it was a
criticism
of liberal utopianism or a celebration.  I have components of both.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  You know, I think of Tiger Woods and I think to myself
of this controversy now about whether or not we should have a
mixed-race category--again, this choice--should we acknowledge the reality
or
should we pretend that it doesn't exist, and the argument among black
civil rights groups right now is really rather furious about whether or
not this is diminishment of black identity, because after all it's
not simply the way we are, it is the way we are perceived that
is key.  The problem with that argument, of course, is that you define
yourself--not unreasonably, but you define yourself through the eyes of
your
oppressor.  And as an American, there's something about that that I
don't like.  I really believe in self-determination.
<p>
I remember when once Bill Moyers asked me how I thought of myself, as
an American or Hispanic.  I said,  'I'm Chinese.'  And that's because I
live
in a Chinese city and that's because I want to be Chinese.  Well, why not?
And you take it away from me, you know, if you're man enough to take it
away
from me.
<p>
I think it's a celebration of utopianism.  I do think the
distinctions exist.  That is, I do think we are moving
perhaps in response to this observation, I'm not talking
about an America tomorrow in which it's going to find black and white no
longer the distinguishing marks of separateness.  But for many, many
young people, that I meet, it sounds almost Victorian to talk about their
identity now that way.  They don't think of themselves in those terms.
And
they think of--they're already moving into a world in which skin or tattoo
or ornament or movement or commune or sexuality or drug are sort of
the organizing principles of their identity.  And the notion that they are
white or black doesn't--simply doesn't apply to them.  And increasingly,
of
course, you meet children who really don't know how to say what they are
anymore.  They simply are too many things.  We're in such a world--in
such an America, what will this body say?  We still live in a black and
white
America?  I mean, what do we say to Tiger Woods who insisted he's not
African,
because that would deny his mother's existence.
<p>
I met a young girl in San Diego the other day who told me--this was at a
convention of mixed race children, in which the common habit is to define
one
parent over the other.  In most white and black marriages, the habit is to
define black over white.  But this girl said that her mother was
Mexican and her father was African.  I said, `What are you?'  She said,
`Black-xican.'  And I think to myself, `You know, the vocabulary
that the Spanish empire has, the recognition of multiplicity of
possibilities, we do not have in this so--we do not have words to describe
who
we are anymore.  And if we rely, I tell you, if we rely on the old
vocabulary, we are doomed because no one is using it anymore.  They're
inventing their own words.  Yes.
<p>
EDNA ULLMANN-MARGALIT:  I guess I'll go back to what Larry Lessig said
before
that I hear a lot of description in what you say and also I hear a lot of
poetry in what you say and I'm still wondering about the way we're
supposed to take this story.  I mean, what is the narrative we tell
ourselves?
What is, if you want, even the myth that we want--or the mythology we want
to
have about those facts?  To say assimilation happens is one thing.  To ask
whether we like it or don't like it is another.  And what is the story
that we
want to tell?
<p>
Now I want to go back, if you'll allow me, just for a second.  You know,
in a
way back to basics as far as I understand this country.  There used
to be a time of a melting pot ideology and this melting pot ideology is no
longer around.  I come from a country where also a melting pot
ideology was the dominant one and it's no longer around.  And what
replaces it
is something which is fracturing and something like multicultural or
culture
of diversity and each group or color or ethnicity celebrates its own
identity.  And the question still is:  What is the story we tell
ourselves?
Do we want to adopt a story of a diversity?  Or do we want to adopt a
story 
that leads towards the assimilation that you are describing in an
optimistic way? <p>

I, in fact, want to ask you one particular question which is:  I hear in
what you--there's some economic story to this and Professor
Wilson mentioned, you know, that competition at the bottom there it--the
story
of the movement you told us is a movement pushed mostly by trying to get a
better life and so on.  But the assimilation story you are telling, I
wonder
if you agree or if you want to comment on the fact that the assimilation,
if
it happens, it's all about marriage and intermarriage.  When you say, `The
grandchild may be Mexican.'  That this is a way to assimilation.  If we
are
willing to accept that, this is perhaps the only path that assimilation
can happen.  Do we want this?  Are we fearful of this?  What is the story
we
tell ourselves about our daughters marrying ...
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Let me get to your largest question,
what myth do we tell ourselves?  You know, I think the person who
got closest to it was Karl Marx.  Marx said that--he predicted that
the discovery of gold in California would be a more central
event to the Americas than the discovery of the Americas by Columbus.  And
I think what he goes on to write--this was only in a brief essay.  He
goes on to write that the discovery of the Americas by Columbus was only
the meeting of two tribes, essentially:  the European and the
Indian.  But he said, `You know, when gold was discovered in California in
the
1840s, the entire world met.'  That for the first time in human history,
all
of the known world gathered.  The Malaysian was in the gold fields
along side the African, along side the Chinese, along side the Australian,
along side the American pioneer, etc., etc., etc.
<p>
For the first time and with calamitous results, the world was seeking
gold in the same place at the same time, and they were at each other's
throats, people were murdered and so forth.  But that was an event
without parallel and it is, I think, the beginning of modern California
and why California, today, really is the mythology.  It provides the
mythological structure for understanding how we might talk about the
American experience as not being biracial, but the experience of the
re-creation of the worlds--the re-creation of the known world in the New
World.
<p>
MARGALIT:  Yeah.  If I may just...
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Yes.
<p>
MARGALIT:  One sentence further.  To me, American was--is a country of
immigration.  In a way, many years ago, some decades ago, this discussion
would have been extremely eerie to have, you know, `Where do we stand on
immigration?'  Immigration is what this country is about and this country
is a
country of immigrants.  Now why is it not eerie to us, today, to talk
about
immigration?
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Well, there...
<p>
MARGALIT:  Perhaps one reason is that we--the worry, really, is illegal
immigration.  That's one thing and not...
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  That's one thing.
<p>
MARGALIT:  And the other is whether still--I'm trying to understand
whether this country understands itself as a country of immigrations.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Hmm.
<p>
MARGALIT:  And of assimilation.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  There...
<p>
MARGALIT:  Or has it stopped understanding itself that way.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  There was a book taken with great seriousness by
the East Coast two years ago called "Alien Nation" by a man named Peter
Brimelow--Peter Brimelow who, I think, he's a South African become a
Briton, become a Canadian, become an American who ends up writing a book
about
how we don't really need very many more immigrants in this country and his
publisher--a man named Evans, who is married to this dreadful woman who
runs the New Yorker, he took that book around to the Congress and gave a
copy to each congressman.  And one of the arguments that Brimelow makes in
that book is that--not simply that we didn't need anymore immigrants, but
that
this country should think very seriously about whether we need
non-European
immigrants, whether we can tolerate Asian and Hispanic immigrants
particularly.  Whether they are not so alien to the American experience
that
they introduce mythologies and come at the country from points of
view that are absolutely dangerous.
<p>
You know, you think back to the way the Chinese were treated in the 19th
century in California and it is quite clear that something about the Asian
immigrant did not sit easily with this nation of immigrants.  And it was
more
troublesome than Protestant and the Catholic and Jew.  It was that
they were coming at the country from a totally new direction.  They were
restricted in their movements within the cities.  They
were normally excluded and kept to the outskirts of town or
within Chinatowns.  They were kept from reuniting with their wives.
The inclination was once their labor was
done, send them back.  And the number of Chinese in California
who escaped that tyranny only by ending going East--`Go East, young
man'--in order to escape the tyranny of that anti-Chinese behavior on the
West, is still very much alive and I think in California.
<p>
There is a fear right now of Asia that on the West Coast that very
much has to do with the fact that we don't know--it's not simply about the
immigrant, it's specifically about those immigrants.  We don't
know what to make of them, frankly.  We don't know whether they fit into
the
American scheme of things.  That's the answer to the question.
<p>
Your question about marriage I think is absolutely right.  I don't know
whether marriage is the word I would use.  Certainly eroticism--I find
that we
are falling in love with each other all the time.  And people desire each
other and people want each other.  You know, I think to myself--you know,
the day Columbus arrived in 1492, the Indians came out to greet him and
the historians have always said, `Oh, you know, pity that tribe.  They
were
all to die of the plague.'  You know, and I think to myself, `Well, hell,
you
know, maybe they died of the plague, but don't miss the point.  I mean,
they
were curious about these people.  They saw these people and like the cast
from
some soap opera and they were getting off a boat and I'd be curious, too.'
<p>
You know, this is within the human mind to be interested in
something that is new.  And ultimately I might even be in love with them.
I
might be in love with that which was foreign to me.  The possibility of
even
wanting to become them, of wanting to eat them.  I wanted to eat you
people in
this room a long time.  And I still do.
<p>
AMY GUTMANN:  Two comments on a talk that was wonderful to
listen to and to think about.  One is, at the beginning, you distinguished
Hispanics from blacks by saying there is no Hispanic race.  Well, there is
no
black race either...
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  That's true.  Yes.
<p>
GUTMANN:  ...and there's no Asian race.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  Exactly.
<p>
GUTMANN:  And so there is no distinction there.  There's a distinction
between the experience of people who are identified and identify as black
or
Hispanic Americans in this country by the facts of slavery, discrimination
that has roots that are unlike the discrimination that any other group,
whether it be Jews or Hispanics of all the sorts that you spoke about,
have
had.  And I think that's an a--I mean, that's not a common thought among
Americans.  I mean, most Americans do see if there is any race they really
believe there is a race, at least, of blacks.  But the genetic differences
that can be accounted for by the difference between Asians and Caucasians
is
1-100th of a percent--.0001 of all the genetic differences between us can
be
count--OK.
<p>
The second observation is much more positive.  It goes to
something about immigration that you're talking about.  Immigrate--there's
always been a force--this is a country among other things--I mean, one of
the
predominant aspects of this country is it's a country of immigrants.  But
there's always been a lot of resistance to that and a lot of political
and social battle over immigration and the question for you is if what you
have talked about--which I accept and I think needs more voice in this
country--is how many lives in this country have been enriched and bettered
and
are wonderful because of the fact of immigration and intermarriage and
cultural exchanges so it's all mixed up in a morally good way.  I
mean, and in an aesthetically good way, often.
<p>
I mean, there are bad aspects to it, too.  You know, there are bad things
that
can happen this way, too.  But if we exalt that, as you do, surely
there are arguments that flow from that for what kind of health-care
policy,
see what kind of immigration policy we have, do we educate--I mean, there
are
lots of policy arguments about whether illegal or legal immigrants should
get
health care, should get education, should--how they should be treated by
our
civic associations.    There are different religious--do some
religious groups exclude blacks?  I mean, the history of Mormons and
blacks
has not been a pretty one in this country.
<p>
So I'm just begging you not to resist some of the policy implications of
the
kind of wonderful exaltation that you have and that your life represents
of
the kind of mixing that can happen in this country if people welcome
it as opposed to resist it.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  No, I don't resist it.  I came to you today...
<p>
GUTMANN:  No, you don't.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  I came to you today, though, as a journalist.  And
to describe an America that I see forming.  And I'm not a
policy--my interest is not in policy or in the determinations of
a body like this.  I respect your deliberations.  But
I'm much more interested in the reportage at this moment than I am in any
conclusions.  I do think that there are very serious policy considerations
of
this sort that you're raising.  I do think, however, that
sometimes the truly revolutionary things that are going on in
this society are sort of happening almost regardless and almost without
anybody being aware of them.  I mean, I tell you, we are going to
wake up one day and it's all going to be changed and we're going to say,
`When did it all change?  You know, why didn't The New York Times
tell us it was going to happen?  You know, where was Maureen Dowd
when we needed her?'  You know, she was going on about Bill Clinton's sex
life.
<p>
I agree very much with your
comment about the `no black race.' There is no white race either
to make the point over here.  There are mythologies and I'm in the
business of--insofar as I'm in any business at all of demythologizing of
these identities, and suggesting their complexity and the
dynamism of individuals to meet and learn and fall
in love with people different from themselves.  That much is very much
what
I've examined in testimony today.  And that's all I
give you, that this is a very complicated pr--I have only time for one
more
question and there was a patient questioner on this side.
<p>
DAVID BROMWICH:  Thank you.  I guess--I'm from California, too, and I
regard your talk as not at all poetic but scientific.
<p>
Let me just briefly characterize a view that I think is fairly
prevalent and ask you what you think of it, though, I think I know.  And
it's a view about culture, which says that cultural
identity informs personal identity, that if you don't have it, something
that
gives you density, texture, thickness, robustness--that really
characterizes
you in a way that mere individuality can never do, that that's going to be
missing from your life, and that therefore the good of this Canadian
concept
of multiculturalism is it gives us identity in the main way that makes
later on individuality possible.
<p>
I think that's a very--somewhat guilty--but a very prevalent, right now,
liberal mainstream view, which for all I know Bill Clinton means to
endorse or
has--have thought through and--and goes go along with.  And I just wonder
what the implications for that view are in the description you've offered
of
California and Mexico.
<p>
RODRIGUEZ:  I'd offer the countertheory and that is to really
become--you know, I've worked with gang kids as a reporter.  I did a piece
for a German magazine recently with these kids who are as
far from being Huck Finn as you could imagine American kids of 14 and 15
as
being.  At a very point in which you'd expect them to sort of get on the
raft and go down the Mississippi, they are, in fact, looking for family.
They
are, in fact, looking for home.  They are, in fact, looking for blood.
They
are, in fact, looking for Canada.  And they insist that this little motley
group of murderers that they have with them is their bro',
their clan.  These guys will stay with them.  These
guys--`He's my bro' and he's going to watch my back.
This is my real family.'
<p>
And I think to myself, you know, did I read Huck Finn or was that some
kind of Irish thing that the nun gave me that didn't make any
sense in my--I thought American teen-agers wanted to leave home; I thought
they wanted to sort of get on with it, you know, find out what's on the
other
side of town.  Increasingly, because American teen-agers do not have
family
lives that are recognizable, they are turning now at points in which
we might have expected some kind of movement into the public realm, they
are turning very privatistic and looking for communes or for family
in adolescence.
<p>
And it's one of the most perplexing things about the American
experience.  We're almost unwriting it at this moment.  The business that
you--which suggests to me that the people who are really going to be the
individuals in our society, in the coming generation, are going to be
coming
from strong Chinese, strong Russian, strong Mexican families.  In other
words,
you can only become an 'I' in the public realm after you have a strong
sense
of we in the private realm, it seems to me.  At least that was my own
progress. <p>

As to cultural identity, it seems to me also that one of the things we
did not talk about now, because we have used certain, and I think,
arbitrarily, certain Canadian/Richard Nixon categories as ways of talking
about our culture.  We use those as sort of the determinant ways of
understanding who we are or how we understand it ourselves.  Well, I don't
think of myself as Mexican.  I think of myself more powerfully as Spanish
Catholic.  I think of myself very powerfully as Californian.  I think of
myself very powerfully as homosexual.  I live with a gay community that
I don't make.  I live culturally within five or six cultural
families and the notion that one Canadian designation is sort of
the way I'm living my life, it's just not true.
<p>
The problem that most kids are having right now is that they live
with too many cultures, and they don't know how to negotiate between those
different cultures, which are often clashing.  My Catholicism and
my homosexuality, for example, and the fact that I have
allegiance to more than one culture, I have friendships in one culture
that do
not extend to the other culture.  And I end up wending my way among
five or six or seven different cultures.  And the notion that Canada
offers me
is finally too sterile, too simple, so sad.  And I remember standing in
Toronto--I was speaking to the Canadian Library Association--I had a
wonderful
opening line.  I said that Canada had always struck me as the largest
country
in the world that doesn't exist.  Nobody laughed.
<p>
And here we were, we were at this motel and near the airport at Toronto
and all these planes were coming in from Bombay and from Buffalo and here
we were like Victorians, you know, talking about culture as though it was
this
little thing we brought from the old country, you know, and that that's
what
we were going to hold true to.  And the Canadian government
actually supports Croatian ethnicities that are, I find,
Nazi in their ideology.  But let that pass for the moment
and when we talk our multiculturalism.  And I thought to myself, you
know what did the teen-agers of Toronto, what could they make of this
room except that we are like some kind of Victorian princess who simply
does not realize that the world underneath her petticoat is very muddy and
messy.  And that she belongs, at least, to five or six cultures already.
And that is what it means to be American.  That is certainly what it means
to
be of California in 1997.
<p>
I come to you as a man of many cultures.  I come to you as a Chinese and
unless you understand that I am Chinese, then you've not understood
anything
I've said to you today.  Thank you very much.
<p>
STEPHEN P. STEINBERG:  OK.  Thank you, Richard Rodriguez and Joyce Appleby
for
a really fascinating discussion this morning.  We're going to break now to
move into the individual working groups.  You can take about five minutes
to
get a cup of coffee or something to drink.  As a reminder, the group on
Culture and Behavior will meet in the--let me get my rooms right--the
Exhibit
Room, which is the room going out to your right.  The group on Leadership
in a
Democratic Society will meet in the Reading Room, which is the room on the
left, where Cheryl Faulkner has been the last two days.  And the group on
21st Century Community will meet in the Lounge Room, which is behind the
stage
just going through the door to your left, over there.
<p>
It is now about five after 11.  The working groups can go as late as 1:00.
We
will then come back into this room--which will be reset for lunch--have
lunch and then--resume with the afternoon sessions.
<p>
A reminder, we gave you lists of suggested participants in each of the
working groups.  Those are only our kind of rough and ready suggestions as
to
where you might find the discussion most interesting.  If you would prefer
to
be part of a different group, please feel free to go there.  If you would
let
one of the staff members know that that's your preference, either during
the
session or afterwards, that would be helpful to us in keeping track.
<p>
Going forward, it is certainly possible to be part of more than one
working
group conversation.  And if you let us know, we will help you arrange
that.  So take a brief coffee break and then let's move into the working
groups.  Thank you. <p>
