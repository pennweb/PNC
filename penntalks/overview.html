  </TR>
  <TR ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
    <TD><FONT SIZE="+1">PennTalks is a program led by the <A HREF="http://www.upenn.edu/pnc/ptsplash.html">Penn
      Public Talk Project</A> and co-sponsored by the <A HREF="http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~ua/">UA</A>
      and <A HREF="www.upenn.edu/civichouse/">Civic House</A>. It is
      a unique opportunity for students to reflect on their experiences
      and to identify their hopes, dreams, and aspirations for the
      Penn community through a series of small group conversations
      in their college houses, fraternities, sororities, interest organizations,
      or any place that <A HREF="http://www.upenn.edu/">Penn</A> students
      get together. Findings from the group conversations will be presented
      to <A HREF="http://www.upenn.edu/president/rodin/">President
      Judith Rodin</A> and other Penn leaders to provide them with
      a better understanding of student visions of their university.</FONT></TD>

    <TD ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE="+1">Students are invited to participate
      as either facilitators or members of a group. The program starts
      with facilitator training on Friday, March 3, with meetings set
      to take place over the next few weeks. To participate, all you
      need to do is go to the <A HREF="http://www.upenn.edu/pnc/penntalks/registration.html/">PennTalks
      registration page</A>, tell us a little about yourself, and we
      will get back to you with the times and places that group conversations
      will occur.</FONT></TD>

      <H1>Why should I participate?</H1>
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE="+1">By being a part of PennTalks,
      you can share your unique thoughts and feelings on Penn -- as
      it is now and as it could be in the future -- directly with other
      students and, in distilled form, to Dr. Rodin and the rest of
      the Penn community. Facilitators will receive professional training
      that they will be able to use later in a variety of academic,
      workplace, and community environments. (And it wouldn't be a
      bad item on your resume&acute; either!)</FONT></TD>

      <H1>What will happen in my group conversation?</H1>

    <TD ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE="+1">A conversation features a
      small group of individuals learning from one another in an interactive,
      collaborative manner. Discussion guides will be distributed in
      advance to all participants. The guides will feature a variety
      of questions and alternate viewpoints designed to stimulate discussion.
      Specially trained student volunteer facilitators will lead the
      conversations.</FONT></TD>

      <H1>What will the facilitators do?</H1>

  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE="+1">Facilitators will lead the
      discussions, listen, and record the results of the group conversation.
      They will receive formal training on Friday, March 3. They will
      set-up a group of their choice. Together with a partner, they
      will lead two sessions over the course of the next month. At
      each session, one facilitator will direct the conversation and
      insure that everyone present has the opportunity to fully participate
      in the process. The other will act as note-taker, and will assist
      in leading the dialogue. All facilitators will reconvene as a
      group on Friday, April 7 to identify the major themes which emerged
      at their sessions. They will also report back to Dr. Rodin on
      April 14.</FONT></TD>

      <H1>What is the Penn Public Talk Project?</H1>
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE="+1">The Penn Public Talk Project
      is a program of the <A HREF="http://www.upenn.edu/pnc/">Penn
      National Commission on Society, Culture and Community</A>. The
      PNC was convened and chaired by President Rodin in December 1996
      &quot;to address the polarization, oversimplification, and isolation
      from important cultural and intellectual traditions that are
      increasingly characteristic of contemporary social and political
      discourse.&quot; Programs developed by the Penn Public Talk Project
      embody the central insights of the Commission, that the most
      productive public discourse integrates rational deliberation
      with personal narrative and relational features to strengthen
      communities. Such fully realized, robust discourse enables citizens
      of diverse backgrounds and opinions to do real work together
      on issues of perceived consequence and importance in their own
      lives and communities.</FONT></TD>
