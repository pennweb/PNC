<b>Approach and Methodology</b>
<p>
</center>
	In an effort to discover how private sector leadership can affect
public policy outcomes, I have undertaken a review of the use and
regulation of tobacco in the United States.  My sources are limited (1)
and not original.  I did teach the recent FDA rulemaking proceeding on
tobacco in a course at Penn Law School two years ago.  David Kessler
addressed my class and described how he personally interacted with
President Clinton to gain his support the FDA rule (which of course led to
the tobacco settlement now before Congress).  Other than that, I am no
expert.  And as a former smoker, who saw what emphysema can do to family
members, I am not just an academic observer.  But as a student of public
policy, I am fascinated by how the approach to tobacco has evolved in a
relatively short time.  What is remarkable is how far we have come in
recognizing the public health consequences of tobacco use and (as
importantly) how much this is due to a small number of individuals from
the private and public sectors, as opposed to a coordinated and sustained
legislative/executive effort. 
<p>

	I will first summarize the history of tobacco use and its health
consequences and highlight  significant events that produced leaders who
have made a difference, whether positive or negative.  Given the enormous
economic force that tobacco has become, it is all the more surprising that
its ultimate control by public officials could have happened at all, let
alone so quickly.  Remaining issues have to do with how Congress and the
President will legislate the tobacco settlement.   Even after the legal
issues are resolved, the moral and ethical issues of tobacco promotion and
sales (even if no longer to minors) remain lively in the United States and
unaddressed concerning consumption abroad.  I will close by speculating on
how individual leaders managed to emerge in tobacco reform and try to
identify their leadership characteristics.

<b>A Brief Review of the Tobacco Story to 1964</b>
<P>
</center>
	The surprising thing about the history of tobacco in Western
Society is not so much how pervasive its presence has been, but how
controversial its use has been.  As Schudson records, James I published an
anti-tobacco tract in 1604 which even emphasized what today we would call
the dangers of secondary smoke.  But moral objections, even then, were
overcome by profit motives.  By 1607 the Virginia company had landed in
Jamestown with the goal of producing tobacco profits for the English
crown.  Throughout the 18th century tobacco use was encouraged.  But even
as a pervasive consumer good, it still retained a "faintly immoral"
reputation.  It always had friends in high places, however. Thomas
Jefferson was a proponent of its use and saw profits for government in its
taxation and distribution.  This position  is reminiscent of what is
happening today with tobacco taxes being used as the source of regulatory
capital. <p>

	With the advent of the cigarette in the 19th century, tobacco
became even more widely used.  The mechanization of cigarette production,
the brain child of James Buchanan Duke and his American Tobacco Company,
dropped the cost of producing a cigarette dramatically in the decade
between 1880 and 1890.  In effect, "Buck" Duke, whose statue with a cigar
in hand presides proudly  over the Duke campus to this day, was among the
first real 
"leaders" of the tobacco movement.  As the Henry Ford of
tobacco production, he made the product vastly more available and
affordable. <p>

	Schudson's paper also documents the growth of the anti-tobacco
movement in the 19th century, lead by the Seventh Day Adventists and
leaders like Dr. John Harvey Kellogg.  The Women's Christian Temperance
Union (WCTU) actively opposed tobacco along with liquor, and successfully
supported state legislation to prohibit tobacco sales to minors.  (State
laws prohibiting sales to minors have been on the books since the 1880s.)
<p>

	At the beginning of the 20th century the WCTU and other
anti-tobacco advocates were very active, even in the face of American
Tobacco's mass production achievements that were enhanced by its
cartel-like economic power.  The tobacco trust was one of Teddy
Roosevelt's early antitrust targets and breaking its hold on cigarette
production ironically ensured greater production at lower prices. <p>

	A watershed period in the early anti-tobacco movement occurred
during World War I.  Over the objection of many private sector leaders,
the government included cigarettes in soldiers' rations when they went
overseas.   General John Pershing was reported to have said: "You ask me
what we need to win this war.  I answer tobacco, as much as bullets."
(Schudson p. 10)  This effort created a set of veteran consumers who
returned from the war to lead the charge against anti-tobacco legislation.
<p>

	In the 1920s cigarette usage spread as women turned to cigarettes
for the first time (emboldened perhaps by the passage of the 16th
Amendment extending them the right to vote).  Schudson reports that
cigarette consumption per capita "was remarkably steady from 1913 to 1945,
rising when the real income per capita rose, falling when  real income
fell."  During this period the sales of  big tobacco companies grew.  They
benefitted from a reaction against the moral arguments of anti-tobacco
activists.  The medical evidence against tobacco was slow to form. The
medial profession, was largely supportive of the public perception that
moderate smoking was not hazardous to health.  (A notable exception was
Dr. Alton Ochsner who suggested a connection between cigarette smoking and
lung cancer in the 1930s and 1940s.)  During War II cigarette use was
reinforced among the military, which once again became the largest
distributor of "free" cigarettes. <p>

	In the 1950s, more research emerged from Ochsner and others that
connected smoking to lung cancer. A Readers Digest article entitled
"Cancer By The Carton" led to a temporary decline in cigarette use.  (It
was temporary because cigarette manufacturers responded by extensively
promoting the "safe" filter-tip cigarette.)  The American Cancer Society
adopted a resolution in 1954 recognizing an association between smoking
and lung cancer and in 1958 the Consumers Union supported this research.
During this period, the Federal Trade Commission challenged as false and
misleading  cigarette advertising that made health claims and the Public
Health Service also made statements connecting the risk of cancer to
tobacco. <p>

	When President Kennedy took office in 1961, representatives of
leading anti-cancer groups urged the creation of a commission to study the
connection between cancer and smoking.  This was done under the leadership
of the Surgeon General, Luther Terry.  Incredibly Schudson reports that
during this period  "the American Medical Association remained silent on
the issue." <p>

	In sum, from 1607 to 1964 the tobacco story shows an addictive
product producing loyalty but also controversy.  The economic power of
tobacco coupled with consumer needs and desires served to expand tobacco
use. Not surprisingly the role of government (especially the military) was
if anything counter productive to public  health needs.  Leadership on the
health issue was predominantly private and often quixotic or aberrational.
Still, a regulatory direction was emerging and the stage was set for
responsible government intervention.
<p>
<center>
<b>The Period from 1964 to 1995</b>
</center>
<p>
	It is difficult to overestimate the impact of the 1964 Surgeon
General's report on the tobacco health debate.  If there is a "social
moment" this was it.  Virtually all that has transpired in the 30 plus
years since that report derives from it.  And its effect was not merely
aspirational; its impact can be measured.  Tobacco consumption in the
United States has been cut in half since that time. (2) Of course that
decline did not occur instantly.  It is a cumulative change that
benefitted from the salient actions taken in the wake of the Surgeon
General's report.  The report united the executive branch of government
behind anti-smoking efforts and converted tobacco into an overarching
public health issue. (3)<p>

	The social change that occurred in tobacco use during this 30-year
period is truly phenomenal.  Measures of the effect of government actions,
are often problematic.   Consider that during this same period, other
government programs with  more modest and less controversial goals have
foundered; for example, the effort to save lives by installing seat belts
or air bags in cars is still not fully resolved after 30 years, (4) while
tobacco is on the verge of virtually unanimously embraced legislative
control. <p>

	The tobacco regulation effort,  during  this period, is replete
with examples of effective leaders, public and private.  First in time is
Luther Terry the Surgeon General responsible for the 1964 report.  Given
the extent to which this report succeeded, General Terry deserves primacy
of recognition.  Other government officials also reacted proactively.
Michael Pertschuk as chair of the Federal Trade Commission quickly joined
in the fray.  By proposing health warning labels on cigarettes, the FTC
had a measurable effect on consumption, even though its jurisdiction was
preempted by a tobacco industry legislative alternatives in 1965 which
produced watered down warning labels.  On the other side,  tobacco state
politicians had success in  stemming the reformist tide. (5)  The medical
establishment was of little help.  The AMA failed to endorse the Surgeon
General's report. <p>

	In the private sector a few academic lawyers stood out.   John
Banzhaf at George Washington and Richard Daynard at Northeastern led
efforts on behalf of the public interest community.  Banzhaf forced the
FCC to provide time for anti-cigarette advertisements and Daynard helped
research and support tort suits by the private bar.  But the immediate
impact of the 1964 report was softened by the Vietnam War.  Just as with
World Wars I and II, the military essentially supported tobacco as  a drug
of choice (while marijuana was accepted as a necessary evil). Nonetheless
by 1975, the Army banned cigarettes from K rations. <p>

	By the 1980's the reform momentum could not be rolled back.
Non-smokers' rights legislation was enacted in many states and insurance
companies began to offer non-smoker rated policies.  Perhaps the biggest
event of the decade was the arrival of C. Everett Koop as Surgeon General.
In 1982, he issued a report on the problems of second hand smoke that soon
led to restrictions on smoking in public buildings and facilities.  In
1987, smoking was forbidden on domestic air trips and, by 1990, the ban
was made applicable to all flights.  Koop was the ideal exponent of the
anti-smokers' message.  A grandfatherly figure with an old testament
presence, he exuded absolute integrity and a fearless devotion to health.
He was the Platonic version of the Surgeon General. Many probably think he
still is the Surgeon General. <p>

	Surely tobacco companies were not going quietly.  They continued
to deny liability and won all litigation.  Big tobacco was the leading
contributor to political campaigns and this bought legislative support.
But anti-smoking legislation had adherents in both parties.   Some
republicans stood tall (such as Senator Hatch who sponsored legislation on
warning labels) and some  liberals ducked (such as President Carter, who
considered Secretary Califano's crusade against tobacco an enormous
political liability). <p>

	By the 1990's, tobacco companies were losing their  grip on the
legislative process.  President Clinton and Vice-President Gore felt
emboldened to  warn against the health consequences of tobacco use on the
eve of the campaign.  The opposition became increasingly powerless
although Senator Dole provided some light moments during the 1996 campaign
by stating that tobacco was no more addictive than cookies and milk.  His
statement was ridiculed.  The tide had clearly shifted and tobacco was on
the run.  It was soon to become a rout.
<p>

<center>
<b>From the FDA Rule,  to the Tobacco Suits, to Legislation</b><p>
</center>
	If  the pace  of tobacco reform during the thirty-year period
following the 1964 report was quick, in the last two years it has broken
the sound barrier.  The three most dramatic events include: the FDA
rulemaking proceeding; the tort suits brought by state attorneys' general;
and the tobacco legislation before Congress, which involved the testimony
of tobacco CEOs. <p>

	David Kessler was the Bush administration pediatrician/lawyer who
was reappointed by President Clinton to head the FDA. As an independent
spirit with a penchant for controversy, he turned out to be in the right
place at the right time. The FDA rulemaking proceeding posed a dilemma for
the FDA and the Clinton administration. If tobacco was regulated as a drug
it would have to be determined to be safe and effective, which it could
not be, but to ban cigarettes would create an impossible regulatory and
legal outcome.  Therefore, the approach Kessler chose was to label the
cigarette  a nicotine delivery-device and regulate its use rather than ban
it. The regulation was directed at children who constituted to the most
susceptible group of potential users. <p>

	Kessler could research and draft the rule, but he could not
announce it without administration support.  Slipping into the White House
one afternoon in 1996, Kessler spoke for several hours to President
Clinton in the course of convincing him that the rule was the right thing
to do.  (Rare, of course, is the agency rule that gets direct presidential
approval, although all such acts are "executive" in nature.)  Clinton
embraced the rule as his own and announced  in a press conference that the
protection of children through regulation of cigarette advertising was the
goal of the rule.  The  rule (even in draft form) immediately precipitated
industry legal challenges that are still working their way through the
courts. <p>

   	By now, the tobacco companies had a carton full of troubles.
Their CEOs testified before Congress that they believed nicotine was not
addictive, even as internal documents were being leaked or produced in
litigation that showed the companies knew the opposite to be true.  A
grand jury is considering perjury indictments.  But even if no indictments
are forthcoming, the damage to the industry's credibility has been massive
and irretrievable.
<p>

	The tobacco class actions filed earlier grew in scope.  State
attorney generals, led by Mike Moore of Mississippi, joined with private
plaintiffs' lawyers to produce tort actions in 40 states for recovery of
Medicaid payments and other medical costs.  It is these actions that led
to the remarkable $368 billion settlement agreement that the lawyers
negotiated in 1997.  Settlements of this magnitude are unknown in our
court system.  The tobacco companies, who so long successfully stonewalled
on liability, suddenly reversed course  and surrendered to the seemingly
inevitable forces of law and politics. <p>

	These settlements are now before Congress and legislation
enforcing them is being crafted.  By its own description of the settlement
(see N.Y. Times advertisement March 17, 1998), the companies expect to
limit class action lawsuits and future punitive damages awards in return
for mega billion settlements.  They also agree voluntarily to restrict
advertising to young people which, absent agreement, could be defended on
First Amendment grounds.
	It is by no means clear at this reading what legislation, if any,
will emerge.  What is clear, however, is who the political winners are.
The republicans who initially labeled (via Newt 
Gingrich) David Kessler a "thug" and "bully" are now ceding to Drs.
Kessler and Koop virtual veto power  over the impending legislation. (6) 
It
is clear also who the enemy is.  Even with all their PAC money, the NY
Times had this to say about the tobacco industry: "Now the tobacco
industry has little more support in Congress than the Mafia and being on
the wrong side of the smoking issue would be like being on the wrong side
of the Communism." (7) For an industry that long held Congress at bay, if
not enthralled, this is a stunning ending to its era of political
influence.  
<p>
<center>
<b>The Lessons for Leadership--Creation of a Secular Morality</b>
</center>
<p>

	The tobacco experience in American society is uniquely positioned
to demonstrate lessons in leadership.  The movement against tobacco use
has largely been inspired by private individuals and groups, with
government playing, until recently, a largely reactive role. (8)
Initially, the main opponents were morally and religiously connected, the
WCTU being a prime example.  Opposition to this approach came largely from
smokers who reflected our libertarian traditions of freedom and tolerance.
Morality alone was clearly not sufficient to ban tobacco any more than it
was able to ban liquor (the Prohibition era stands as testimony there).
<p>

	But when the morality issue became connected to public health, the
stakes changed.  Solomon Katz refers to "the secular morality" movement as
one which turned the tide on tobacco.  For Katz "the secular moral code,
expressed in the context of health" speaks in terms of the traditional
Judea-Christian ethic, but relies on "proscriptive behaviors associated
with the health and fitness movement." (Katz, p. 298).  Thus one would
expect not only tobacco but environmental issues such as global warming,
clean air, etc., to also draw strength from this new morality. <p>

	The concept is keyed to a public knowledge of risk, demonstrated
through the science of epidemiology.  The more the public can be made
aware of "objective" health factors in their lives, the more rational and
compelling is the possibility of reform.  The tobacco story changed
dramatically after the 1964 Surgeon General's report for this reason.
Secular morality relies for its text upon scientific studies and this
invites new leaders to emerge, even if they are not seeking the limelight.
<p>

	The leaders in the tobacco story began with private groups like
the WCTU, but soon give way to scientists like Dr. Alton Ochsner and
Luther Terry, who were supported both by government and groups like the
American Cancer Society  Today groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
Kids (under the leadership of Bill Novelli) have picked up the scientific
and demographic case for tobacco regulation. <p>

	Clearly, however, the key individuals have been Everett Koop and
David Kessler, who as medical doctors have combined personal commitment
with scientific credibility to seize the high ground.  Their current
status as veto holders in the tobacco legislation is a function of this
scientific and moral stature.  In their case, knowledge is power and this
is likely to be the case with others in the future.  Both individuals are
intense, single-minded and seemingly unshakable in their resolve. At times
they may appear arrogant if not obsessed, but their mission orientation
inspires support.   They define a new kind of leader, armed with
information as well as zeal, who can emerge from the shadows or
laboratories to galvanize public action.
	Other leaders of note include (surprisingly) lawyers, some of whom
are not well-known.  Surely law professors like John Banzhaf and Richard
Daynard deserve much credit for they fought against a largely reluctant
political and regulatory process early on.  Their efforts are worthy, yet
they seem to have been substantially ignored in terms of credit for
"scholarly achievement" by the legal academic community.  (Perhaps we have
our own re-balancing of purpose and mission to do here.)  Certainly
members of the plaintiffs' bar who took on tobacco with their own funds
and state attorney generals' (like Mike Moore of Mississippi) deserve
mention for good lawyering as well.  In this case self-interest in the
form of large or even astronomical legal fees need not be inconsistent
with the public interest. <p>

	As far as political figures go, the Clinton/Gore team deserves
credit for embracing the issue when many preferred for it to go away.
Presidential leadership surely made a difference in the tobacco story.
Indeed, Clinton's victory is that tobacco regulation no longer remains an
issue with which his opponents are willing to disagree. <p>

<center>
<b>
The Lessons that Remain -- Moral and Otherwise<p>
</b>
</center>
	Tobacco regulation is a fascinating study of the limits as well as
powers of the political process. Since there are still 47 million smokers
in the United States (and use is picking up among children and women)  (9)
this is not a problem with an obvious solution.  To ban tobacco would not
only interfere with freedom of choice but would be pointless.  The social
costs of creating another illegal market (like drugs) are incalculable.
We currently have a drug enforcement policy that manages the fate of some
15 illegal users, adding 40 plus million more would hardly improve respect
for law.   Yet failure to ban a product that kills over 400,000 Americans
a year clearly has a cynical side.  It is, after all, tobacco taxes
leveled on smokers that will be used to fight the problem.  And if they
are raised too high, a black market will result just as if tobacco had
been banned. (10)  Calibrating the level of a product tax to yield
sufficient revenue without creating an impossible regulatory enforcement
burden is a delicate task indeed. <p>

	And once we conclude that tobacco is a killer, how can we justify
its production abroad?  Do we have a responsibility not to produce a
deadly product?  Perhaps our thriving arms export business provides an
unsettling rebuttal.  Over time these issues are bound to raise more
public policy considerations that will require more good leaders to
resolve.  A lesson of tobacco is that for a long time government got it
wrong.  Without a vital scientific community we would be far from where we
are today.  As risk regulation becomes the rule in our society,  (11) we
are going to be making more and more choices for each other.  From this
perspective, the idea of secular morality appears to have a bright future.
<p>

	Let me add a concluding comment on the whole idea of secular
morality.  Michael Schudson's memorandum of January 8, 1998 set out some
questions for our case studies to consider which I have tried to address
in this paper.  Michael suggests that leadership operates in a climate of
distrust. Certainly the story of how tobacco avoided regulatory control
for many years suggests that there could be a distrust of government
process.  However, since we are dealing with a product that once was used
by over half the adults in America, it was not always unclear which way
the "public" would have wanted the regulatory pressure to go. (Who would
have wanted to deny G.I.s their battlefield ration of Camels or Luckys?)
Today, however, it seems clearer that health based leadership is being
embraced by the public (putting aside whether children are ignoring the
message). <p>

	One use of secular morality is to fight the climate of distrust.
If public policy positions are taken on the basis of scientific studies
rather than purely personal moral codes, it may well produce more
confidence in the basis for public decisionmaking and reduce the level of
distrust. <p>

	As to the importance of leadership, the tobacco story gives a
powerfully positive answer.  Leadership in this context benefitted from
communication to the degree that contrary arguments were simply driven out
by scientific findings.  Even if the public is suspicious generally of
leaders (Michael's hypothesis), leaders like Koop and Kessler dispel that
conclusion in the tobacco context.  Indeed even the President looks good
in this context. (12)

(3) It is important to distinguish the executive branch (and its

airlines initiated by the Civil Acronarcotic Board and tobacco growers won

(8)  It should not be forgotten that states had in earlier times regulated

could hardly be expected to control a product that has interstate
characteristics.
