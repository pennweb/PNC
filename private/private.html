<h3>
The private working space is a passworded, secure environment<p> 
for commission members to read and review documents, comment <p>
on each other's work and ideas in a safe and protected way, <p>
and generally sustain the frank, lively, and  substantive <p>
conversation begun at the commission's first meeting in December.<p> </h3>
