Welcome to the Penn National Commission on Society, Culture and Community.
The Penn National Commission seeks to foster the "reasoned and reasonable" 
discourse essential to the social, political, cultural, and community life
of a democracy. An international group of forty-eight scholars, political
leaders, and shapers of public opinion, convened by University of 
Pennsylvania President Judith Rodin, the Commission is meeting over a 
three-year period to understand the problems of contemporary public
discussion and behavior and foster a more engaged and thoughtful public
discourse in the 21st century.
