<br>
The June 1997 plenary meeting of the Penn National Commission on Society,
Culture
and Community built upon the <a href=pubagendadec96.html>first
meeting</a> 
of December, 1996
by focusing on the
impacts of market and state forces on the dynamics and content of public
culture.  
<p>
Our keynote speaker was Kevin Phillips, editor and publisher
of <u>The American Political Report</u>, columnist for the <i>L.A.
Times,</i> and author
of <u> The Politics of Rich and Poor, The Emerging Republican
Majority</u>,
and
most recently, <u>Arrogant Capital:  Washington, Wall Street, and the
Frustration of American Politics</U>.  
<p>
The commission examined three "hot-button"
issues (affirmative action, campaign reform, and immigration) that
exemplify the impact of these forces on three areas of concern that
emerged
most clearly from the December meeting:  the Culture of Intolerance,
the Failure of Leadership, and the Fragmentation of Communities.   


<p>These
sessions were led by
<ul>
<li><a
href=http://www.law.harvard.edu/Academic_Affairs/Faculty_Directory/e.html>
Christopher
Edley, Jr.,</a> of the Harvard Law School
and author, most recently, of <u>Not All Black and White: Affirmative
Action
and American Values</u>, who led the Clinton administration's review of
affirmative action. <p>

<li>Paul Taylor, who left his editorship at the
<i>Washington Post </i>  during the 1996 campaign to create the campaign
reform
organization Free Time for Straight Talk.  

<p>

<li><a href=http://web-cr01.pbs.org/newshour/ww/rodriguez.html>Richard
Rodriguez,</a> the noted author of <u>Hunger of Memory</u> and

<u>Days of Obligation: An Argument with My Mexican Father</u></a>
and commentator for <i>The News Hour on PBS,</i>
<u>Harpers</u>, the <i>
L.A. Times,</i>  and <u>U.S. News</u>.
</ul>


These presentations and subsequent plenary
discussions set the stage for the initial meetings of three
Commission working groups in the areas of behavior, leadership, and
community.
