Celebrating The Conversation:  Public Discourse in Action Tape 1,
Session 1
<p>
Dr. JUDITH RODIN:  OK.  Why don't we get started.  Good morning
everyone.  I am delighted to welcome you.  Many of you, welcome back.
And to some who are new guests and participants in this sixth and
final plenary meeting of the Penn National Commission.  We're
delighted to have you here.
<p>
I apologize for the enormous amount of material that was sent out to
you and hope that you will see it by way of background.  The readings,
of course, were very useful for--to--for the meeting today and
tomorrow and I hope that you did have a chance to look at them.  The
others were for your background reading.  What we've done is put into
your materials in your blue notebook one-page summaries of the
research findings and of implications that are taken from the--the
larger set of materials that--that you have.  I often think that in
academics we assume that the weight of the output is correlated with
the event--the outcome itself and I know that that's not the case.
<p>
Let me say a word also by way of introduction about the two new Penn
constructions in which you have been.  The Inn at Penn which just
opened in September, which I hope is--is pleasing to you, right next
to a very large bookstore, that I hope you'll have a chance to visit
during your time here.  And then this building, Irvine Auditorium,
which has just been reopened and you may have been tripping over some
of the construction, depending on how you came, and has been
completely restored.  And I hope you'll look in the main hall while
you're here because it--it's really quite wonderful and we're thrilled
at the--at the renovation and, in this case, the restoration.  I only
mention that not to celebrate that Penn, like other institutions,
is--is spending money reviving itself and building new construction,
but to tell you that we are doing it in a way that continues our
intentional strategic commitment toward civic engagement and that all
of the new construction at the university has, as it intent, not only
to build new buildings or restore wonderful old buildings, but to
build economic capacity within our community.  And so our projects
have almost 50 percent women and minority-owned subcontractors.
<p>
We have regulations that all of our tradespeople have to have a
certain number of people from the local west Philadelphia community
working on the projects in order to get the work from the university.
We've used our Wharton entrepreneurship program to start new
businesses among our west Philadelphia neighbors.  We're working with
a very extensive welfare-to-work program as part of our construction
projects.  And it follows, in a way, very strongly from the work that
we are doing on the commission, the notion that a civically engaged
university is a university that builds community with its community in
a way that develops capacity and infrastructure and hope for the
future and we are very, very committed to that as an outcome.
<p>
I'm going not to review what we've done over the last three years.
Indeed, I--I have asked Steve Steinberg to do that with us at lunch
and we'll have some time at our lunch conversation to look back on
what we've accomplished and what we've learned.  But this meeting
marks a transition to another phase of the project of which the
commission is a part.  We've been discussing the various aspects of
community, how communities arise, how discourse within communities has
the--plays a role in either positively or negatively transforming the
way that communities operate and, importantly, the way that a civil
society operates and sees itself.
<p>
We have come, I think, very significantly over this time to begin to
be more interested in the positive mechanisms for community building
than--and learning examples and constructing our own through discourse
leadership, through community initiatives, a variety of sorts then we
have been to focus on our original proposition which was that
incivility was problematic for a civically engaged society.
<p>
It's interesting.  I--I was thinking about Richard Lapchick's
presentation to us and--and the time in which we focused on--and--and
my own first presentation, which we focused on Roberto Alomar and
Latrell Sprewell.  And I think since then we've also seen Sammy Sosa
and Mark McGwire and--and most recently, although only celebrated for
it in death, Walter Payton, but very clear examples in the sports area
and in others that there are so many positive mottoes as well and it's
heartening to see that and to focus on them.
<p>
It's the picture of possibilities and opportunities that in some way
explains the transition that we begin today.  As we've listened
and--and distilled your insights over the last three years into a
coherent vision of contemporary life and--and contemporary discourse
and community-building, our eye has really been focused also on what
we could do that would be transformative.  We all agreed initially
that we would not write a single report at the end and that would be
the commission's product.  I worry that we interpreted that to mean
that we would write thousands of reports and that would be the
commission's product.  But, hopefully, the thousands of reports alone
will not be, and--and after three years of talking in part about
what's wrong with public conduct in culture, about the failures of
leadership, and the fragmentation of our communities, that we really
can, as we've all been gearing to do--and pockets of suggestions
arising in all of our conversations--talking about the exciting
possibilities for improvement.  And each of the sessions during this
meeting focuses on that task, which is:  How do we make better things
happen?  What existing programs and practices can we build on?  What
kinds of changes in leadership and institutional conduct are really
possible?
<p>
Many members of--of the commission have deep theoretical
understandings of democracy and community-building, institutional
leadership and discourse.  Only a few of us, I would say, are really
deeply experienced in the contemporary practices of politics or
entertainment or--or innovative programs within communities and that's
why widening the conversation at this meeting is so important.
<p>
And I want to say a special word of welcome to our presenters and
guest participants.  We think that your presence and participation at
this point in the committee's work is crucial to the next phase and we
have much to learn from your experience.  We need to learn more about
what really works in the trenches of public discourse:  What can and
what cannot be changed and improved?  What are the concrete steps that
will make better things happen?  So this morning, we've asked film
critic and author Neal Gabler to examine the ways in which films and
entertainment shape, limit and especially expand our vision in public
culture in--in a variety of ways.  Then Larry Lessing will lead us in
our long-awaited, long-anticipated exploration of possibilities for
new forms of community and--and productive interaction and discourse
in cyberspace.  We then have the InterAct Theater Company, a local
company that's received much national acclaim, to demonstrate specific
techniques and work with us and work us through those techniques that
they're actually using to break down barriers to dialogue and helping
groups and individuals communicate across boundaries of difference.
<p>
Moving from those sessions, this evening and tomorrow morning, we have
an extraordinary gathering of experts in the practice and study of
political discourse, in particular, that will help us the exam--to
examine the possibilities for making one of our most important
national conversations more engaged, more productive, more welcome,
frankly, into the homes of our citizens.  This evening, Ed Rendell,
who is the mayor of Philadelphia and the new chairman of the
Democratic National Party, will join us.  Tomorrow morning, we have
commission members Karl Rove, Tom Luce and Kathleen Jamieson.
Join--joining us, former commission member Paul Begala for this
important and--and, I think, quite unique conversation.
<p>
And finally, we'll have a chance under the leadership of Jay Rosen to
learn more about the actual practices of--of promoting public
discourse and good public discourse, having invited several of the
leaders of the most compelling community-building groups that came
from David Rife's latest research and--and analysis.  So this is a
meeting in which we turn our gaze--our--our gaze to the concrete
possibilities engendered by our work, and we are very much looking
forward to that.
<p>
With so many new guests and participants and with many--a
cyberaudience we have lis--listening and--and looking in, I just want
to say one additional word, and that is that our--our focus has been
not only on what the Penn National Commission can do or even what
a--our institutions and programs and leaders can do.  But I think
we've all focused on this as also an effort to ask what we as
individuals can do.  And--and there's been a very personal commitment
on the part of the members of this commission to take individual
leadership and individual responsibility for broadening this set of
debates and for, really, arriving at not only an understanding, but an
individual set of--of commitments to how to enhance community,
re-engage the polity and expand our civil doc--discourse, civil
dialogue and national sense of community as we move forward.  And I
think if--if each of us views this as--as a personal commitment, that
so much more can be accomplished, and I look forward to that.
<p>
I'd like to begin the first session--and, unfortunately, Rochelle
Gurstein, who was to have introduced our first speaker, came down with
the flu last night and called and won't be able to join us.  So, Neal,
I'll take on that welcomed task.  One of the most difficult aspects of
the issues we've examined is the overwhelming influence of popular
culture, and we thought the overwhelming influence of mass marketing
of--of entertainment and culture, both on the substance and the
perceptions of public discourse.  So as we look ahead to ask ourselves
what we can do to improve the situation, it's especially important to
see how film now characterizes whether it is contributing to or merely
reflecting major transformations in how community and discourse are
characterized and how our culture really has been engaged.
<p>
Neal is going to help us imagine how the power of cinema might be
turned into an asset in the creation of a more robust and productive
polity and--and set of discourse communities.  Neal is one of the most
thoughtful commentators on public culture and mass entertainment.
Indeed, he's been described in articles about him as one of America's
most important public intellectuals.  A former academic--although no
one is ever a former academic--recipient of Guggenheim and Freedom
Forum fellowships, Neal Gabler taught at the University of Michigan
and Pennsylvania State University before turning full-time to movie
criticism and writing.  A serious student on the culture of celebrity,
he's written books on Walter Winchell--that book was nominated for a
National Book Critics Circle Award in 1994--a book on the creation of
Hollywood, and he's currently at work on a biography of Walt Disney.
His most recent book--and we had a--a piece from it in your
materials--captured--captures in its very title perhaps the essence of
the problem that we confront.  It's called "Life the Movie."
<p>
So for all of us who have wondered whether we're becoming characters
in some kind of all-encompassing "Truman Show," it's my pleasure to
welcome Neal Gabler on behalf of the Penn National Commission.
<p>
Mr. NEAL GABLER (Author, "Life the Movie"):  Thank you very much.
<p>
I'm a little intimidated facing this distinguished group of scholars
and educators from whom, I have to admit, I've learned a great deal in
my life.  And I thought I might just start by giving back to you some
of the things that we've learned from the movies.  A friend of mine
recently sent me a list of lessons that we have learned from the
movies.  And I thought before we knuckle down to serious business, I
want to share a few of these with you.
<p>
At least one pair of identical twins is born evil.
<p>
Should you decide to defuse a bomb, don't worry which wire to cut, you
will always choose the right one.
<p>
It does not matter if you're heavily outnumbered in a fight involving
martial arts.  Your enemies will wait patiently to attack you, one by
one, by dancing around in a threatening manner until you've knocked
out their predecessors.
<p>
Honest and hard-working policemen are traditionally gunned down three
days before their retirement.
<p>
Rather than wasting bullets, megalomaniacs prefer to kill their
archenemies using complicated machinery involving fuses, pulley
systems, deadly gases, lasers, man-eating sharks, which will allow
their captives at least 20 minutes to escape.
<p>
During all police investigations, it will be necessary to visit a
strip club at least once.
<p>
It's easy for anyone to land a plane, providing there is someone in
the control tower to talk you down.
<p>
You're very likely to survive any battle in any war, unless you make
the mistake of showing someone a picture of your sweetheart back home.
<p>
Should you wis to--wish to pass yourself off as a German or Russian
officer, it will not be necessary to speak the language.  A German or
Russian accent will do.
<p>
The Eiffel Tower can be seen from any window in Paris.
<p>
A man will show no pain while taking the most ferocious beating, but
will wince when a woman tries to clean his wounds.
<p>
If staying in a haunted house, women should investigate any strange
noises in their most revealing underwear.
<p>
All bombs are fitted with electronic timing devices with large red
readouts so that you know exactly when they're going off.
<p>
Police departments give their officers personality tests to make sure
that they are deliberately assigned a partner who is their total
opposite.
<p>
And finally, when they're alone, all foreign milis--military officers
prefer to speak to each other in English.
<p>
Now I've been invited here this morning to discuss how the movies have
portrayed public discourse, and how that portrayal may affect our
public discourse.  But before I delve into those matters, I think it's
important to recognize that the movies themselves are a form of public
discourse.  Most obviously and narrowly, the movies have addressed a
range of subjects from sexual behavior to race to war to social
responsibility to juvenile delinquency to such other pressing issues
as fending off an alien horde bent on conquering the Earth or
destroying humongous monsters trampling through our cities and
overturning our public transportation systems, or deflecting asteroids
headed directly toward our planet.
<p>
There is, however, another less obvious and more generalized way in
which the movies have become a form of discourse.  This one having
less to do with a specific content of any single film than with the
act of moviegoing itself.  Almost from the inception of the movies
late in this--in the last century, moviegoing has constituted a
cultural declaration in the national conversation.  Ordinary citizens
flocked to the movies, recognizing that here was a medium that
belonged to them.  And not only because it was accessible and
relatively inexpensive, it belonged to them because there were none of
the cultural pretensions and prohibitions that attached to so many
other arts, and none of the cultural condescension, either.  You could
chat at the movies.  You could neck at the movies--you still can.  You
can eat at the movies.  And the vestiges of these activities remain,
to this day, in what I have described as `the Whitmanian slurp of soda
and the crunch of popcorn.' Now just think of it.  Imagine going to
the opera or to the symphony or to the ballet lugging your box or bag
of popcorn, and you'll see what I mean.  You just don't do it.  In a
way, even eating and drinking is a cultural declaration.
<p>
In a sense, moviegoing has always been a slightly subversive activity.
Subverting the elitist idea of what art is supposed to be, which is
why elitists condemn the movies on aesthetic grounds and why moralists
condemn them and continue to condemn them on moral grounds.  To this
day, conservatives cannot countenance the fact that having
commandeered the country's political agenda, they have not been able
to commandeer its cultural agenda.
<p>
And I got an example of this as I was flying in on the plane.  I was
thumbing through a Newsweek magazine, and I came across this little
note by George Will, which I scribbled hastily and I will try to read
to you now.  In athletics, the legs may be the first thing to go, but
in academics, the eyes are the first thing to go.  Will is writing not
about the movies here, but about another facet of popular culture,
Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead.  And he says, `Jerry Garcia and
the Grateful Dead cannot be held accountable for the character of all
their fans.  But he and the band were pleased to be thought of as
keepers of the flame of the '60s.  The band's music may have been
grand, but the band has promoted much more than music.  Around it has
hung an aroma of disdain for inhibitions on recreational uses of drugs
and sex.  During the band's nearly 30-year life, the costs of
liberation from such inhibitions have been made manifest in the
millions of shattered lives and the miles of devastated cities.'
<p>
And I might add that one could have written--written and read
virtually the same thing about the movies earlier in this century.
<p>
Frankly, what I think George Will and those who criticize popular
culture don't understand is that there may actually be a cause and
effect relationship between their caterwauling about the debased state
of American popular culture and the embrace of that culture by the
general populace.  Because they fail to recognize this nose-thumbing,
contrarian, Democratic impulse that moviegoing exercises, especially
among the young, which is why there are still 20 million people who go
to the movies on a weekly basis.
<p>
Perhaps the single-most intense pleasure of moviegoing,' the critic
Pauline Kale once wrote, `is this non-aesthetic one, of escaping from
the responsibilities of having the proper responses required of us in
our official school culture.  It's the feeling of freedom from
respectability we have always enjoyed at the movies.'
<p>
And if the conservatives fail to recognize the cause and effect
relationship between their disapproval and public approval, they also
fail to recognize another cause and effect relationship, I think, one
between the sense that our political system is unresponsive to public
needs and the feeling that the popular culture is responsive.  The
sense of disempowerment in one arena becomes a sense of empowerment in
the other.
<p>
Critics may say, and they say this constantly, that Hollywood is
governed by a liberal media elite that doesn't give the public what it
wants.  But no one can make the argument, I believe, that Hollywood
isn't trying to give the public what it wants.  That's what Hollywood
exists for.  All of which is to say that whether one likes them or
not, the movies are Jacksonian.  They are expression of public will
against all the forces that seem to disregard us.
<p>
And, in fact, we just got an example recently.  If you've been
following this publicity about the film "Omega Code"--"Omega Code" is
a film that was financed by the fundamentalist Christian right, and
it's an adventure movie, and it's been heavily promoted in
fundamentalist pulpits across the country as an alternative to
Hollywood's fare, thus giving those people who allegedly are put off
by what Hollywood provides some option.  And in point of fact,
we--we--if you've been reading this story in the entertainment
press--I mean, the film has made $2 million in--in--in grosses.  And
this is something that the fundamentalist right has--has boasted
about.  But anyone who knows about tallying grosses in Hollywood knows
that $2 million doesn't even make you a blip on the Hollywood radar
screen.  In a sense, they're trying to make something
non-transgressive for a very transgressive form.
<p>
Now when you move to the matter of how the movies have portrayed
public discourse, you immediately discover something:  They don't.
There's very little public discourse in American film.  And I suppose
that shouldn't be too surprising.  The movies, after all, are a
kinetic medium, a medium of action.  Discourse, particularly rational
discourse, isn't exactly going to provide nail-biting suspense.
Watching public discussion is much more likely to be like watching
paint dry.
<p>
Still, I selected a few examples of how Hollywood has presented public
discussion on screen.  The first is from Frank Capra's classic, "Mr.
Smith Goes To Washington," which is about how idealism can survive in
a system of corruption.  The scene here--and I'm assuming you've
probably all seen this film, if not recently, but at some point in
your life--is of naive Senator Jefferson Smith, played by Jimmy
Stewart, chosen by the political machine, because he was seen as
malleable, now waging a filibuster against the forces of evil.
<p>
(Excerpt from "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington")
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  I don't know about you, but I think it's still
effective.
<p>
The next scene I've selected is from "Field of Dreams," which is, as
you undoubtedly know, about a young Iowa farmer who suddenly is
inspired to build a baseball field.  But this scene is not about the
baseball field, it's a public meeting in the school gymnasium about
censorship.
<p>
(Excerpt from "Field of Dreams")
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  My last scene is more recent.  It's from Warren Beatty's
"Bulworth." Here, Senator Bulworth, having suffered a nervous
breakdown during his campaign, decides that he's going to tell the
truth, rather than dispense the typical political bromides.
<p>
(Excerpt from "Bulworth")
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Now you may notice something from these clips.  In the
first place, they present issues as a matter of conflict rather than
of conflict resolution.  Each assumes that there is a truth, and that
truth is thwarted by forces of ignorance, as in "Field of Dreams," or
outright corruption and greed.  For truth to triumph then, one has to
defeat the forces of ignorance or greed.  In the second place, one
might also notice that the airing of public issues is really less a
matter of discussion or negotiation than of individual action.  People
don't band together to accomplish their ends in American films.
That's what happens in the old Soviet movies of Eisenstein.  In
American movies, people may be inspired to act, but the inspiration is
almost always an individual, a hero.  In fact, I believe that that may
be the real subtext of virtually every commercial American film.
<p>
We are constantly being reminded, subliminally and otherwise, of the
importance of being important.  Whether it is the emphasis on the star
above the title or the compositions that invariably favor the heroic
figure, as you saw here, or the narratives that are driven by the
hero's actions, we are being told that not to be at the center of
action is to be swept to the margins.
<p>
Schwarzenegger may kill dozens of bad guys in one of his films, but no
one cares about them.  I don't think that anyone, myself included,
sits and thinks, `Does this fellow have a wife?  Does this fellow have
children?  Does this fellow have a mother and father?' No, we don't
care about them because we realize that they're there as fodder.  They
don't matter.  The only one who matters is Schwarzenegger himself.
<p>
I think most of us are aware that a good deal of our public discourse
has been shaped in the image of the movies, and specifically, in the
image of these two elements, which are so fundamental to our
moviegoing pleasure:  the centrality of conflict and the valorization
of the individual.
<p>
Now let's take the first of these endowments.  When it comes to social
issues, we now tend to think in terms of plots.  It seems that every
issue is resolved into a Manichaean dispute, a battle between good and
bad, which favors drama over fact.  This, of course, isn't an entirely
new phenomenon in the world of public affairs.  Jeffersonians
portrayed America in its infancy as threatened by demonic federalists
who support a essential authority and affected, aristocratic ways.
Jacksonians portrayed Americans threatened by rich, intellectual
dandies, populists by Eastern banking interests and anti-populists by
populists.  Reaganites by free-spending liberals and Clintonites by
political moralists.
<p>
But while political narratives are nothing new, the mass media have
intensified them, I believe, virtually demanding that issues somehow
be configured as plot if they are going to get a public airing since
it is the political drama that the media love, not the dull recitation
of positions and policies.  And that's why Ronald Reagan, in opposing
the Soviet Union, invoked the specter of an evil empire, and scolded
those who wanted to remove themselves from what he called the struggle
between right and wrong and good and evil.  And that's why Arianna
Huffington, in floating the presidential possibilities of actor Warren
Beatty, described his chief political asset as being a master
storyteller, someone who could frame the issues for the public in ways
that will get them to care.  Good, exciting plots like the recent
showdown over the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty on the one
hand, or the showdown over the president's indiscretions with Monica
Lewinsky on the other, are the ones that are most likely to get media
attention for the obvious reason that those are the ones, like the
movies, that are most likely to be entertaining.
<p>
And I might add parenthetically here, that throughout the '80s,
liberals were accused of having no ideas.  When, in fact, what they
lacked were not ideas but good plots of the sort that animated liberal
politics during the Depression when you had economic royalists to
attack.  The conservatives may not have had better ideas, but they did
have better plots.  Citizen politicians whacking away at big
government and the United States facing down the Soviet Union.
<p>
In the process of turning policy debates into movie narratives, these
plots are also more likely to be divorced from the politics they
purport to frame than the old pol--plots which were designed, after
all, not for entertainment value, but to sharpen political
distinctions between opponents and to rally the troops.
<p>
What the media emphasized in the Test Ban Treaty, for example, was not
the substantive points of the treaty.  We got almost none of that in
the political media.  They emphasized the political gamesmanship
between the president and the congressional Republicans.  And even
those of us who listen to NPR got kind of hourly updates on Trent Lott
and Clinton facing down one another.
<p>
And when it comes to electoral politics, we now all take it for
granted that the coverage will consist primarily of telling us who is
ahead and how he might stumble; the so-called horse race aspect.  It
has become so much a part of our politics that every candidate is now
expected to have a personal narrative for the media to retail.  George
W.  Bush is the prodigal son; John McCain, the war hero; Bill Bradley,
the non-political politician.  Only Al Gore seems to have no
narrative, which may be the occupational hazard of being a vice
president.  He's condemned to be a sequel to the president's
narrative.  And I might also add that the press then amends these
plots, almost on a weekly basis.  We had the press amending George
Bush's plot by asking about his cocaine use.  This week, the press is
all in a dither about John McCain's temperament and whether he has a
presidential temperament.  Next week, it will be something else.  But
these are not really points that address his capability to be
president.  They are points that give us a certain amount of
entertainment value.
<p>
The emphasis on the plot has one other consequence besides separating
the dramatic form from its content.  Again, one that I believe is
directly related to the movies.  As anyone who listens to talk radio
can attest, it forces our discourse to extremes, since it's at the
extremes where the greatest drama and the highest entertainment value
lie.  In American policy discussions, whether it's on "Crossfire" or
"Nightline" or "Meet the Press," or simply in a postmortem of a
presidential speech or debate, we always get the pairs.  The yin and
the yang or, less charitably, the mongoose and the snake.  You just
poke them a few times and then you watch them go at it.  And since
this is the way that the media now present policy discussions,
participants understand what is expected of them.  And what is
expected is combat.  But if we tend to think of policy issues in terms
of plot, setting one side against another, we also tend to think of
them in terms of individual action, and that also distorts public
discourse.  Actually, more than distorts it.
<p>
Let me explain.  Robert Dahl, the esteemed political theorist, once
described pluralist democracy as a government in which instead of a
single center of sovereign power, there must be multiple centers of
power, none of which can--would--none of which is or can be wholly
sovereign.  In practice, this means, among other things, what Dahl
called constant negotiations among different centers of power in order
to make decisions.
<p>
Now talk about non-cinematic.  Multiple centers of power?  Constant
negotiations?  Huh-uh.  In the movies, there is one center of power
and there are no negotiations.  Action--anyone who negotiates is a
nerd or a wimp.  In short, pluralist democracy makes for a terrible
plot.  And Americans know it.  They're exasperated by the mess this
form of government inevitably entails.  And they are constantly
searching not for leaders, who swear their fealty to the system, but
for leaders who vow to change it.  And from "Mr. Smith Goes To
Washington" to "Bulworth," we find one unmistakable message:  The
system stinks.
<p>
The basic appeal of H.  Ross Perot, I believe, was his promise that as
a no-nonsense businessman he simply wouldn't tolerate the system's red
tape.  He'd just cut right through it.  And this is also the promise
of punitive candidate Donald Trump, citing his swift construction of
the Wollman Ice Skating Rink in New York Central Park as the paradigm
for his perspective rule.  He says, `You just do it.  That's all.  You
just do it.' Now this isn't political talk.  At least not the talk of
a pluralist democracy.  This is movie talk.  And it taps into one of
the greatest satisfactions of the movies, the vicarious thrill of a
hero overcoming every obstacle, vanquishing every foe.  In effect,
it's a politics of anti-politics, a politics that challenges the very
basis of our democracy by replacing the mess with the all-powerful
hero acting for right and good.
<p>
Now as powerful effect as this is, the movies may have had a more
powerful effect still.  One that is a result not of the movies serving
as a model for public discourse, but of the movies operating as a kind
of consciousness, a way of framing our reality.  We usually think of
policy discussions, at least those in this august company, as being
substantive.  By which I mean that they deal with problems and they
examine how we're going to solve them.  You present possibilities, you
analyze outcomes, you assess political avenues and roadblocks on those
avenues.  But there is an aspect of public policy that has less to do
with solving problems than in making one feel as if the problems don't
matter.  It is the idea, of want for a better term, a feel good.  And
this is important comp--it is an important component, both in the
movies and in governing, especially in this age of mass media where
public officials can communicate to the public directly and often, and
where marshaling public support has been more important than
marshaling party support.
<p>
As the first president to take full advantage of the national media,
Franklin Roosevelt understood the importance of this cheerleading
function.  Even before he devised a strategy of dealing with the
Depression, he was massaging the public psyche, rallying the public
mood, telling people they had nothing to fear but fear itself.  Harry
Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, both--both largely disdained this
responsibility, but John Kennedy understood it, too.  He knew that his
personal glamour would become the national glamour, that his
self-confidence would become the national confidence.  But no one
understood the importance of feel good as instinctively or had as
natural a gift for it as Ronald Reagan, who had, of course, not
incidentally, come to politics from the movies.  Reagan had learned a
great many things from his years in Hollywood, especially about the
art of performance.  But the most important lesson, I believe, that he
learned was that people flocked to the movies because they liked the
way the movies made them feel.  Reagan brought this basic piece of
intelligence to his new profession, recognizing the affinity between
what the movies did and what politics could do if only one reimagined
the form.  In fact, reimagined it as a movie.
<p>
Reagan's revelation was that politics didn't have to be about policy.
It could be about raising spirits.  Now this is not to say that the
actions taken during his administration with his endorsement didn't
affect people's lives.  Obviously, it did--they did.  It is to say
that for Reagan himself and for a good many Americans as well, the
perception of the president as a genial leader made his policies
largely irrelevant to them.  As Donald Trump recently enthused about
Reagan on the Larry King show, where he was announcing his exploration
of his own presidential candidacy, and I think he echoes the
sentiments of a great many Americans in saying this--of Reagan--`He'll
go down in history as a great president.  And not so much for the
things he did.  It's just that there's a demeanor to him and a spirit
that the country had under Reagan that was really phenomenal, and
that's really a big part of being president.  And it certainly is a
big part of being president now.'
<p>
Now this may constitute the other Reagan revolution, one that I
suspect was much closer to his own heart than the conservative
orthodoxy so often attributed to him, and one that may have much more
enduring ramifications for our public discourse.  Reagan turned
politics into a placebo by regarding Americans not as a constituency
to be served, but as an audience to be uplifted.  He recognized that
politics, like the movies, could itself be a form of escapism.  And
that the presidency need not be a bully pulpit to hector, but rather
could be a bully pom-pom to root.  The charm of his presidency,
especially after Carter's fixation on malaise, was that there was
never any malaise.  And I might add here that malaise makes a terrible
plot as well.  Who's the hero when there's malaise?  No.  No malaise.
Instead, it was always morning in Reagan's America.
<p>
Now how did he accomplish this?  He accomplished it by reframing
issues as anecdotes and stories, many of them drawn from the movies
themselves.  I'm sure you've all heard the story that Reagan told
frequently about the young gunner during World War II who was in a
plane--who was shot and the plane was going down and he was frantic,
and an older soul on the plane embraced him and said, `Don't worry,
son, I'm going down with you.' And Reagan always told this, as I'm
sure you know, as if it had actually happened.  When, in point of
fact, it was a scene from "A Wing and a Prayer" in Hollywood.
<p>
He accomplished this by creating cinematic images that were impressed
into our consciousness, like the welfare queen.  Or one that I've
always remembered and that used to tell frequently about the common
man who invented a beer can holder and became a millionaire as a
result.  Or the Star Wars anti-missile system.  And he accomplished
this by borrowing movie dialogue.  There was a story that the New York
Post wanted to headline in the wake of the Achille Lauro seajacking,
they wanted the headline to say:  They Can Run, But They Can't Hide,
the old Joe Louis line about Billy Kahn.  Now Reagan hadn't said this,
so the New York Post contacted Pat Buchanan, who was then the
communications office.  And they said, `We've got this wonderful
headline.' So Buchanan contacted Reagan.  Reagan said, `They can run,
but they can't hide.' It got recycled back and it became the headline
of the New York Post.
<p>
He accomplished this by bringing absolute narrative clarity to any
situation and by making his performance before the cameras, the
measure of his performance in office, something that we now know is
a--a part of our political discourse.  There's a wonderful line that
one of Walter Mondale's advisers said in 1984 during--prepping for the
debates, he said, `We spent more time discussing ties than East-West
relations.' And I have a feeling that's true of anyone now who preps
for a televised debate.
<p>
In effect, for Reagan, as his biographer Lou Cannon has observed--that
is the biographer who really wrote about Reagan, as opposed to the
biographer who wrote about himself--the presidency was a movie and he
was its star.  And if this meant that statecraft was replaced by stage
craft, that presentation superceded policy, I think in Reagan's mind,
it seemed a relatively small price to pay for what you got.  And what
you got was exactly what you got from the movies:  an ineffable sense
of pleasure, a wonderful sense of security.
<p>
And this, I think, may be the most profound effect of the movies on
our public discourse.  Engagement with issues increasingly gets
pre-empted by escapist entertainment, whether it's the entertainment
value of the conflict itself, or the entertainment value of pretending
that the conflict can be easily resolved, or the entertainment value
of being distracted from the conflict altogether.  Whatever the source
of the entertainment, the purpose of the cinematic mode of discourse
isn't to resolve our differences, but to make us feel better about
ourselves, which is not insignificant.  It's important.  But it is not
the same thing as confronting our problems and meeting our challenges
either.
<p>
So the task is sent.  For those who want to encourage discourse, who
want to stimulate a rational exchange of ideas, the challenge is to
usher us from the movie theater into the real world, from the darkness
of wish fulfillment into the light of reason.  Until then, the movie
will just keep on rolling.  Thank you very much.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Thank you so much.  We do have time for questions.  You
take them from here.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Certainly.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Kathleen.
<p>
KATHLEEN:  Now the--I--let me--let me offer you an alternative
explanation of Reagan.  I--I think Aristotle said something very
important when he talked about apodictic and the end of apodictic
being spectatorship, not judgment, and I think that's what you're
tapping into in a very provocative way.  But rather than suggest that
that is not an important function of the civic leader, I would argue
that the kind of state building that happens when you reconstruct your
sense of identity as a citizen in this state, which happens through
narrative forms, largely, is the basis for putting in place the value
assumptions that lets you deliberate.  And that in an environment
which many of those who've been called into question--you know, during
the Carter presidency, some explicitly, some not, in the form of the
so-called malaise speech, that what Reagan managed to understand or
someone understood for Reagan was that he needed a form of discourse
that was able to put in place the value assumptions and reinforce them
to the extent that the country was able to work from something towards
something in the future.  And the piece of evidence I would draw for
that is what I think is one of the finer speeches of the Reagan
legacy, which is the speech at Normandy, in which he's rehearsing the
values of World War II.  Classic apodictic fashion.  He's telling
narratives.  These are the boys that plan to hope, these are the men
who took the cliffs.
<p>
That narrative structure ends with his reading the letter of a young
woman whose father was unable to go back because he's died of cancer,
but she has gone back, and he reads the letter for her.  We're now
reclaiming a sense that the country could, in fact, engage in just war
after Vietnam, which is not an unimportant claim, but the end
statement that Reagan makes in that speech is his promise--her promise
to her father, he translates into, `We must always be prepared, so we
must always be free.' And I think that's a classic move to use what is
a narrative structure in an apodictic context to rebuild the value
premises that then let's him create the basis for an argument about
Star Wars.
<p>
So I would like to suggest an alternative, which is that Reagan did
everything that you suggested, but that the end was more noble than I
think you end--end with.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Well, I--I mean, I--I--I agree with you and I didn't
mean to--to impute that there was a lack of nobility here.  Neil
Postman, in his new book, talks about we need narratives not because
they give us truth, but because they give us meaning.  And--and I
think that is absolutely true.  I was--I've been reading John Dower's
book called "Embracing Defeat" about the--the occupation of Japan.
And he talks about how important it is in--in Japan, in the post-war
period, for them to build new narratives that will give their lives
meaning, and I believe that's true.  But I don't think it's an
either/or proposition.  And--and I think what we need is we need
narratives, clearly, to give us a sense of meaning and direction.  But
we also need engagement with policy so that those narratives get down
to the trenches, to use the word you were talking about earlier.  And
I think that's--unfortunately, the first tends to negate the second,
rather than work in tandem with the second.  But I--I think your--your
point is--is well-taken.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Martin.
<p>
MARTIN:  And--and let me suggest that there's something deeper than
hero and individual in the scenes you showed and in what's appealing
here.  I--I think the deeper thing is that there--there are zero sum
games, there's winners and losers.  And I bel--I believe you've
described the past, not the future of both the movies and of
discourse.  Let me say why.  I--I think when nations are poor, at war,
in famine, in desperation, that it's perfectly natural that the
entertainments and even the sciences they turn to are about zero sum
games, about winning and losing, about damage, about healing, about
repair of damage.  But I think when nations are in surplus and not at
war, the people--what counts as entertainment--turn to a different
vision, and that's the--roughly the non-zero sum game, in which
something new is created out of the conflict, in which both sides win,
which there isn't a good and evil side.  And it--it's interesting that
you showed a--"Field of Dreams." I mean, that's a great entertainment,
but that is a non-zero sum game movie.  That's a build it--there's no
winner and no loser in "Field of Dreams." That's build it and they
will come.
<p>
So I want--I want to suggest that part of the challenge for discourse
and for entertainment is to create movies, to create dialogue that's
about non-zero sum games, that there are heros of those things and
there are individuals of those things.  And unlike the emotions that
are produced by the zero sum game movies, which I think are relief and
love and hate, the emotions that are produced when you see a non-zero
sum game, I think are--get back to what Kathleen was talking about,
they're in the class of awe.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  I--I wish I could be, you know, as optimistic as you
are, that that's going to happen, but I don't believe it will.  I
believe that there is something fundamental in the attraction of those
individuals on screen whom we've always valorized.  And we valorize
them because they can do things that we as individuals can't do.  And
I don't see that the--that the themes of our films are changing in
that respect.  In point of fact, I think there's a--there's real
continuity there of between a matrix and, you know, movies of the
'30s, for that matter.  I just think that this is something
fundamental.  It's a fundamental identification.  And I don't believe
that that's going to change.  I think there will be other movies made
in other ways by other people, and there is growing a whole
independent film movement.  Now what I'm talking about here, and I was
careful to talk about commercial American films and Hollywood films,
because I think they have a different orientation than independent
films.  But in Hollywood, I think that this is going to be the--the
theme and this is going to be the matrix.
<p>
MARTIN:  I--I think it's fundamental when the audience is in
desperation.  I think you're right about that.  But I think when the
audience is not desperate, they're looking for a larger vision.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  But I--I think you also have to understand that the
audience for these movies, you know, skews very young.  Hollywood
skews very young.  And--although the audience is aging now, as the
baby boomers age, you know, there's--there is that transgressive
aspect of movies.  And what you're addressing is a non-transgressive,
a healing, kind of discourse.  But as--as the--as the father of two
teen-agers, I can tell you, that that's the last thing they want to go
to the movies to see.  I mean, what they want to see is transgression,
and, hopefully, it stays on the screen.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Michael.
<p>
MICHAEL:  Well, I--I don't know what to make of what you said, because
it seems to me that--I'm quite sure that we passed through a real
substantive revolution in America--not just political thought, but the
way we understand the world and--and--and the way we think about
policy in the 1980s.  And I find it difficult to separate out that
revolution from--from Reagan.  So whereas I don't doubt and--and I can
see in--in--in my own experience of Reagan, a reflection of the points
you're making about the movies and Reagan's conception of the
presidency in terms of the--of--of--of the movies.  I--I just can't
see that as--I--I--it seems to me that just doesn't do justice to what
happened during the Reag--Reagan--Reagan years.  And so I--I guess
what--I--it seems to me--are there two processes going on?  Is one
unrelated to the other?  Are you really arguing that Reagan had
nothing to do with a complete sea change?
<p>
I mean, I speak--that is, I did live through the '60s, and I stand in
front of my classes today of students who fi--I mean, it's--it's
amazing to get them to discuss what they think the '60s was about.
And you could also--it's an exercise which is very similar to getting
them to discuss what the Depression was about.  But the way they think
about the world, the way they think about policy, indeed, the way I
think about policy has nothing to do, really, with the way we thought
about it going in to the--to the Reagan--Reagan administration.
<p>
So i--what your presentation raises for me is this question of if--if
Reagan operated in--in--in--in the movies, how did he accomplish such
a fundamental change in the substantive debates which we have about
policy in the United States today?
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  I think that's a good question, and--and
le--you--you--you mentioned earlier that--is there--is there two
processes going on?  One thing that I think this audience may not be,
you know, as attuned to because you are so deep into policy
discussion--and I live in a small community where nobody really cares
about policy discussions, except if they read them in the newspapers
or--or see them on television--is that there is the debate that goes
on within government and among individuals in this room, which is, you
know, always going to be substantive debate.  And there's the way the
discourse is framed out there, in the media and for ordinary people,
the vast, you know, majority of the citizenry.  I think those are two
different processes.  I think there are two different things going on.
I would never say--and I didn't say, you know, in my remarks--that the
Reagan presidency was non-substantive.  That's not--clearly, I mean,
that's a foolish--you know, it would be an idiotic remark to make.
<p>
What I'm saying is that he changed discourse, and that that discourse
now can be detached from substance.  It's--it's almost in a way
free-floating.  And we see the way that the media frame events.
Again, I--I go back to the Comprehensive, you know, Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty.  Now where in the public, among ordinary citizens, was there a
discussion--we know that the poll said something like 80 percent of
the people supported the treaty, but where was the discussion of the
treaty?  I read newspapers.  I read magazines.  I listened to the
radio.  As I said, I w--as I said earlier, I was listening to NPR on a
regular basis.  And what I heard was, you know, `The president and
Trent Lott are--you know, they don't want to meet one another or maybe
they will meet one another or the Democrats have--have dug themselves
a hole on this one and Trent Lott'--now that's a way of framing a
policy issue.  And I would submit that it's a way that we frame a good
many of our policy issues now.
<p>
To get back to what Mr. Segman was saying, it's winners and losers.
It's who's on top and who isn't.  It's not the substance of the
policy.  And--and I--do I think that Reagan, you know, made this sea
change, you know, by himself?  No.  Obviously not.  I think there have
been many periods in American history where policy discussions have
not been, you know, substantive, necessarily, but have been about the
conflict.  But I think that this is an ongoing process, and I think he
certainly accelerated it.  So I wouldn't sa--I think there are
two--two processes going on.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Leon, you were next.
<p>
LEON:  I'm--kept thinking back to the McCarthy-Army hearings.  And the
book that Samuel Stouffer wrote on that based on public opinion
surveys of citiz--a cross section of national citizens.  And among the
findings he came up with are consistent with your interpretations,
namely that there was two titans battling each other and the main
interest was winning and losing.  Who's going to win this?  There was
an entertainment value to it, and it was like a baseball game and
s--and so on.  And you could, at that point, say Army-McCarthy
hearings as movie.  But in the probes, there were terms of winning and
losing, criteria of who would win or lose.  They were not exactly
correlated with the people's attitudes toward communism or civil
liberties, but they were--they were linked very closely as to how the
combatants behaved.  So that it was extremely important that McCarthy
blew it.  And it was extremely important that he didn't behave
according to certain rules; that--that these were of the--the terms of
winning and losing and it wasn't just these two people fighting as an
outcome.  That there were some talk about democracy going on and talk
about discourse and talk about procedures going on, so that there are
these different levels.  You might say they didn't get down to the--is
McCarthy wrong on communism or right on com--that one wasn't so much
in their minds as to what was going on in this political struggle, so
that was a kind of multiple levels rather than a--than a--a simple
movie.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  I--I think that's a--that's a good point.  And--and--I
mean, what you're really saying is that he didn't behave heroically.
And that that was something that people responded to at--at
some--either some overt level or some subliminal level.  I mean, I
always thought of--of--you know, watching the old kinescopes of the
Army-McCarthy hearings.  What would have happened if he did behave
heroically?  What would have happened if instead of Roy Cohn looking
the way he looked, which was the very personification of evil, whether
he was or not--I'm saying how he looked on screen--what if he looked
like John Kennedy?  What if he was handsome and dashing?  What if he
was courtly in his behavior?  What if McCarthy--instead of being, you
know, jowly and--and, you know, angry with that high-pitched voice of
his--what if he had, you know, a deep--what if he acted like Joseph
Welch acted?
<p>
Now one could say that he couldn't do that because there was something
that was bound up.  The value system was bound up in the behavior,
which is, I think, essentially what you're saying, and that may
be--very well be true.  But I always think what--you know, what if the
roles were switched, but not the ideology?  I mean, we can only guess.
I mean, it--we--we don't know.
<p>
Dr. ROSEN:  Jay.
<p>
JAY:  I want to ask you, Neal, about middle grounds between the worlds
that you've sketched out.  Between, let's say, fairy tales on the one
hand and position papers or between--you know, Hollywood on one side
and the Brookings Institution on the other side.  Because, you know,
we often sort of feel that there's two possibilities.  You know, one
is this grand narrative strategy on the one hand, and the other is the
plotting recitation of actualities on--on the other.  And it seems to
me that all the interesting problems lie in the middle.  So what
I--what I wanted to ask you is, who and what forms of discourse, what
genres in the media, what political practitioners seem to you to get
some essential points about narrative and the media on the one hand,
but are trying to accomplish something within public discourse on the
other.  Who in--in the media does this?  H--which is, you know,
neither archetypal mythologies on the one hand or the "NewsHour with
Jim Lehrer" on the other, you know?
<p>
Now in--when you think about that middle ground, President Clinton,
for all his manifold and spectacular flaws, seems to me to be somewhat
in that territory or--or have the idea that one must do that, because
he's amazingly well-informed about issues and will often educate
people about things like the earned-income tax credit, or something
like this, in his public appearances, but he's--also has a gift as
Reag--Reagan did for telling stories and for communicating with
individuals.  But maybe he's not a good example.  But maybe there are
people in the media or genres of discourse that seem to somehow in
some organic or effective or original or fresh way mediate between
these two worlds.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  In a way, I feel like I'm carrying coals to Newcastle to
talk to you about this very issue, because this is, of course, your
bread and butter.  But I--but let me say, you know, first of all, that
I think one of the things that's coming out of this is that the best
kind of--of discourse is a pluralistic one.  You know, Professor
Jamieson was saying, `Well, we need these narratives.' I believe we
do, too.  O--obviously, we need substantive discussion of policy.  You
know, we need that, too.  And I think we need people who can somehow
mediate between these two worlds.
<p>
Now who is doing it?  Well, I mean, there are journalists who do it.
I mean, you can read any newspaper, and you can read, you know, op-ed
pages, and--and there is analysis, and you can get that.  But I don't
think it is as central in the coverage of--of our policy debates as it
should be.  And I don't think it's central because I think that, you
know, the media--and this is not, you know, necessarily a criticism,
you know, of them, frankly, but the media have a tendency to find ways
of framing issues that they think will get public response.  I mean,
that's just a natural thing, I mean, as a writer.  I mean, they are
not policy analysts.  You know, to me, I mean, they're writers.  And
what they're trying to do is--saying, `How do we frame this?  How do
we get a public to understand this?'
<p>
Now that can also distort things.  And--and I think you--you've really
touched upon what is the critical issue here.  The critical issue is
to find individuals, both in--in the political arena, and, I think,
more likely--the more likely candidates will be in--in the arena of
the media to--to perform this central function:  to be able to frame
issues so the public can understand them, but not do it at the expense
of substantive discussion of issues.
<p>
Now that's a challenge.  And I think that it's--it's up to people in
the media to take up that challenge.  Because you won't necessarily
get rewarded for it.  I mean, as we saw from, you know, the--the
Monica Lewinsky situation.  I mean, you get rewarded now--I mean,
everybody wants to be Woodward and Bernstein.  Now everybody wants to
be Mike Isikoff.  That's where you get the books.  That's where you
get the movie sales.  That's where you get the money.  That's where
you get the heroes.  That's what people want to do.  I think, you
know, it's--Isikoff, when he said, `My model was Woodward and
Bernstein,' you know, some journalist 10 years from now is going to
say, `My model was Mike Isikoff.'
<p>
But you've got to find someone and I think they're out there, you
know, who says, `No, you know, my model isn't, you know, Mike Isikoff.
My model isn't Woodward and Bernstein.  I want to do the--the grunt
work.  I want to be the person who says, "Lookit, this is--this is
what this policy issue is about."' And--and I think that's--you know,
I--I say, am I optimistic about this?  Not particularly, because, you
know, my whole theory in my book is that this is an
entertainment-driven society and that newspapers have to sell.  And
that the competition for newspapers is not other newspapers, or even
television.  The competition for newspapers and television is
everything.  We are in a--in a kind of uni-entertainment environment.
You can read a newspaper, or you can watch a video, you can go to the
movies, or you can listen to radio, you--I mean, that's the kind of
environment I think in which we live.  And in that kind of
environment, what is--what--what is going to prompt a journalist to
say, `I'm going to opt out of that a little bit,' when the rewards
might not be there for opting out of it, frankly.
<p>
I mean, we reward those people.  We reward the Mike Isikoffs of the
world.  And if you reward them, you're going to get more of them.  So
somewhere these other kinds of journalists have to be rewarded and,
hopefully, there will be journalists who--I mean, I think it's a
self-motivated thing.  People who say, `I'm going to--I'm going to--to
be a public journalist.'
<p>
JAY:  Point taken.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Neal, why--why can you--why wouldn't you argue, or
couldn't you argue, something that was completely opposite?  That is,
if we view heroes from the movies as being those whom we want to
celebrate as our political leaders, part of that heroism is that
they're all-knowing, that there isn't that much complexity or--or
pluralistic perspectives, because they don't need it.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  That's right.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  They have all of that knowledge in--in their own heads.
And I was struck, and I'm sure many of us read Maureen Dowd yesterday
in The Times, and she--she quotes one of our colleagues, Bud Trillin,
and a Christmas game that he and his wife, Alice, played, which is
that they would give each other countries for Christmas.  And so Alice
would say to Bud, `OK, I'll do Iran for the whole year,' meaning Bud
didn't have to read about Iran, he didn't have to know which dictator
was in charge.  He didn't have to worry about that for a whole year,
because she was going to read it and she was going to tell him about
it.
<p>
Now I find, as Maureen Dowd, I think wa--was quick to comment, that
her criticism of George W.  was that he's not willing to do Iran for
us and that--and that--that we want--we should want of our political
leaders, as hero, that they know things, or that they should know
things, that we don't know or that we don't want to bother to know,
because we're trusting them to know it.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  So why wouldn't we want a more engaged, knowledgeable,
policy-driven, omniscient politician coming out of our movie heroic
myths?
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Well, I--I think that, you know, George W., frankly, has
tapped into something in not knowing all those things.  I think that,
you know, it's not that we valorize the president as being
all-knowing.  We valorize him as being someone who can get things done
and who understands us.  And I think you can play that card another
way.  `Yeah, I don't know all this stuff.  Neither do you, and who
cares?' Ultimately, `I've got advisers for that,' which is what George
W.'s been saying all along.  `I've got advisers who can do that.' I'll
tell you, I think that plays reasonably well with the public.
<p>
You know, there's--there's a--there's--there's a deep--you know,
Richard Hoffsteader.  There's a deep, you know, strain of
anti-intellectualism in this country.  And--and I think people are
very distrustful of individuals who know everything.  I hate to say
this to a--thi--this august company where you do know everything, but
I--I think, you know, that--that--you can play that very easily the
other way.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  OK.  Carolyn, you're our next ...(unintelligible).
<p>
CAROLYN:  As we talk about this issue of how we trade public policy
issues, in particular looking in the direction of opportunities for
supporting it...
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Get the mic.  Oh, thank you.
<p>
CAROLYN:  Oh, sorry.  I want to come back to the issue that came up
between Michael and you where the focus was on the--today we have two
tracks.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
CAROLYN:  We have what I would call the expert track, which is
represented both by the academy and by the politicians.  And we have
the media track, which I think you very eloquently said is moving us
further into f--entertainment, which makes it difficult for them to be
a second track with real integrity.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Exactly.
<p>
CAROLYN:  I think there's a third track that should be on the table
that has arisen in a way because both of those other tracks have less
focus and ability to con--hold peoples' attention.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
CAROLYN:  If you take that fact about Walter Cronkite used to be 60
percent of households were watching him.  Now we take all four major
channels and it's about 17 percent of the population.  I think the
third track that has to be taken seriously in a different way is how
citizens themselves frame these public policy issues in the context of
their daily lives.  And they come up--they have to make meaning.  To
stay an effective human being, you do make meaning, whether you have
all the facts or not.  And they tend to--let me give one example that
I think makes the point.  People who've looked at the issue of
education, public education reform and the issue of safety in schools.
Still today in 1999, we keep this as separate tracks.  Public policy
experts over here voted gun control on this issue and go to teacher's
quality and standards on this issue.  In poll data and intensive
citizen interviews that I became accessed to as a chief of staff in a
state in the '80s, citizens--parents, teachers and children--were
integrating the issue of safety and quality of education articulately
as early as 1980.  And there's some way in which we do not have an
institutional basis for bringing that intelligence as a third track
into how we begin to define issues when we're looking for broad public
outreach about heading in a new direction on one of the very, very
difficult problems facing us.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  I--I--I mean, I agree with you.  And I think one of the
problems is, to--to get back to the notion of the movies, is that we
don't have a way, a matrix, for that.  I mean, before we can have an
institution, we have to have a matrix.  You know, the movies give us a
matrix for thinking about the world, whether it's, you know, a zero
sum game, winners and losers, however.  You know, one--one looks at
that matrix and says, `Lookit, this is how the world is.  It's very
convenient.  It has categories and we can fit things into those
categories,' which is what the media generally does now, and, what I
was saying earlier, some politicians do.  But where's the matrix for
the middle way?  I mean, that, I think, is a--is a critical issue.
And where is it going to come from, this middle way of thinking about
issues?  I wish I had an answer for that, but I don't.  All I know is
that there is a hole.  There is a hole in a matrix about thinking and
framing issues.  And perhaps this commission, you know, is--a part of
its duty is to--is to examine how do you fill that hole?  How do you
create that matrix?
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  That's right.  Bob and then Drew.
<p>
BOB:  I--we've gone onto these wonderful subjects and I'm a little
embarrassed to return to your talk.  There were some problems I had
with it.  You started the talk--or at least I thought we were going to
examine ways in which the movies dealt with issues we could call
public discourse.  And we saw these three examples.  Very quickly, you
turned to the way in which movies then became the idiom for public
discourse, kind of movies of all sorts.  And that's a big subject and
that's a very difficult one to get a grasp on.  And you've studied it
and I wouldn't try to, you know, challenge that, but I'd like to go
back to that very first one because that seems, to me, you left us
with a pretty grim message about heroes and simplicity and good and
bad buys and oversimple resolutions.
<p>
If you recast the meaning of public discourse to include community
action or collective action in movies, wouldn't you get a more
optimistic message?  I'm not a movie buff.  I can't cite all these
examples.  But I have this collective memory of many instances in the
movies where people find a problem in front of them--I'm thinking of
Joyce Appleby's report on communities in the 21st century.  And it
seems to me the movies speak to that capacity of people who are not
experts.  It's something of the subversive capacity you were talking
about.  We go to the movies because we're really pissed off at the
system, you know, we'd really like to sort of see it pulled down.  And
there are, it seems to me, innumerable examples in movies of ordinary
people, so-called, who gather together, who find a problem, who gather
together and who act upon that problem in collective and almost
spontaneous, but in the end, self-organizing ways.  Is it simple?
Yes.  Is it a narrative story that wouldn't have a match in ordinary
life?  Yes.  But does it offer us a different model about
self-empowerment, about the capacity of people in small settings to
say, `To hell with you people out there.  We're going to take care of
our problems ourselves'?  Maybe that's a little more optimistic way of
seeing the movie imagery and ways in which we would like to identify
the possibilities of public discourse for the future.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  I wish I could be, you know, as optimistic as you are
about that, you know, plethora of images.  But I--I really don't think
that they exist anywhere near--I mean, quantitatively speaking.  I
mean, I think on the one hand, you have films that valorize individual
action and that occasionally, as I say, stir people to take action.
But they take action because an individual stands up and says, `Let's
do it.' And the idea is that, you know, people are generally kind of
pacific and passive, but, you know, if somebody will get up there and
lead the way, he can use them as an instrument to get things done.
But I think collective action is something that Hollywood looks
on--and I'm talking now about commercial films and not independent
films--that Hollywood looks--Hollywood looks on, I think, you know,
very skeptically.
<p>
It's just not--you know, you--you can get something like "The
Magnificent Seven," which is, you know, collective action.  You know,
seven people who are experts in each of their, you know, areas get
together to--to--to do something but that's not what you're addressing
here.  And--and I think that there is something deep in--in the
Hollywood psyche, if not in the American psyche, that says, `No,' you
know, `not collectively.' You know, we do this--you know, one man
stands up, and it's usually a man, unfortunately--you know, one man
stands up and he gets it done.  Now we may assist him, he may mobilize
us, but one man gets it done.  And--and there are--I mean, there's a
few films of King Vidov's in the 1930s which are about collective
action.  But even "Grapes of Wrath," when you look at that--I mean,
Tom Joad gets it done!
<p>
BOB:  You know, I'm thinking about a movie like--gosh, here once
again, you know, my--my galloping Alzheimer's is a problem.  That--a
movie about a women's baseball team...
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  "A League of Their Own."
<p>
BOB:  Yeah, that sounds like it.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  But, again, you know, the women get together...
<p>
BOB:  And there are individuals in it but in fact it is that team that
in the end defines what they're able to accomplish.  It's not the
manager.  Hanks is the follower of this team, which in effect--and we
have personal stories.  There are narratives.  We have the old passing
and the new winning or something like that in it.  But it is, it's a
collective team (unintelligible).
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  But compare that then--compare that to one of Jean
Renoir's films in the 1930s where there was no single figure held up
above the other figures.  They were all collective and all figures are
on the same valence.  Now if you look at "A League of Their Own," you
know, Geena Davis is the star of the movie and she's the star of the
team.  Not only the star of the movie, but it's interesting that they
make--she's the star of the team.  You know, it's not as if all of
these individuals are on the same valence working toward, you know, a
single end.  And that's what you have to have.
<p>
BOB:  It's collective action.  Not perfect equality but collective
action.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Well, it's collective action but I think they still
valorize, you know, an individual.  But--but, you know, your point
is--is, again, well-taken.  It's just that you don't find that very
often.  You find that--you know, if you're looking quantitatively,
they are few and far between.  You know, somebody doesn't go in
Hollywood and say, `OK, now we want a bunch of people get together and
they're going to, you know, do something.' You know, it just doesn't
really work that way.  You say you get Tom Cruise and he's going to do
something!  That's the way it works.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  You're--you're next.
<p>
Unidentified Man:  I'm not sure it happens in real life, either.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  No.  It may not be, that's true.
<p>
Unidentified Woman:  I have a question about your notion of audience
and I've been thinking about it.  I thought about it a little bit when
you were talking.  But it seems to me it's gotten to be more of a
problem as we've had our discussion and that is you have a notion of
audience that in some ways is very reassuring because it bespeaks a
unity of the American public that we would like to imagine existed, I
think.  But we've spent a lot of time on location talking about
fragmentations in the American public and we--in the past few minutes
we've been talking about this movie audience that responds in a
certain way and yet at the same time we've been assuming this kind of
generalized response, there have been little hints that there are
those who dissent from that response or that that audience is
characterized by certain attributes.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  That's true.  Yes.
<p>
Unidentified Woman:  You talk about it being very young.  We seem to
be--we, as a group, as "intellectuals," seem to be excluded from that
audience.  And so I wonder how does your argument get complicated if
you complicate the notion of audience that you've offered?
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Well, I think you're absolutely right.  I mean,
it's--it's foolish to think of this kind of unitary audience,
particularly since--I mean, it--one of the things that television and
movies are constantly doing is looking at demographics.  And who's our
demographic?  And who can we exclude because they really don't go to
the movies and who are we targeting these movies toward?
<p>
Unidentified Woman:  It's only black movies and white movies.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  And there are black movies and there are white movies
and now I think, you know, the independent film movement has really
become a separate orientation.  I mean, Hollywood movies are basically
directed towards a relatively young audience...
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  ...and independent movies now are directed towards an
older audience, and--and the twain don't have to meet anymore, which
is something that was--it's a very different situation than the movies
in the '30s and the '40s, when you were thinking generally about a
kind of unitary audience.  The whole family could go to the movies.
Today, I mean--and, again, having two children of my own, I mean, the
family can't go to the movies that often, you know, most of the movies
are R-rated.
<p>
But--but let me put that--that issue aside for the moment because what
we're--what we're really talking about--what I'm addressing here is
not an audience necessarily--the demographics of that audience--but a
mind-set.  And I think the movies have permeated how we think about
the world so deeply over the last 100 years that it's not a matter of
this group of teen-agers goes to the movies and--and this group of
baby boomers doesn't and therefore they're not--their consciousness
isn't affected by the movie consciousness.
<p>
I think the movie consciousness permeates us in so many different ways
other than moviegoing, frankly.  It permeates us, as I was saying
earlier, in the media and how the media frame issues.  It permeates us
through television.  It permeates us through education.  It permeates
us in a whole variety of ways so that in this sense we are all an
audience.  Because all those fragments that you talk about may not go
to the movies, may not watch television.  You know, there are
different audiences that do different things.
<p>
But in the sense that the consciousness of that audience gets
permeated by--or at least affected by--a movie consciousness, I think
we're all affected by that.  We all tend, you know, to--to frame
reality in larger ways or smaller ways through that matrix, and I
include myself in that.  I'm not--this is not an us and them situation
is what I'm saying.  I mean, I think we can't avoid it.  How would you
avoid it when you live within a culture in which we are constantly
bombarded by narratives and images which have been affected by the
movies?
<p>
And I think, you know, television--you know, some scholars see
television as a completely distinct entity from the movies.  But I see
television as--as really a kind of mo--you know, portable form of the
movies.  That so much of what we see on television has been affected
by movie narratives, by movie images.  And--and it's with us, you
know, on a--on a daily basis.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Larry?
<p>
LARRY:  I want you to think about what we--what--well, let's just call
an accidental feature of the movies for a second, that they're
extremely expensive to make well.  And because they're extremely
expensive to make well, that imposes a certain discipline on people
who make these movies about who they're targeted for.  And--and this
is inviting you to think a little bit more about the demographics.
And then compare that--what I want to call an accidental feature of
the movies--to, for example, writing books, which, you know, somebody
can go off for four months or a year into the woods and write a book
and bring it to market after that in a way that they can't go off for
a year...
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Mm-hmm.
<p>
LARRY:  ....and write and make a movie and then bring it to market.
Now I want you to compare that because let's imagine this accidental
feature of the movies changes so that the architecture of making
movies is not such that it costs millions of dollars to do but that,
you know, the technology changes such that basically anybody can put
together really high-quality movies like this.  Would you expect the
dramatic structure to say the--stay the same?
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  That's...
<p>
LARRY:  Because I'm not sure if you looked to the dramatic structure
of books you would think, you know, it follows this particular
stru--and--and maybe that's because books vs.  film, I don't know.
But I'm just inviting you to think about the relationship between the
necessary audience and this dramatic structure.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  That's a very interesting question and I suspect that
what you're talking about--though this is not my fear--field of
expertise and we do have some experts here--will happen on the
Internet, where you will have films that you can download, films that
can be cheaply made and distributed over the Internet.  But here's my
suspicion:  Studios gamble big.  They go to the big table at--at the
movie Las Vegas because they know that only gambling big can they hope
to win big.
<p>
And what that means is that--you know, a movie--a movie may cost $100
million but if it doesn't cost $100 million, you know you're never
going to make $200 million.  This is Hollywood's way of thinking.  And
in point of fact, if you've seen correlations between budget and
audience, it's--it's a--it's a way of thinking that is true.  I mean,
it is--it is validated by attendance.  And it's even more valid when
you think of the foreign market, which is very much directed towards
the kinds of movies that they cannot make because their countries
cannot support the special effects and the action and whatever that
American movies can--can, you know, support.
<p>
So my suspicion is, that, you know, you'll find more tiers.  We're
talking about tiers of discourse.  We'll find more tiers of movies.
There will always be the blockbuster because that's where money is.
You know, Willie Sutton, `Why do I rob banks?' Because that's where
the money is.  Why are studios going to make big movies?  Because
that's where the money is.  And there will be these independent
pictures which make much less money.  I mean, even a "Blair Witch
Project," you know--which is, I guess, the highest grossing
independent movie of all time, inexplicably, you know--but only
grossed, you know, $100 million-something as opposed to a success,
which is, you know, now nearing $300 million.
<p>
And then we'll get these movies that'll be shown on the Internet which
will definitely have--I mean, independent movies have different
narrative structures than Hollywood movies.  I--I suspect that
Internet movies, if that's indeed what the distribution will
be--distribution mechanism will be--will have different narrative
structures than independent movies.  But when you're talking about
books--I mean, you--you're really--you're talking about such
different--a different scale of audience.  I mean, as a writer, I can
tell you that--I mean, you can get on the Best Seller's List if you
sell 50,000 books.  If 50,000 people go to your movie, you better be
looking for another profession.
<p>
Now--I mean, this is something I find almost scandalous, that so few
people--it takes so few people to get a book--I mean, you can put them
all in--in Shea Stadium and that's it, you can have the number-one
best seller.  I mean, you look at--at books that--you know, I--you
look at something like "Tuesdays with Morrie" and what does it say?
They had an ad, you know, `Two years on the Best Seller's List.' Three
million copies in print.  This is a country of 260 million people;
there's three million copies.  That doesn't mean sold, that means
there are three million copies in print.
<p>
Now move that over to the--the Hollywood arena.  Now three million
copies, that would be three million patrons, let's say, paying roughly
$5 apiece, which, believe it or not, is the average ticket
price--although if you live in New York or Los Angeles, you're paying
$9 or something--and--and you'll see that that's $50 million.  That's
the opening weekend for any halfway decent, you know, Hollywood
picture.
<p>
So you're dealing in different scales which allow you--when you're
dealing on different scales, it allows you more latitude.  The movies
where playing with different narrative forms when nobody was going to.
You know, in the late '60s and early '70s, you could have a Robert
Altman come in and say, `Lookit, I'm not going to make a film within
the typical narrative structures.  Why?  Because nobody's going to the
movies anyway.'
<p>
But when you gamble $100 million on the chance that you're going to
make $200 million or $300 million and people are going to the movies,
I mean, what--what tends to happen is the movies become more generic.
And I think the--the narrative structures become more rigid.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Cass.
<p>
CASS:  Yeah.  The remarks--your remarks, seem to me, they describe two
dichotomies.  The individualism vs.  collective action dichotomy and
the heroes and villains vs.  substantive engagement with maybe gray
area.  So the message, I guess, was that there's an implicit politics
to Hollywood that has those two features.  But the clips you showed
show a lot of other possible dichotomies.  And what--I wondered
whether you could speak a bit about that.  It may be that along some
dimensions Hollywood is too heterogeneous to have easy formulations of
what it's concerned with and not.  But with your--with your clips
that--there is implicit criticism there of moral relativism, of
political passivity, of current government and of the current social
order.  In--in some sense in all of them.  So there's dichotomy there.
You know, there's a claim that America has become morally relativist,
but no Hollywood film comes close to e--embracing that.
<p>
Also there is kind of silence and no criticism about what some
consider the repression of religion or indifference to religion or
something.  That was kind of off the table.  Alleged political
correctness wasn't identified, no stand was taken on that.  There's
nothing about homosexuality, one way or the other.  So--so what I
wondered was whether the--the two dichotomies you describe, which seem
right and very important, aren't complemented by about 40 others.  And
to get at Hollywood's implicit politics wouldn't we want to try to
isolate those?
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  I--I--I completely agree with you.  And I--you know, one
thing I ought to take on here is that the word we've been using is
`simplicity.' We've been using that a lot that, you know, it
simplifies.  Now it's not a word I used because the narratives may be
simplified, which is not the same thing, obviously, as being
simplistic, but what the narratives contain is not necessarily either
simplified or simplistic.  I mean, the narratives themselves are
clean.  They have to be that way or we're not going to respond to
them, in my estimation.  But there are all sorts of values within
those narrative lineaments that we respond to.
<p>
And, you know, I can't go, you know, one by one, you know, down
the--down a list but I would say that American movies purvey values
that they think their audience will respond to without crossing a
line, and--and--and kind of having that audience disassociate
themselves from the film.  So that there are certain values that
movies won't purvey.  An--and I'll give you an example of a film.
There was a John Milius film some years ago now called "Red Dawn," as
you--it wasn't a success, and I'll tell you why it wasn't a success in
a minute.
<p>
It was about a--a Russian invasion of the United States and how
Americans--actually, it was a collective movie.  It really was a
collective movie because even though Patrick Swayze was the nominal
hero, it's really about a group of teen-agers who fight as a guerrilla
warf--as guerrilla warfare--fight the Russian invasion.  And there's a
moment in that movie where they come upon a young Russian soldier and
he's unarmed.  And they capture him and they say, `Well, now what do
we do with him?'
<p>
Now almost anyone in this room can tell you what Americans do with an
unarmed Russian soldier.  They take him with them and, you know,
whatever, because he's lost in this cou--and that's how Americans
operate.  Because within the American value system, that's what we do.
That's it.  In this film, Patrick Swayze takes out a gun and shoots
him.  And it violates every value and--you know--I mean, the film was,
obviously, a disaster.  But I just use it as one example.
<p>
There are certain things--there are certain lines you--movies are
transgressive but, you know, it's--it's--you know, like--like Ken Mu
said, `Life is absurd, but some things are too absurd.' The movies are
transgressive, but there's some things that are too transgressive.
And movies operate within that--that boundary.  About a whole ranges
of issues from religion to homosexuality to race to whatever.  I mean,
there are--there are a whole range of--of issues that the movies that
operate within these boundaries you can transgress.  But if you
transgress too much, people don't want to be in the theater.  They
don't want to be there with that movie.
<p>
And in a way--I mean, this is almost the best form of censorship
available.  You know, there are people who want movies to be censored
or whatever, they talk about Hollywood responsibility.  I mean, I--I
believe that the audience, in a way, exercises this responsibility in
that they won't want to see Patrick Swayze shoot an unarmed Russian
soldier with a gun.  Some will, but the vast majority of people in the
audience will not.
<p>
And so the dichotomies you talk about, which are, you know, virtually
infinite, you know, operate in those--in those parameters--and you can
see, you know, a host of id--you know, different positions on a host
of issues in our movies about all sorts of things.  Some that valorize
religion, some that, you know, really never attack religion but attack
the fundamentalism, like "Footloose," of religious prescription.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Joe.
<p>
JOE:  I have a lot of different reactions sort of swimming around to
what you said in my mind and I'm not sure I can get this really clear,
but let me take a stab at it.  In your remarks later, after the talk,
you said that--at one point that you thought that the reason
journalists framed issues the way they frame them was trying to get
the best frame in order to under--enable the public to understand.
<p>
NEAL:  That's one reason, I would say, yes.
<p>
JOE:  I--but I--that's the one I want to pick up on.  Because I guess
I really--I don't believe that's true of the journalists who have been
most affected by the--by the--the ethos that you describe coming over
from movies.  I think it's the newspapers--the best newspaper
journalists still do try to do that.  But I think that--I think that
what is driving most television journalists, which is the one I think
we're really--the kind we're really thinking about terms of pervading
the public, is a desire to--to make a headline, attract an audience
of--attract the largest audience they can possibly ha--they possibly
can, beat their com---beat the--beat their--beat their competitors to
it.  Now that's not new.
<p>
NEAL:  No.
<p>
JOE:  It's not new in the world of journalism.  And I guess I'm
thinking back to journalism--political journalism in the 18th century
in the US, as well as in England.  It's always been sensationalist.
And I'm wondering if the--the media culture that you describe insofar
as it relates to public discourse, particularly about politics but not
just about politics but about issues, really is responding--is--that
television just happens to be the media of the 20th century.  That
what it's responding to essentially is something very deep in the way
in which the public looks at this circus of public events and is more
interested in some kinds of things than other kinds of things.  And so
I do--I'm not sure that telev--television happens to be more pervasive
maybe--maybe in res--in--ma--in relation to the public as a whole than
the pamphleteering and the--the proliferation of newspapers that--that
existed in the 18th century and the 19th century.
<p>
But I'm not sure that--that--that it's all that different.  Now
finally, I want to go back to what Calin was saying just a minute ago.
There's something about the way the public gets information about
public events that has nothing to do with the media culture.  I mean,
I think it's operating at many different levels, as you suggested,
tiers.  I think there is a cut, a--a tier in which the public
perceives events through the large, in the horse race, politics in
the--in the conflict focused--in the hero focused way.  But I think
that there are multiple levels and people do get information through
six degrees of separation from people that they know who have ideas
and who have beliefs about these things.  The public is really--if you
look at the polls on different public issues as I have done, what you
find is that the public today is much more--much better informed about
the subtleties of--of--of political--of--of public policy issues than
they appear to have been in the past.
<p>
I'm not sure that's right, but at--but--but than they appear to have
been.  The public has mani--has manifest in a number of polls on major
issues a remarkable capacity to understand the--the subtle differences
between different approaches.  Maybe they did with respect to the--to
the--to the nuclear testing issue.  I don't know.  I know that they
did with respect to the issue of the--dealing with the--the medical
of--bill of rights issue, because I happened to have looked at that
very recently.  They understood quite clearly that, you know, there
were--there were benefits to one plan, there were--there were costs to
one plan, there were benefits to the other, there were costs to the
other plan.  They understood that and it's reflected.  So I guess what
I'm saying is that despite...
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Right.
<p>
JOE:  ...despite this media culture, the media approach, as you
described, or the movie approach through the media to politics and
public affairs, the public is getting this information from somewhere
and I think that's a very interesting part of the way we need to look
at the question because there may be ways of shaking it.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Well, you've said two things that--and the--the
second--now I agree with you that--I mean, we are a very diverse
society with all sorts of different sources of information.  Now
clearly--I mean, the media, the television and--and newspapers are the
main source of information.  But there are other ways of getting
information and--and you'll never find me denigrating the American
public.  I mean, I--I'm always amazed at--at, you know, how astute
they are.
<p>
The first thing you were saying is that this is not new.  I--I--in
fact, you've just kind of given the thesis of my book because what I
talk about in the book--this is not revolutionary.  This is
evolutionary.  We're constantly finding new ways, new, more
sophisticated, more pervasive ways of entertaining the public, whether
it's through the journalism or in other ways.  And this was true in
the 19th century.  I mean, the penny press was clearly an
entertainment medium.  It wasn't just an information medium, it was an
entertainment medium.  Information comes in all packages.  But the
information they were purveying came in one package:  sensationalism.
<p>
And--and I think, you know, the difference now may not even be one of
pervasiveness.  It may be one of sophistication, that we're more
sophisticated about how the system operates, which is one of the
reasons why I think we don't always respond to the system the way that
one--one might anticipate we would respond to it.  And the system
itself is more sophisticated in how it's entertaining us.  I will just
give you one--one little anecdote.  When I was out promoting my book,
I did "The O'Reilly Factor," which is one of these cable television
programs that is dedicated to public policy as comment.  I mean,
that's essentially what it's about.
<p>
And I said to O'Reilly--you know, I said, `You'--the Lewinsky story
was going on and he was one of these people who, you know, every
day--the drumbeat was constant.  And I said, you know, `You're really
going to miss the Lewinsky story.' I mean, which is--as a--I know you
all probably know this is true that, you know, `It--it boosted your
ratings and when it's gone, you know, your ratings are going to go
back down again.' And he look at me and he said--and he said this one
air--he said, `Oh, no.  He said there'll always be JonBenet Ramsey.'
<p>
And I--I think, you know, that that's a kind of--of media
consciousness.  And if not JonBenet Ramsey, then, you know, something
else because there will always be what in my book I call a lifie,
which is a movie written in the medium of life that the media can
then, you know, exploit for our entertainment pleasure.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Just...
<p>
JOE:  Can I ask a follow-up question?
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Yes.
<p>
JOE:  This has a--totally irrelevant but it's one I've thought about
it in the course of your talk--talking about movies.  I guess I
wondered why a--I think about maybe the best movie I ever saw
recently--in recent--recent years which will show you how many movies
I've seen, was "Chariots of Fire." Now I want to ask, you know,
which--with--I want to--I'd like to get a better understanding of why
we don't have more films like that, which really do address the sort
of thing that you were talking about--"The Omega Code," in fact, was
aspiring to, but couldn't do.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  And again, I would go back to, you know, risk factor.  I
mean, the risk factor of making a small movie for--now a small movie
is $20 million or $30 million, you know, is much higher than the risk
factor.  And this is just all cost analysis--I--the risk factor of
making a $100 million movie.  I mean, it really comes down to that.
You know, the more simplified the narrative structures, the more
likely you can export that movie, the more likely that a young
audience will respond to that movie.
<p>
The more complicated the film--it's almost a difference between
popular literature--and literature, one could ask the same question.
Why Stephen King and not John Updike, you know?  Well, one is, you
know, relatively simplified narrative structure, the other is not.
More people are going to read one than the other and, you know,
Stephen King gets $40 million for, you know, a four-book deal and I
don't know what Updike gets but I can guarantee you it's considerably
less than that.  And I think that's the--you know, the short answer.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  We have so many more questions and we're out of time.
Will you folks indulge me five more minutes because I think that
there's wonderful conversation here, I hate to cut off all the
questions.  We have one at least on our Web-based group...
<p>
JENNIFER:  That's right.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  ...and, Jennifer...
<p>
JENNIFER:  Yes.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  ...if you want to start with that we'll just take a few
minutes.
<p>
JENNIFER:  We have a question from one of our participants on our Web
site rel--and it's related somewhat to--to your point, Jay, and also
to Joel Fleischman's point.  `It seems that politics as entertainment
discourse that uses entertainment-style methods are--to invoke the
title of a relatively recent film--a case of the tail wagging the dog.
There seems to be real danger in this cycle.  How can the public or
audience sift through it all?  Are there good models?'
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Well, I--I--let me invoke Nancy Reagan.  I mean, you
just say no.  You know, we're a very sophisticated public and we have
to respond with sophistication.  You know what?  I think it's--it's
amazing that, according to The New Yorker this week, Steve Forbes will
pour, you know, some $10 million-something into New Hampshire and
drive down--I guess he's targeting George Bush because George Bush is
in the lead, just as he targeted Bob Dole four years ago--and drive
down his numbers.  Now you say to yourself, if you're--if you're a
voter in New Hampshire, you know what's happening.  You know that he's
spreading either disinformation or whatever about this candidate.  Why
should that drive down the poll numbers?  Why don't you just disregard
it?  Why don't you just say, `He's pouring $10 million here.  He's
saying things that I didn't believe two weeks ago, why should I
believe them now?  And, you know, it--it won't be part of my mental
process.'
<p>
We know that the media is going to find something about all of these
candidates and that it's going to latch onto--as I was saying
earlier--this week it's John McCain's temperament.  It was, you know,
George Bush's cocaine.  Guaranteed they'll do something about Bill
Bradley.  I mean, that's the way it works.  So why don't you just
disregard, say, `This is fun.  This is entertaining.  I kind of enjoy
this but I'm not going to let it affect how I--how I respond to the
candidate.'
<p>
You see, we can have our entertainment and eat it too if we play this
game, you know, wisely.  I--and then in the pop--in--in doing so, we
may actually convert the press into responding to us differently.  I'm
not hopeful about that but I'm more--I--I'm somewhat hopeful that the
public can learn to disregard those things that have nothing to do
with the qualification of a candidate or with substantive public
policy discussions.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  The members of the commission will have more of a chance
to visit with Neal at lunch and continue your questions.  Let me take
the last question from Wendy Steiner, who is another expert in modern
culture that--chair of the English department at Penn and the director
of the Penn Humanities Forum.  Wendy.
<p>
Ms. WENDY STEINER (Penn Humanities Forum):  Is it OK if I speak
without a microphone or should I...
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  Yeah.  You need a mic.
<p>
Ms. STEINER:  OK.  Of course, you make statements like this and
immediately counter examples come mind.  I think of "The Mod Squad" or
something.  Isn't that the one with Mr. T, where everybody was a
specialist and they all worked...
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  "A-Squad."
<p>
Ms. STEINER:  The...
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  "A-Team." "A-Team," excuse me.  Yeah.
<p>
Ms. STEINER:  "The A-Team."
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Yeah.
<p>
Ms. STEINER:  And--OK.  But this argument that says you have to give
the public what it wants and the public only wants what we give it,
is--because it's totally shaped by the media in every way.  It's one
of those circles that become the real fix in any--and--and you--you
can justify anything under those grounds.  The fact is that there are
all kinds of things that Hollywood could do in making a film that
could break into the cycle of fairy tales presented as hard-hitting
whatevers.
<p>
And--you know, I--I'm constantly struck by how little advantage is
taken of all the different kinds of genres.  All ki--the genres and
kinds of fictions that are available to Hollywood.  Something like
"American Beauty" that was just made.  It strikes me as a very tough
movie and apparently people have liked it an awful lot and I--I really
think that Hollywood can tell people that they're going to like
something and they very often do even when it doesn't fulfill the
kinds of patterns that it allegedly prefers.
<p>
But it--but--but the one--one of the kinds of plots that is so seldom
dealt with is when it talks about unsurety where there are equally
good alternatives and people just don't know what to do under those
circumstances, which is a very important kind of plot for a democracy
to take into account where you have to deal with opposing viewpoints,
where there's right on both sides...
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Right.
<p>
Ms. STEINER:  ...and--and negotiate your way through that.  I mean,
there are things that Hollywood could do that would be of tremendous
service to the--to the American people and so to--simply to keep on
going and dishing out more of the same is--on the grounds that it no
doubt is the only way to make money seems a very defeatist way of
going about things.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  I--I'm not ju--you're certainly not going to find me
defending Hollywood on this--on this basis, but let me just--let me
just say a few things.  In Hollywood, I mean, there's a way to fail.
And, you know, you look at this in very human terms, these are people
who have a job and they want to keep that job.  And if they fail the
way that everyone else fails, they keep the job.  If you fail in new
ways, you don't.  I mean, it really does come down to that.  Now in
"American Beauty," you know--will be a success and one presumes it
will be nominated for the Academy Award and whatever and will wind up
now--I guess it made $68 million coming into this weekend and, you
know, one assumes it'll make something like $100 million.
<p>
That's very, very good.  But if you're a studio head and you've only
got "American Beauties"--and that--and that movie's a success, a risky
success, you're not going to hold your job.  And--and so what--what
we're really talking about is not--not the morality of this but
the--the--who wants to take the risk?  Who wants to take that risk,
put himself on the line and say, `Oh, that idiot.  Why in the world
did he make that movie?  Why in the world did he do that?'
<p>
You know, it's one thing to make a Schwarzenegger movie and fail.  You
can survive that because anybody would have made the Schwarzenegger
movie.  So he's only doing what everybody else in the studio would
have done.  I mean, it--it's an industry that is very much geared to
saying no, not to saying yes.  Like almost every industry in America.
Like college admissions or anything else.  It's all geared to saying
no.  Because if you say yes to the wrong thing, then you lose your
job.  So I--I'm not quarreling with what you're saying, I'm--I'm
simply saying that there is kind of logic to the system within
Hollywood.  And those of us who want better movies, you know, we--we
may want to say, `Well, why don't you crack that logic?  Why don't you
operate in a different logical system?  Operate outside that logic.'
<p>
But again, I--you know, I don't want to be a--a Cassandra here, a
doomsayer, but I don't think it's very likely to happen.  Now we'll
get another--we'll get, you know, five more movies like "American
Beauty," as we always do whenever there's a success, and chances are
all five of them will fail.  But--and then nothing will be done for
another, you know, few years and then there'll be another movie that
will come out and, you know, small movie that will be successful and
Hollywood will try and imitate that.  You know, imitation is the
sincerest form of flatulence.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  I'd like to thank Neal for a really provocative session.
<p>
Mr. GABLER:  Thank you very much.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  We are adjourned to where?
<p>
Unidentified Man:  ...(Unintelligible) the lobby.
<p>
Dr. RODIN:  OK, through the lobby into the other side.  Thank you.
