<blockquote>
The following are some of the key ideas that have emerged from the
Commission's work.  These ideas have played a central role in determining
our plans for the future:
<blockquote>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Incivility Is Not New<br>
        </b> Incivility and coarseness are a continuation of behaviors that have 
        always been with us. However, these behaviors are greatly amplified by 
        the new economic dynamics of mass markets, by the new technologies of 
        mass communication, and by laissez-faire governmental policies. 
        <p> 
      <li><b>The Centrality of Public Discourse<br>
        </b> Effective public discourse, or &quot;public talk,&quot; plays a central 
        role in the functioning of a well-ordered democratic society and can facilitate 
        productive dialogue on such &quot;hot-button&quot; issues as immigration, 
        race, abortion, and affirmative action. The processes of engaged, productive 
        public discourse de-sensitize such issues and facilitate co-existence, 
        even in the face of frank opinions and irresolvable disagreements. 
        <p> 
      <li><b>The "Thinning" of Public Discourse<br>
        </b> Population growth, technological change, mass migrations, economic 
        development, widespread literacy and education, and a plethora of new 
        and sometimes unfamiliar voices in the cultural mix have made public discourse 
        more diffuse, &quot;thinning&quot; it, in the words of historian and commission 
        member Thomas Bender. As a result, &quot;bad&quot; discourse sometimes 
        seems louder and more dominant, while productive public talk can be harder 
        to hear, recognize, and participate in. The Commission's recommendation 
        is the &quot;thicken&quot; public discourse by surrounding uncivil behaviors 
        with a wealth of constructive and energetic public debate. 
        <p> 
      <li><b> Effective Public Discourse Has Changed<br>
        </b> A useful formulation of what constitutes effective public discourse 
        emerged from a review of the scholarly literature on this subject prepared 
        for the Commission by Dr. David M. Ryfe of the University of California 
        at San Diego. Ryfe says that while traditionally good discourse has been 
        interpreted solely as rational argument, today good deliberative discourse 
        integrates rational arguments with narratives, personal experiences, expressions 
        of emotion, and empathetic listening. Discourse fashioned along these 
        lines will be argumentative -- but argumentative in a way that seeks to 
        achieve greater inclusion and stronger communal bonds. 
        <p> 
      <li><b>Different Institutions Playing a More Important Role<br>
        </b> The Commission has concluded that a variety of social and cultural 
        institutions -- from neighborhood cultural institutions, community foundations, 
        and local museums, historical societies, libraries, and universities to 
        corporations, sports teams, and the military -- have assumed new and important 
        roles in creating &quot;communities of conversation&quot; among increasingly 
        isolated individuals and groups. Historically, many of these organizations 
        have not seemed central to the creation of a sense of community or to 
        the provision of forums where citizens can engage in frank public dialogue. 
        In many instances, these organizations now fill the gaps left by social 
        and cultural changes, creating and engaging diverse communities and using 
        their professional resources to foster productive public discussion. 
        <p> 
      <li><b>The Importance of Effective Discourse Leadership<br>
        </b> The Commission's analyses of the public discussions surrounding major 
        policy issues such as affirmative action, campaign finance reform, immigration, 
        health care, tobacco, civic journalism, and arts funding have highlighted 
        the crucial role that leaders in all walks of life play in shaping and 
        setting the tone for public talk. Preliminary research sponsored by the 
        Commission suggest that even small improvements in such leadership can 
        reduce conflict and stabilize communities. 
        <p> 
      <li><b>Creating Communities of Conversation<br>
        </b> Public culture is the place where we constantly negotiate the boundaries 
        of privacy and public interest and the tensions created by different visions 
        of the public good. The Commission has concluded that these is a need 
        for a more active and self-conscious effort -- a national movement -- 
        to foster a public culture that supports the building of strong, inclusive 
        communities through substantive, honest, and productive public conversation.
