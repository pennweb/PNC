<p>

PAUL BEGALA:  OK.  Thanks, Judy.  Just to set the stage briefly,
I'd ask you to recall some of the examples and the litany of
intolerant and uncivil behaviors we discussed when we met in December.
Folks talked about a culture of immediacy and intolerance that runs
throughout popular culture, from talk radio to road rage to incivility
on the floor of the Congress.  Running through those examples of
absolutism and demonization and lack of public restraint seems to be
an unwillingness or an inability to recognize others as individuals or
communities with rights, feelings and needs, in particular as
individuals with experiences that may be radically different from our
own.
<p>
So from different experiences come different perceptions and
interpretations of what might otherwise purport to be the same
objective neutral reality.  That, it seems to me, is the fundamental
problem at the root of many of the behaviors and attitudes that we
discussed in December.  I believe that there are very few public
policy issues that more clearly illustrate or dramatically illustrate
these behaviors than the debate over affirmative action.  So I'm very
grateful today that we have Professor Christopher Edley Jr.  to help
us understand how this debate exemplifies [the] culture of intolerance
that
we've become so concerned with in this group.
<p>
Professor Edley has taught at the Harvard Law School since 1981.  He's
the author of the very well-received book, "Not All Black And
White:  Affirmative Action and American Values." Chris is a graduate
of Swarthmore College, up the road, and of the Kennedy School of
Government and the Harvard Law School.  He served as assistant
director of the domestic policy staff in President Carter's White
House and was national issues director for the Dukakis campaign.  More
recently, after serving as the senior adviser on economic policy
during the Clinton-Gore transition, Chris was persuaded to stay on in
the government at the Office of Management and Budget, to oversee
major legislative policy initiatives.
<p>
He also served as special counsel to the president and led
the Clinton administration's review of affirmative action
programs.  After that he was wise enough to escape Washington as
described by Kevin, probably wisely, and went back to Harvard to teach
and, perhaps, a little R&R.  But as they say, a highly placed
administration source assures me that he has been lured back--or will
be soon--to serve as senior policy adviser, at least on a part-time
basis, to the president on the race initiative that he hopes
to begin.
<p>
So it is a particular pleasure, I think, to bring to you my friend,
Chris Edley.
<p>
CHRISTOPHER EDLEY:  Thank you, Paul.  I deny
most of what you said, and I'm honored to have been invited to talk to
such a terrific group and see several old friends or--Is that Lani?  I
thought I would try to do two things.  I don't have a watch, so rather
than throwing something at me, let me borrow a watch.  I thought I'd
try to talk quickly about two things.  One is a few points
about affirmative action itself.  I'm sorry--technology here.  I'm all
set.  A few points about affirmative action itself and then I'd like
to apply it to a concrete problem, and the concrete problem, of
course, is what would one say, if you happen to be in the position of
trying to advise the president, about what he should do on Saturday in
San Diego when he launches this much-touted race initiative, and
relatedly, what should the rest of us, who would like to play a
constructive role on this issue, do in response or at the same time
that the president is trying to do whatever it is he's going to try to
do?
<p>
OK.  So Part One, on affirmative action itself:  There are lots of
policy disagreements on affirmative action and on race, more broadly.
You could--in a way, you could arrange the policy arguments.  Imagine
a matrix, and for the rows think of education, employment and
contracting--education, employment, contracting; and for the columns,
think of a range of different kinds of tools or interventions that one
might adopt in each of those contexts, starting on one end with soft
measures like outreach and recruitment, to maybe soft measures for
inclusion, like simply making race a consideration in an admissions
decision, to somewhat firmer measures--a thumb on the scale, some kind
of a bonus, to still firmer, maybe a goal, and ultimately to a
quota or a set-aside.
<p>
So one could imagine a range of interventions in various contexts.
Now if you fill in all of the cells of that matrix, it's not easy to
see that there are a multitude of contexts and tools in which to think
about the appropriate way in which immutable characteristics like race
or gender might play in decision-making.  Now--and even within a
particular context, for example, employment:  If one makes a
conclusion that, sure, it makes sense to take race into account at
least in some circumstances, with respect to employment, well, when
you say employment, do you mean hiring or do you also mean promotion?
And if you mean promotion, what about layoffs?  A multitude of
contexts and the arguments might differ.  So an initial problem is
simply that the complexity of the policy settings almost numbs the
mind when it comes to try to make general statements about what our
policies might be.
<p>
Nevertheless, of course, in public policy discourse and political
discourse and, indeed, at cocktail parties, one tries to speak
in an abbreviated way, not only to simplify the reality underneath
the policy argument, but also in simplified ways, in terms of--well,
as James Carville would put it, `I'm right; you're wrong.  I'm right;
you're wrong,' which, in fact, is why I called my book "Not All Black
And White," because the most important conclusion, for me, is that
talking about race, talking about affirmative action is not rocket
science.  It's harder than rocket science.
<p>
Now if thinking deeply about the problem can't be working through the
details of each cell of this matrix, then obviously there has to be
some search for what the deeper issues are, what the
deeper values are at stake.  For example--and I think our first or
second conversation with President Clinton back in 1995, during the
affirmative action review--I posed a question this way:  I said,
`Look, do you believe that there is a moral cost to making decisions
about people based upon their immutable characteristics, like color or
gender?  Do you believe there is a moral cost?'
<p>
Now there are at least three ways of answering that question.  Some
people think, `Yes, there is a moral cost, and the moral cost is so
great that we should never be willing to pay it.' This is the
colorblind perspective.  `It's just wrong.' At the other end of
the spectrum, there's some people who think that paying attention with
color gender is, in fact, really no different from paying attention to
a lot of other factors on which we sort people and allocate benefits
and burdens when we make public policy or private choices--geography,
income, what have you--athleticism--it's simply another variable that
one could rationally decide to use in making decisions.
<p>
Race is not different.  In the middle ground
there is a position that, `Yes, there is a moral cost, a special moral
cost, but we ought to be willing to pay that cost in at least some
circumstances.' If you take that middle position, you're then drawn
into arguing about, `Well, what might those circumstances be, that
would provide a justification for paying attention to race?'
<p>
My point is this:  The first position, that there is a cost and it [is]
too
great a cost to bear, is distinguishable from the second position and
the third position, but has a logical coherence to it.  And, indeed,
it has a moral coherence to it.  In our arguments about race, in our
arguments about affirmative action, in particular, it seems to me, and
I argued it's important to understand what the difference is in value
commitments that may animate this dispute between the first position
and either the second or the third, specifically.  One possible
explanation is that people who hold the first position are simply less
concerned than I am, for example, about effectiveness.  They might
say, `I'm against discrimination; I'm in favor of racial justice, but
I'm not particularly concerned with consequentialist arguments about
what kind of tool is needed in order to achieve it, because 
I have a higher principle of color-blindness that to me is more
important than instrumental arguments about what measures might be
needed in order to achieve equality.'
<p>
I am enough of an instrumentalist, enough of a utilitarian to feel
uncomfortable with that position, but I understand it.  I understand
it.  Now it's not crazy.  I mean, I think the death penalty is,
perhaps, an example.  Now lots of us have a view about the death
penalty, pro or con, that depends upon an assessment of whether we
believe the death penalty will deter crime.  You may look at the
evidence and conclude, `It's a lousy deterrent, therefore I oppose the
death penalty.' You may look at the evidence and conclude, `Well,
maybe it can be a good deterrent, therefore I support the death
penalty, provided it's administered in such and such a way.'
<p>
There are other people whose perspective--whose moral position is
quiet different.  Their view may be, `I believe in the sanctity of
human life, and therefore'--dot-dot-dot.  Well, therefore, they may
reason the state should never take another life, or therefore, an eye
for an eye, whatever.  It's a moral position that has nothing to do
with an instrumental calculation about deterrence.  Showing somebody
who has that perspective a new social science study isn't going to
influence them at all.  Similarly, it seems to me, on race the role
that evidence has in argument depends a little bit on the moral
position of the opponent.  And clarifying the distinction between
moral positions, it seems to me, is useful.  I'll come to the why in a
moment.
<p>
Next difficult question:  If you believe that there is a moral cost,
but that it might sometimes be worth paying, well, when?  Now, of
course, within the legal framework the most obvious explanation is to
say remediation, to remedy discrimination.  The difficulty, of course,
is that if you scratch the surface, we have huge disagreements about
what discrimination is, how to define it, how to measure it.
Disagreements, for example, with some people believing that it's not
discrimination unless there is racial animus dripping from the lips of
a perpetrator and an identifiable victim.  On the other end, you have
people who think, `Well, any kind of observed social or economic
disparity, I think that's discrimination.  I don't have to see animus;
I don't have to see intent.  I've just got to inequality that to me is
unobjectionable, is objectionable.  That's evidence of
discrimination and I want to do something about it,' and, of course, a
range of attitudes in between.
<p>
My point, again, is this is harder than rocket science.  Simply
saying, `I'm against discrimination.  I'm against discrimination' is
at best a platitude; at worst, it's obfuscation because the difficult
issues that divide us are not about opposition to
discrimination.  It's about the difficult moral choice of, `Well, how
are going to define it?  How are we going to measure it?  And
obviously, what are you going to do about
it?'
<p>
Choosing a definition of discrimination as its well known to folks who
studied this--studied this field involves making commitments familiar
to political philosophers, focusing on individual culpability, on the
one hand, or focusing instead on our ideals about community,
on the other, basic commitments.  Part of the problem in wrestling
about race is that the communal impulse and the traditional
individualistic liberal impulse both run deep in our political
culture.  A legal or policy or moral position that is reductionist,
that tries to embrace only one of those two alternatives, seems to me
to open itself necessarily to serious disagreement, which isn't to say
there aren't extremists on either side.  I was just in the debate with
William F.  Buckley, for example.
<p>
Well, I could say more about discrimination, but let me go on to a
third deeply difficult issue.  Accepting that remedying
discrimination, however defined, might provide a justification in
certain circumstance or for paying attention to race, gender, is that
the only justification?  I remember a discussion in with the
president.  Ab, I don't remember if you were in this
particular meeting, but the suggestion was, `Well, Mr.  President, you
can support affirmative action and explain your support for it simply
by saying it's necessary as a measure to remedy and prevent
discrimination, right?  Note that we've embraced a utilitarian
framework.  It's necessary to remedy and prevent discrimination.' And
he said, `Yeah, that sounds right.  That's right.'
<p>
And the argument was, `Yeah, that's the high moral ground.
You can explain that.  You can defend that.  No problem.  Of course,
defining discrimination is difficult, but at least there's a position
people can understand.' Nods all around.  I said, `Well, wait a
minute.  I'm not so sure.  You said that you want a Cabinet that looks
like America.  Now did you say you want a Cabinet that looks like
America because you wanted to remedy discrimination suffered by Ron
Brown and Hazel O'Leary and Donna Shalala or where you trying to
remedy discrimination committed by previous presidents, in the way in
which they selected their advisers?  No, of course not.  You said
because you were persuaded that by being inclusive you would build a
Cabinet that would do a better job of serving you and serving the
American people.'
<p>
That's a diversity rationale and inclusion rationale that is logically
and, I believe, morally distinguishable from the antidiscrimination
rationale, from the remediation rationale.' And he said, `OK.  OK.
I've got it.  OK.  So I'm in favor of affirmative action because we
want to remedy discrimination.' I said, `Remedy and prevent, right.
Remedy and prevent discrimination and for diversity.' He said, `Yeah,
that sounds right.  That sounds right.'
<p>
I said, `Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I mean, you're in favor of
diversity in your Cabinet and with federal judges, and I know you
believe in it for university admissions.  What about the widget factory
in Pocatello?  And you say you're in favor of it in hiring; well, what
about layoffs?' Silence.  I said, `Look, it's just not that easy.
It's not that easy.  You can be in favor of diversity, but does
it then follow that it has equally weighty moral significance in all
of these contexts we're talking about?  Context matters.' At which
point I think Stephanopoulos says, `How are we going to explain this?'
<p>
Does diversity provide a moral justification for paying attention to
color?  Again, underneath our disagreement about that are disputes
about the way the world is and disputes about what we want the world
to be.  The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, in the Hopwood case last
year, wrote that in their view, not withstanding the Supreme
Court in Bakke or several of the justices in Bakke, anyway, diversity
had never been a compelling interest to justify race-conscious
measures in university admissions, public institutions.  We accept the
notion that universities should care about inclusion, about diversity,
but paying attention to diversity on the basis of race, color, is as
irrational in the admissions process as paying attention to--what do
they say?--hair color and weight, blood type.
<p>
Well, I mean, I don't know what planet they're on.  I don't know what
planet they're on, but they're obviously looking at the world in a
very different way from mine.  And they're obviously evaluating the
kind of community that should be created on campuses in a way that's
different from university leaders around the country--remediation,
yes; diversity, maybe.  Another argument, another difficult argument:
Well, doesn't all of this conflict with merit?  Conflict with merit?
Huge arguments about that.  Well, many things could be said, have been
said.
<p>
One set of issues concerns the instruments that are
used for measurement of merit.  The tests are not good predictors.
They're not good predictors of what it is they claim to predict, for
example, the SAT predicting first-year performance in college.  OK.
The correlation coefficient of about .4 explains about 15
percent, 16 percent of the variation.  I think Lani has written with
Susan Stern that's about as good as a predictor as
weight predicts height--not great.  And not a good
predictor for anyone--not just for minorities, but for anyone.  And,
of course--well, what are we predicting, anyway?  Why is that what you
want to predict?  Why is that what you would want to define as merit
in the first place?  Serious disagreements about that.
<p>
Bad instruments--for everyone, you need to amend or abandon the
instruments, one could argue.  Now there's a second line of argument,
that merit depends on mission--that merit depends on mission.  I was
on a panel yesterday at the Twentieth Century Fund with George Rupp,
the president of Columbia, and he said, `Look'--echoing the wonderful
AAU president's statement published a couple of weeks ago--he said,
`Look, inclusion is important.  Diversity is important, first, because
it contributes to the educational mission of our institutions, and
second, because we're trying to prepare leaders.' Well, that's fine,
but of course, the deciding on the mission of the institution is
contestable--what it ought to be--deeply contestable.  Another problem
is that one has to keep in mind in what form one's making these
arguments.
<p>
I said, `Look, you say that inclusion promotes the
educational mission of the institution.  The 5th Circuit
in Hopwood didn't seem to believe that.  Apparently the
Board of Regents at the University of California doesn't believe
that--or at least doesn't believe it very seriously.  So where's the
beef?  Where's your evidence?  Where's your proof?  You're
hand-waving.  You're citing dead social philosophers,
which isn't really much better than citing dead judges for the
proposition.' There is disagreement of an empirical sort as to what
kind of contribution inclusion can make as well as disagreement with
respect to the values that are being pursued.
<p>
Now lastly, I want to point out that even if we cross the hurdle of
saying that, `Yes, there are some circumstances in which we should pay
attention to race or gender, what have you,' the appropriateness of,
say, race-conscious measures in a given context will depend, to a
great extent, it seems to me, on the details of that context.  And the
nuances--the details of the way in which a tool is designed will
depend a lot on the context.  For example, we have this notion,
certainly in the law, that you shouldn't unnecessarily trammel the
interests of bystanders and the white guys, right?  Don't just
gratuitously deprive them of various benefits and opportunities.  Do
it carefully, I suppose, or at least think about it carefully, try to
minimize the extent to which you do that.
<p>
Well, that makes sense, and of course, it follows directly 
from our first assumption, namely that there is a moral cost.
Obviously we want to try to minimize that moral cost by designing a
tool differently.  Well, how do you design it differently?  You can't
design it differently without having a big argument about how much do
we care about the fact, say, that a certain kind of small business
contractor doesn't get an opportunity to bid on a certain subset of
Air Force contracts.  Is that a big problem or is that a little
problem that we should worry about?--obviously, again, a sharply
contestable proposition.  How do we feel about an emphasis on
inclusion and diversity when it comes to promotion, as compared with
layoffs in the Piscataway case in New Jersey that's been in the press
so much?  Even if you think it's important to have diversity within
the high school, is it important to have diversity within the faculty
of the business department of that high school?  Room for argument,
it's not all black and white.
<p>
Bottom line--and it echoes what Paul said in his introduction:  I am
persuaded beyond any shadow of a doubt that if one peels away the
platitudes and the ugliness and the heated words in so much of the
debate on race, one can identify, in a fairly systematic way, some
sharp disagreements of an empirical sort and some sharp disagreements
of a moral sort or of a value sort.  It also seems obvious that our
differences with respect to perceptions of the world and our
differences with respect to values, are both rooted in and in turn
fuel the distance between our communities.  Our perceptions and our values
shaped by our experiences.  our experiences shaped by our community.  Our
communities
separate.  Now in the papers this morning,
yesterday Gallup announced the results of this great big study that
they've done on black-white perceptions.  They're going to do Latinos,
eventually, but this was just black-white.  Over 3,000 people sampled,
great big thick book of findings.  I went to the briefing last night,
and what was interesting is that as they talked about America's
attitudes on race--black attitudes, white attitudes and so forth--all
the black folks in the room were sitting there grumbling to each
other, getting angrier and angrier and angrier.  Why?  This is so
obvious, right?  I mean, of course, yeah.  What's the big deal?  I
mean, there was resentment festering in
this group of, you know, fairly fancy people, just because it seemed
so obvious that the contrasts in perceptions of the way the
world is between black and white was such old news that it--I mean,
the hors d'ouevres were not good enough to justifying having come to
the event.
<p>
The problem, therefore, it seems to me, this--I think this is called
transition--the problem, therefore, is when we observe the differences
in perception and we observe the differences in values that are
animating the policy battles--ugly battles, and we further observe
that those differences are rooted in separateness of communities, what
do you do?  What do you do?  Period, paragraph:  OK, so now I want to
rewind and go back a couple of months, and let's pretend that we're
sitting in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing, and one of the
president's aides says, `Well, look, the president talked all during
the campaign about this bridge to the 21st century and how we all to
come together to walk over the bridge together.' Paul probably wrote
that stuff, right?  OK.
<p>
And so we talked about unity, unity, unity, unity.  And he talked
about unity in the State of the Union and all that rest of it.  So
what we want to figure out is how do you do it?
We needed unity initiative, right?  That's
the purpose of that meeting, a unity initiative.  And
Governor--former Governor Winter of Mississippi says, `Race--you ought
to do something on race.' The president is interested in doing
something on race.  Great.  OK.  First, problem:  Do you do something
on race or do something on difference, right?  Is it race only or is
it race plus gender, plus sexual orientation, plus
disability, plus class, plus--What is it?  Which should it be?
There's the first choice.
<p>
OK.  Does everybody understand the setting, right?  This
is a group of folks that are trying to do what you're trying to do,
mainly, they're trying to figure out how do we improve civic culture?
How do we bring the country together?  How do we do good things for
America?  Hard question.  Is it race or is it race-plus?  Second
question:  Let's assume it's race.  Does that mean that we should set
to work on $100 billion urban Marshall Plan, right?  An initiative to
fix K through 12 education, and somebody said, `Well, Lani Guinier
says we need to have a national conversation on race.  So maybe what
the president ought to do is lead a national conversation on race.'
And other people said, `Well, that's just hot air.  We have to
actually do something.' So there's a second question.
<p>
Is it just conversation?  Is it just policy pronouncement?  Or is
there a third option?  Now here's my answer to that,
for what it's worth, and then you all can throw things at me and
I'll--and I'll subside.  I've actually written
something, an op-ed piece co-authored with Jesse Jackson, in fact.
This is calculated to give the president a heart attack.
<p>
And here's our basic thesis:  Conversation about race is fine, but
interracial civility is not an end in itself.  The initiative needs to
be not about civility, but about justice.  It needs to be not about
the discussion gap, but about the opportunity gap, the investment gap.
But bold measures to address the opportunity gap will be stillborn
because so many of our policy discussions on the social and economic
challenges facing the country are poisoned by color.
<p>


And so long as the political face on various economic and social
challenges, so long as the political face on the problem is black or
brown or yellow, our politics is poisoned and the possibility of
consensus is handicapped, so an opportunity agenda that does not
simultaneously address the problem of connecting communities so that
you create the possibility of bringing values and perceptions together
won't work.
<p>
So the argument is not either-or conversation and program but both.
That's one point.  And the reverse is true also.  You can't have
racial justice without having equal opportunity.  You can't have
racial understanding without closing the opportunity gap.  So it's
both.  As I said, this is harder than rocket science.
<p>
The second piece of it has to be if you're going to have
conversations, what kind of conversations?  Now here my thesis--and
this is towards the end of my book and it's very
sketchy is as follows--well, let me do it by
way of anecdote.
<p>
There was a--lawyers do that--shortly after I began
teaching at Harvard there was a dinner for the newly appointed elected
cardinal in Boston, Cardinal Law--and I was invited to have
dinner with him, with a couple of people.  I don't know why I was
invited.  I am not Catholic.  I'm not particularly religious.  It must
have been affirmative action.  So there I was.  I was at this dinner.
And he had just come from his--conservative on church doctrine--he'd
come from the South, had a fabulous record of doing things on civil
rights.
<p>
Boston was in the throes of one of its regularly scheduled
bits of racially motivated violence.  I asked him, `Your
eminence'--I think that was the right thing to call him--I said,
`Your eminence, here we have these two communities.  They're at each
other's throats.  People are dying.  Do you think there's any hope of
bringing these communities together, some kind of reconciliation?' And
he said, `Yes.  Yes, I do.' And I said, `Well, why?' And he said,
`Well, because I believe in the basic goodness of the human
spirit.' And I said, `Well, why?' And he--I was an assistant
professor, learning the Socratic method--you do these things,
right?  I said, `Well, why?' And he said, `I believe in the goodness
of the human spirit because I have faith.' And I started to
ask why.  And he said, `He saw'--he said, `Because Christ has risen.'
And he said it with a certain genial finality that let me know I
should stop because Christ has risen.
<p>
So I was thinking about this afterwards.  And I
was thinking, `OK.  Now where does one get faith of that sort if
you're not particularly religious?' Well, in religion, of course, 
there's this possibility of conversion.  He believed in
the possibility of redemption.  That's what he said, `Because I
believe in the possibility of redemption,' he said, and I said, `Why?'
And he said, `I believe in the possibility of redemption because
Christ has risen.' OK.  So redemption.  Why should we have
faith in the possibility of redemption?
<p>
There's some conversion experience that gives somebody religious
faith.  I don't think it is just a sermon.  I don't think it is a
legal brief.  There's something else that happens.  It seems to me
that the shift in values--this conversion, this transformation that
takes place is what we need to be about, with respect to racial and
ethnic justice--that is say what are the secular analogues of that
kind of transformative experience?  What are the secular
experiences?  What are the experiences of whatever sort
that will have a transformative effect on people's sense of community,
a transformative effect on people's sense of who is us and who is
them, because with that transformation comes the possibility of
bridging the gulf in perceptions and values.
<p>
Now this is not a totally weird idea.  I think everybody in the room
either has children or has been a child, right?  Parents do this all
the time--that is to say you self-consciously select experiences for
your child that you hope will shape their values, right--who they play
with, where they're going to school, the guitar lessons, the ballet
lessons, what they watch on television--whatever it is.  You pick
experiences to shape values.  We, in the civil rights movement, spend
our time writing legal briefs, by and large, these days and op-ed
pieces, rather than trying to figure out what are the transformative
experiences that will work now in the '90s--not the '60s, now in the
'90s--to have that transformative effect on people's sense of
community? <p>

So I was talking to a bunch of Episcopal ministers, and they
said, `We do great things in soup kitchens.' And I said--no pun
intended--`God bless you.  I think charity is terrific, not enough of
it.  I'm all for charity.  But I don't think that's going to provide
the kind of transformative experience that will reshape somebody's
sense of community.' I just don't.  For there's a hierarchical
quality of serving across the table that doesn't accomplish what I
think is likely to be the point, the purpose.  I mean, maybe Habitat
for Humanity is the kind of experience that does it, maybe political
activity around a shared problem.  Let's fix our schools for every
child, right?  Let's get rid of the toxic waste dump that's poisoning
our water.  Let's elect a candidate, whatever.  Let's repeal Prop
209--excuse me.
<p>
That's the
question:  What are the transformative experiences?  Now let
me close by talking about the president again. I was a very
strong proponent of the national conversation thesis when I worked at
the White House.  Then I left.  And I concluded that that was all
wrong, that that was all wrong.  I didn't think that Bill Clinton
would do it, could do it, that any political leader could do it, in
part because talking about race necessarily almost inevitably means
you're going to piss off--Am I allowed to say that?--that you're
going to upset 40 percent of your audience.
<p>
And as it turns out, most political leaders, be they presidents of
countries or presidents of universities--presidents of countries,
presidents of universities would just as soon avoid topics guaranteed
to upset 40 percent of the audience.  You'd rather talk about
something else.  There's no shortage of subjects.  Once in a while
they do it anyway.  It's called leadership with a capital L.  But
that's a different session, all right?  That's called leadership.
When it happens, we applaud, we write books about it, but it's not a
reliable strategy.  It's not a reliable strategy.
<p>
Secondly, it turns out many of these leaders are busy.  You know,
there's race, yes, but there's also Bosnia and so forth and so on.  So
the sustained conversation and attention to this required by the
complexity of the subject makes it difficult to figure out what he can
do on Saturday and thereafter.  Third problem is it's so damned hard.
It's so damned hard.  Context matters so much, nuance matters so much.
Platitudes can be not only unhelpful, they can be poisonous.  Working
through the media, the possibility of sustained engagement on a
complicated issue--daunting.  I'm sure Paul Taylor will talk about
that issue later on.
<p>
So here's what I think.  I believe that the president must engage
in a process that has five elements:  First, relentless
teaching--relentless teaching about where America is on race.
<p>
UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  Present.
<p>
EDLEY:  You think that's funny.  Relentless teaching about where
the president is-- about where the country is on race,
speaking authoritatively about it; secondly, relentless teaching about
the ways in which color poisons our consideration of a variety of
policy problems.  Expose it, deal with it constructively.  And in
doing so, model for the nation how to wrestle with these difficult
value divisions.  We're not good at it.
<p>
Third, he needs to tell us his vision of racial and ethnic justice in
the 21st century, and he needs to explain that vision and explain why
his vision is preferable to alternative visions, clarity and moral
teaching.
<p>
Fourth, he needs to look around the country and identify those
examples of leadership and those programmatic examples that to him
represent the promising paths towards achieving that vision:  What
should the federal government do?  What should the president of the
University of Pennsylvania do?  What should the pastor of the local
church do?  What works and why?  How to make progress towards that
vision concretely?
<p>
And fifth and finally, he needs to recruit and sustain and nourish
leaders.  He cannot do this alone.  He needs people like the folks in
this room to exercise leadership.  When I give speeches on this
subject around the country, I am struck by how hungry people are for
help in figuring out how to address problems of race.  They know it's
hard and they don't know what to do.
<p>
Last story and then I'll close:  I gave a talk about a year ago to a
group of minority officers at the Central Intelligence Agency.  It was
not a huge group, but  there we were.  We were at a covert
military facility in Virginia.  I could tell you where it is, but I'd
have to kill you all.  And after talking with them about affirmative
action and their various views and pushing them, `Well, what about
this and what about that, and what about this car--kind of argument?
What would you say about this,' and pushing them for about 45 minutes
in Socratic style.
<p>
I stopped and said, `Wait.  Wait.  Stop.  You all are
terrible at this.  You're terrible.  I mean, I wouldn't want any of
you representing my side of this argument at a cocktail party,
terrible.' `Why?' `Well, one reason I think you're terrible at this is
because you haven't practiced.  This is very difficult.  You haven't
practiced doing it.  If you're like me, most of the time when somebody
comes up to me to talk about a very complicated issue like this or
like abortion, I try to change the subject.  I mean, I'm
tired.  Life is hard and then you die.  And I'd just as soon
change the subject.  Thank you.'
<p>
Instead, when we talk about the subject, we usually do it with people
who are relatively like-minded.  We engage in what I call choir
practice, right?  We practice our melodies.  We practice our
harmonies.  And it just sounds so good, feels so good.  It's
great, choir practice.  And instead what we need to be doing is
missionary practice, figuring out how to talk to people whose values
and experiences are different, figuring out how to build a connection
to peoples whose experiences and whose communities are different from
ours.
<p>
So the fifth and final thing that Bill Clinton has to do, in speaking
to the nation about this issue over the next year and ultimately in
writing a report, is he has to recruit leaders and he has to give
leaders the tools with which to be effective missionaries.  I'm done.
Questions, or comments?  I should--yes, sir.
