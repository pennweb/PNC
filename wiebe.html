Ms. JUDITH RODIN: Good morning, and
welcome to the 5th plenary meeting of the Penn National Commission on
Society, Culture and Community.  I'm Judith Rodin, president of the
University of Pennsylvania, and the commission's convener.
<p>
Penn National Commission was formed to examine what seemed to many
observers to be an explosion of public intolerance and incivility in
our public discourse.  We think that one of the most important
contributors to that phenomenon may have been the breakdown and
fragmentation of our communities in the United States and around the
world.  And we've come to the Getty Center in Los Angeles to explore
the notion of community in the 21st century.  Our surroundings in this
beautiful facility could not be more modern and more appropriate.
<p>
To set the stage for our later discussions on community, we turn first
this morning to the context of public discourse, particularly the
extraordinarily changing boundaries between public and private.  This
is an issue that's been widely discussed in recent months, and
certainly this week's events in Washington will no doubt be a
touchstone for our conversation.
<p>
To lead our first session, I'm delighted to introduce Robert Wiebe,
who is professor emeritus at Northwestern University, the author of
many distinguished works, including <u>The Search For Order</u>, <u>The
Segmented Society</u> and most recently <u>The Opening of American
Society</u>. Bob is currently finishing <u>Self-Rule:  A Cultural History
of American Democracy.</u> He will be joined by an exceptionally diverse
and interesting panel and so, let me turn this over to Bob.  Thank
you.
<p>
ROBERT WIEBE:  As an introduction to this morning's meeting, it
seems worthwhile to recall the first problem that the commission's
deliberations identified:  How to reconcile Judith Rodin's initial
plea for public civility, and Joyce Appleby's immediate warning that
civility has a way of masking exclusions.  Here it is again in the
uneasy joining of the two halves of our meeting's title.  Although
enriching the conversation may also suggest deepening its rational
content, its primary associations for me are expansive:  diversifying
the participants, enlarging the agenda, welcoming new points of view.
Community in any century, on the other hand, is
regulative -- determining membership, containing differences, defining
responsibilities.
<p>
At the extremes, all of us want both openness and orderliness.  Who
likes apartheid?  Who chooses chaos?  Hence the impulse to seek common
ground between them.  Conversations also require boundaries.
Communities also need ways to expand.  Perhaps thoughtful insiders
speaking in behalf of voiceless outsiders will enlarge the community
through an effective system of representation.
<p>
But no matter how hard we shove the halves of our title together, they
continue to sit sullenly side by side.  Outsiders clamoring to join
the conversation tend, first of all, to disrupt communities.  As Ronald
Dworkin reminds us, genuinely free speech matches expression to
feelings.  If insiders do not find ways of talking with the intruders,
it's everybody to the barricades.  Strengthening community becomes a
euphemism for defending it.
<p>
The potential of representation to enlarge a community depends on
reciprocity.  When people of education and wealth let Spanish-speaking
hotel workers represent their interests, they establish a democratic
claim to represent the interests of Latino laborers.  A vulgarized
golden mean -- "let's not move too far in any direction" -- is certainly
no
solution.  Among other things, it implies that we already know where
we are.  On the contrary, our first task is to identify where the
crucial deficits in civil society lie.  At least in the short run, new
efforts at widening access are likely to disrupt community and new
commitments to control conduct are likely to constrict it.  How do we
position ourselves?
<p>
Historical perspective offers another way of getting our bearings this
morning.  You knew that was coming.  Lie down with an historian and
you get up scratching your head over the past.  On the counts that
most distress commentators today, the level of political discussion
has risen substantially since the United States' first century when
charges of treason, conspiracy, corruption and deception buzzed
incessantly around America's leaders.  During much of the 19th
century, public officials routinely threatened one another with
violence, and newspaperman routinely carried pistols.  And yes, sex
was fair game.  My favorite is the election of 1828, when Andrew
Jackson was pilloried for wedding a married woman.  And in a wondrous
flight of fancy, John Quincy Adams was accused of pimping for the
Russian czar.
<p>
But historical checklists have very little value.  What matters are
the patterns.  Savagery and national politics declined as the
significance and stature of the national government rose.  Political
discussion achieved a new plateau of decorum, some would say
rationality, during the progressive period early in the 20th century,
then reached its peak with a repudiation of McCarthyism about 50
years later.  By contrast to the brutality of authoritarian rule, the
hallmarks of democratic government were said to be muted discord and
quiet compromise.  Although presidents, assuming responsibility for
economic welfare, social justice and national security, profited the
most, a wide range of other officials benefited as well.  Circles of
silence buffered leaders from unwanted publicity.  
<p>
Trust in
government underwrote privacy in government.  Sometime between the
mid-1960s and mid-1970s, that moment of special deference passed
beyond recall.  With growing skepticism and suspicion came greater
scrutiny, and layer by layer the insulation protecting public
officials unraveled.  By and large, the lower the faith, the wider the
lens of publicity.
<p>
Today, many commentators still draw their norms of civility from this
unique mid-century moment.  Starting there, the story necessarily
becomes one long lament of decline with no end in sight.  Nobody knows
how to repair the Humpty-Dumpty of public trust.  We may hope to bore
people out of their minds with the sex lives of the mighty, but not to
recap the bottle of voluntary silence.
<p>
Concentrating on losses in civility weakens our attention to gains.
Delegitimizing a century's-old language of racism and sexism and
devising public forms of respect for the disabled to cite two
examples.  Above all, tenacious old norms complicate the commission's
challenge to imagine and facilitate a vital new public life.
<p>
The historian's second introductory lesson seeks to inter forever and
ever the myth of the stable, small communities that soulless
industrial forces destroyed.  Except in the back waters, those
communities simply did not exist.  During the years when most
Americans lived in and around small towns, opportunity-seekers rushed
through them at astonishing rates.  It was common for towns in the
19th century to show no more than a 10 percent persistence, decade to
decade.  I cannot overemphasize how good that news is.  Rather than
mourn the passing of static family clusters, we have reason to cheer
democracy's traditional reliance on what people carried with them as
they moved and moved again.
<p>
Then and now, democracy's best social capital has been invested in
mutual funds, associations that routinely welcome a flow of new
members and bid as many others farewell without sacrificing the
group's continuity.  What has held America's heterogeneous society
together is not so much a common culture as a common acceptance of
decisions in which many diverse parties have participated.  Notice how
compatible this is with Judith Rodin's exciting vision of multiple
centers of discourse sharing civic space in a multicultural society.
<p>
The relation of private to public life provides a final theme for our
considerations.  Here again, hand-wringing is less useful than
situating ourselves.  What requires special bolstering, and why?  For
almost half a century, an impressive line-up of social critics have
argued the impoverishment of the public at the expense of the private.
Endless repetition may deceive us into thinking these are self-evident
concepts when, in fact, they are unusually elusive.  In the
commission's deliberation, for instance, communities, as agents
of a healthy, public life, appear to be natural allies of the state.
For other populations around the world, on the contrary, communities
serve not as adjuncts to the state but as alternatives to it.
Perhaps many Americans have been inching in that direction without
our recognizing it.
<p>
As another example, private, contrary to common usage is not a
cultural default consisting of everything left over from public life;
it is a consciously constructed sphere.  In my adult lifetime, no
movements have mattered more than those among people of color and
white women to free their vital concerns from what they consider a
private prison.  When those concerns do hit the public light, little
wonder their champions phrase them as rights, absolute guarantees
against a return to private invisibility.
<p>
Kenneth Starr, in other words, did not make the private political.  It
has never been otherwise.  Whether we think his political use of
private affairs contributes to a dangerous trend may depend on the
role we assign character as a qualification for high office.  Would
those who dismiss telephone sex have the same reaction to obsessive
gambling or family abuse?  Certainly, nothing chills the heart of an
unreconstructed Democrat faster than the thought of a quasi-sacred
aura surrounding the presidency.
<p>
So much for the warm-up.  Now for the main event.  Our four speakers
this morning leave me in some awe at the extraordinary breadth of
their interest.  Have you glanced at these biographical sketches?
Well, if you have not, let me, at least very, very briefly in the
order in which they will appear, introduce:  Jonathan Franzen, at the
end of the table, author and essayist on all manner of contemporary
social and cultural subjects, ranging from the Postal Service to pulp
sex and now at work on his third novel.  Edward Rothstein, cultural
critic whose columns in The New York Times probably 90 percent here
have read.  Just think, he has done graduate work in social thought,
English literature and mathematics.  Match that.  At least hints at
the breadth of his knowledge.  Richard Weisberg, professor of
constitutional law, has written extensively on the place of law in
literature and has added a word to our vocabulary, "poethics," and has
authored a grim account of French complicity in the Holocaust.  Samuel
Popkin, participant in presidential elections since 1972, author of
<u>The Reasoning Voter</u>, which every presidential campaigner must now
read.  And he's even an expert on the Asian peasant societies.  And if
we're very nice to him, he may do his Ronald Reagan imitation.
<p>
Unidentified Man:  There you go again.
<p>
JONATHAN FRANZEN:  Hi.  Good morning.  I think I've been brought here to
talk about privacy, which I'll try to do in the 10 to 15 minutes
allotted to me.  Fifteen is a max max, we've been told, and I will try
to do well under that.
<p>
I come not as as an academic scholar of privacy but just
somebody who hears the word and thinks about it.  And I'd like to
start by asserting that privacy is a spongy, overused, ill-defined,
all-purpose, feel-good word that's especially popular with marketers.
And I was just noticing this morning in my hotel room that used to say
`Do Not Disturb,' but that wasn't a nice enough word, so we now have
`Privacy Please.' We all want our privacy.  If you stare hard at the
concept of privacy, try to figure out what it really is, what's
special and unique about the concept of privacy as opposed to liberty
or any number of other related concepts, you may find, as I do, that
it boils down to something like:  we have a visceral sense of
privacy, and I'm just going to put it out there, what my argument is.
<p>
We have a visceral sense of privacy of which we're most sensible when
its being threatened or violated.  It's as if each of us is equipped
with a sense of what's properly public and what's properly private,
and we feel a distress--many of us feel a distress, a sense of
invasion, when the boundary between those two worlds is breached.  And
to me, it seems that the issues that touch on this emotional distress
are the ones that are genuine privacy issues.
<p>
But there's a whole raft of issues that kind of have come
aboard, I think in part because privacy has picked up over the decades
this extraordinarily positive connotation in American discourse so
that questions about reproductive rights, gay rights, euthanasia, drug
testing, just to name a few obvious constitutional questions which
formerly might have been spoken of in terms of the liberal concept of
personal autonomy, of liberty, of Fourth Amendment, home is castle,
all of those things, now have come aboard the privacy train.  And
the problem, I think, is to isolate those genuinely--there is a
distress if your parent is dying in a hospital and a team of
six physicians barge in and perform extraordinary measures.
There's a sense that something bad has happened there.
<p>
But many of the issues that get discussed and cited in the current not
quite hysteria but extreme and exaggerated concern about the
state of American privacy don't really, it seems to me, involve harms
to that sense of person that I'm talking about or that sense of what
is appropriately in the left column, what is appropriately in the
right column, so that we talk about electronic privacy or genetic
privacy in addition to the right to privacy which comes up
in something like Roe v.  Wade.  And there--of course,
there's reason to be concerned when employers can gain access
to our medical records or strangers can get hold of our credit card
information, but the harm's in -- I would say -- really the
very substantial majority of such cases are concrete harms, like
workplace discrimination, fraud, theft, stalking and so forth.  And
that is all getting called privacy, and I think it obscures what
is essential about privacy, and it's why I admire the European
activists who prefer to speak of data protection rather than privacy.
<p>
I'm going fast.  I'm skipping over large portions of my argument,
which is contained in its entirety in a piece I did for <i>The New
Yorker</i>
a couple of months ago called "Imperial Bedroom," which I will cite
here.  What we have, then, is a situation where a large assortment of
largely unrelated harms is lumped together under the heading of
privacy infringement, the result being a widespread
perception that there is a crisis in privacy.  And this perception, in
turn, abets the notion--I'm really talking in the kind of the
popular imagination, the evening news imagination, more than very
astute observers' view, such as Dr. Wiebe's.
<p>
But this perception of a crisis in privacy does abet the notion that
the state of American privacy today is much worse than it was,
say, 100 years ago, which, again, I think anyone who has any
sense of history of the--you know, the large beds that the entire
family slept in, the one-room houses, the incredible
overcrowding, the lack of private transportation, the panoptical
surveillance by, you know, storekeepers and clergy.  It's
just a silly idea.  I mean, people live in enormous
houses.  Everybody has their own bedroom and bathroom and then drive
in, you know, these enormous kind of smoked-glass vehicles.  And
anonymity is extremely easily achieved, and it seems just
silly to say that we're getting so much worse in that regard.
<p>
Indeed, when you think about it, privacy, I think, is almost the
essence of contemporary transportation, residential architecture,
landscape, communications, mainstream political philosophy in the
United States.  And all of this, meanwhile, at a time when private
enterprise and the private sector have emerged as the unchallenged
models for the organization of society.  That is speaking broadly.  We
may challenge it here, but by and large, that's--those are the
principles according to which the country is increasingly organized.
And so I would submit that we're preoccupied with privacy because
privacy is all we've got and that our national distress about privacy
is, in fact, a kind of referred pain, that the real crisis consists in
the loss of the very notion of a public sphere as something to be
cherished and protected apart from the private.
<p>
I don't think ordinar Americans particularly care
that Monica Lewinsky's privacy was violated or that Bill Clinton's
privacy was violated.  What they care about, if anything, is the
violation of their own sense of an appropriate division between public
and private, which may be an artifact of the last century and, indeed,
there is perhaps no expectation that we can't--that there is this
division, but it's one that we're accustomed to and that, however
brief its life, appears, again, to be receding as the bedroom runs
rampant in Washington, DC, and privacy invades the last
bastion of a genuinely public world.
<p>
So that was a really rushed presentation of a somewhat more
complicated argument.  I'd like to insert two paragraphs, just read
straight from my own writing, because I think I write better than I
speak.  This is from the <i>New Yorker</i> piece.  `Walking up Third
Avenue
on a Saturday night, I feel bereft.  All around me, attractive young
people are hunched over their StarTacs and Nokias with preoccupied
expressions, as if probing a sore tooth or adjusting a hearing aid or
squeezing a pulled muscle.  Personal technology has begun to look like
a personal handicap.  What I really want from a sidewalk is that
people see me and let themselves be seen, but even this modest ideal
is thwarted by cell phone users and their unwelcome privacy.  They say
things like, "Should we have couscous with that?" And I'm on my way to
Blockbuster.  They aren't breaking any law by broadcasting these
dining conversations.  There's no publicity guard that I can buy,
no expensive preserve of public life to which I can flee.  Seclusion,
whether in a suite at the Plaza or a cabin in the Catskills, is
comparatively effortless to achieve.  Privacy is
protected as both commodity and right.  Public forums are protected as
neither.  Like old-growth forests, they're few and irreplaceable and
should he held in trust by everyone.  The work of maintaining them
gets only harder as the private sector grows ever more demanding,
distracting and disheartening.  Who has the time and energy to stand
up for the public sphere?  What rhetoric can possibly compete with the
American love of privacy?'
<p>
And one thing I'm trying to suggest here is that we're able to worry
about privacy because it so neatly fits the two models of social
behavior that still make sense to broad segments of the country, which
is, the consumer buys and the individual sues.  Privacy is
eminently--it works well with that, whereas a public space, it just
doesn't work at all.  You can't buy it.  You can't--an--and an
individual doesn't have a stake in it.  It's a collectively achieved
thing.  So that this seems to be one of those instances where liberal
democracy and free-market capitalism, which in most regards are very
happily married, indeed, find themselves utterly at odds.  And when
two otherwise friendly ideologies disagree without knowing it, the
result tends to be anxiety and distress and confusion.
<p>
The particular confusion about privacy arises, I think, from something
like an obsolescence or near obsolescence of our intellectual
apparatus.  The old distinction between private and public
still seems to make sense, you know, there's public.  There's TV
and there's private, there--you know, me in my bedroom.  But, in fact,
I don't think it's really adequate any longer to the description of
American reality.  On one side, we do still have our little spheres of
interiority and subjectivity, the feeling of privacy.  And these are
rugged little spheres which we maintain without much conscious effort
and which seem likely to survive as long as it's possible to have
experiences that don't have anything to do with making or spending
money.  On the other side, we have a desperately threatened public
world.  And in between these two worlds, we have an enormous,
cancerously expansive, market logic-driven, commercialized,
non-private, non-public no space which is kind of elbowing both worlds
out.
<p>
And it's this enormous thing in the middle, which will lead me to the
other paragraph I want to quickly read here, and then a quick
conclusion.  Since really serious exposure in public today is assumed
to be synonymous with being seen on television, it would seem to
follow that televised space is the premiere public space.  Many things
that people say to me on television, however, would never be tolerated
in a genuine public space, in a jury box, for example, or even on a
city sidewalk.  TV is an enormous, ramified extension of the billion
living rooms and bedrooms in which it's consumed.  You rarely hear a
person on the subway talking loudly about incontinence, but on
television, it's been happening for years.  TV is devoid of shame, and
without shame, there can be no distinction between public and private.
<p>
Last winter, an anchorwoman looked me in the eye and, in the tone of a
close female relative, referred to a litter of babies in Iowa as
`America's seven little darlins.' It was strange enough 25 years ago
to get Dan Rather's reports on Watergate between spots for Geritol and
Bayer aspirin, as if Nixon's impending resignation were somehow
situated in my medicine chest.  Now shelved between ads for Promise
margarine and Celebrity Cruises, the news itself is a soiled cocktail
dress, TV, the wardrobe, and nothing but.
<p>
So, in closing, I would like to say that it seems to me that--that one
of the big challenges that a group like this faces is how to if not
reframe the discussion then at least allow into the discussion of
public life and private life the idea that much of life for most
Americans nowadays can honestly be called neither public nor private.
Thanks.
<p>
BOB WIEBE:  Thank you.
<p>
EDWARD ROTHSTEIN:  I don't know if I'm going to be repeating things
that have been said in previous sessions or not, but we were given a
fairly free hand in designing these statements, so I'll take a
chance, and if this is repetitive, please forgive me.
<p>
How have we come to this peculiar moment when we have to even ask
questions about the relationship between public and private realms?
How is it that we are so uncertain about the boundaries of either?
And why does all this seem to be out of control--or, out of our
control?  Think of recent icons of our public life--Monica's dress,
pubic hair on a Coke can, a distinctive genitalia, date rape, condom
distributions, sexual harassment.  For widely varying reasons, these
icons of what would have once been determined to be private behavior
and private life have become issues of public concern.  At the same
time, issues of public concern, like education or transportation, are
becoming privatized, and debates about some public issues often end up
splintering into opposing relativistic stands, each marked by phrases
like, `You wouldn't understand,' essentially privatizing argument and
experience.  It is as if the public realm had at once expanded and
contracted, expanded to include issues once thought private and
contracted so that very little of substance really ends up
deserving the name `public.'
<p>
Meanwhile, the private has done the same, expanded so that there's no
escape from the confessions, the bare-all, therapeutic, tell-all
memoir, the recent assertions about personal prerogatives and rights,
and it's contracted so that nothing really of substance is left in the
private world.  We can argue that in expanding the public
scrutiny of things once thought private that we are actually--not
really doing anything other than becoming more sensitive, let's say in
considerations of date rape, doing anything more than becoming more
sensitive to once-suppressed private events, that there's a public
interest in--in this kind of scrutiny; that we are expanding rights,
eliminating a certain kind of puritanism, engendering another kind of
respect.
<p>
But at the same time that we define, say, something like date rape, we
also open up a whole other realm to scrutiny and to legal activity.
And we can end up, as this proceeds, becoming more puritanical rather
than less puritanical.  There's no simple consequence to
this kind of examination of public life--this kind of examination of
the private, however much public interest then may be in doing so.
The boundaries shift in part because we push at them.
<p>
In contrast, if we consider an instance of what we consider the
public overstepping its bounds into private life--for
example, the Starr report--the converse questions end up suggesting
themselves.  After all, we expanded the public realm to redefine the
notion--to define a notion of sexual harassment, which is, in a sense,
itself considered to be a violation of the private by the public.  We
have also made it a crime to perjure oneself in sexual harassment
cases; that is, to publicly take a stand violating the private
violation of a public realm.  So it probably should be no
surprise that the Starr report itself seems like a public violation of
a private realm caused, presumably, by violating a public trust.  I
have no simple answers to any of this, and there probably are none,
but it may be helpful at this point to define some of the boundaries
of private and public, coming at this question from another direction.
<p>
When we think of a society without a notion of private, with--lacking
a private realm, as we think about it, we tend to think of
totalitarian states, where every aspect of life is supervised and
regulated.  And in most extreme circumstances, where even the
relationships between the family become subject to the rule of
the state.
<p>
But there's another historical example of a society without our notion
of the private realm.  I'm thinking of a theocracy, or at least a
society that has agreed communally to govern itself according
to what is considered to be divine law.  In Judaism, for example,
there are traditions of privacy that develop during centuries of legal
interpretation and debate.  But in a more important sense, for those
who accept the regulations of divine law, there is no really
fully private realm.  There is no realm cut off from responsibilities
to the outside world or to the claims of that divine law.
<p>
And as in other religious legal systems, like Islam, every aspect of
one's life is meant to be conducted according to these regulations.
This extends even into the activities in the privy.  The
distinction in such a theocratic way of organizing society is not
between the public and the private but between the sacred and the
profane.  The sacred is meant to extend as far as possible and carries
in it many of the aspects of both--what we now consider to be both
public and private.  It is--the sacred is like the private because it
is meant to be inviolate, free from trespass by the profane, but it is
like the public because the recognition of the sacred actually creates
what we now call public; that is, binds the individuals into a
community.
<p>
When a religious society and a secular one meet, or evolve together,
conflicts arise in part because of the mixed nature of these
distinctions.  How does one render unto Caesar what is Caesar's?
One would first have to recognize Caesar's authority over some part of
the whole.  But by what right does Caesar trespass on the realm of the
sacred?  In a relatively homogeneous society, one solution is that the
sacred is incorporated in some way into public life, as a kind of
state religion.  Or else, as is now more common, it--the sacred
becomes increasingly identified with the private realm, the inviolate
world of the self that proclaims, `Don't tread on me.' This may even
be a source of some of our
notions of privacy; that is, we link it in some way to something like
the sacred, to the practice of rituals, to the holding of faith,
whatever that faith may be, political or religious or something else,
that owes nothing to Caesar's rule.
<p>
But what happens in societies like those of the West since the
enlightenment, when religious claims shrink even further?  We know
that as the modern state came into being, many of the feelings that
were associated with religion, the imperatives of the inner life, the
notion of a higher immaterial calling, the sense of a mission
demanding some sacrifice--these feelings often ended up becoming
associated with culture and with the creation of art.  This, in
romanticism, took the shape of the world of the individual becoming
almost sacred, that is this private realm -- what we now call
the private -- is the source of wisdom and enlightenment.  The state
could be an impediment to that sort of realization.  Maybe our
strong sense of opposition between public and private derives in part
from these kinds of sentiments.  After all, in a secular
universe, the demands of the public can begin to seem arbitrary,
willful -- by what source do they gain their authority? -- particularly in
contrast to what we consider to be the authentic self, the authentic
private realm.  The inner life can start to seem like the only guide
for shaping public life, and yet, the public demands much more.  In
fact, it demands precisely the opposite; that is, it claims this
heritage of the sacred under whose aegis the
individual pursues a sanctioned path.
<p>
And so these modern confrontations may have these roots; that is, this
is part of what I think we mean when we talk about civilization and
its discontents, except for one thing. I mentioned before that
perhaps art and culture, at a certain point in the West, began taking
over the role -- the place of religion and became the terrain of the
individual in modern society, as formed for self-expression,
self-representation.  But the matter is more complex, because
somehow, these two great monoliths, the state, say, and the
self, actually seem to meet in the ground of culture.  Their culture,
in some way, acts as a sort of mediator between them.  Culture, in the
broadest, modern sense, actually moves between the public and the
private, communicating issues of the private realm into the public,
translating demands of the public into the realm of the private.  And
this may even be what culture in the broadest sense is actually about.
Culture maps out the meanings of one realm to the other, bringing this
under our scrutiny.
<p>
Consider, for example, just very briefly the novel, with its
tales of private life which, in the debased sense, may have
evolved into something like tabloid journalism.  We have <u>Moll
Flanders</u>
and prostitution; <u>Pamela</u> and courtship; <u>Frankenstein</u> and
scientific
ambition; <u>Anna Karenina</u> and adultery.  These are some of the mythic
tales of Western civilization in which private sensations, intimate
chronicles, are brought into public view.  Culture speaks of the
private to the public.  But this is also a dialogue and perhaps even
something more profound.
<p>
How else are we to make sense, for example, of the public world of
musical performance once music is separated from its religious
foundations?  From C.P.E. Bach to Balleos to Mahler, the private and
public engage in an intricate sense of
conflict in negotiation.  This is really dramatized in the form of the
concerto, which was really, I think, an iconic representation
of certain ways of thinking about the relationship of the
individual to the larger society, demonstrating, dramatizing
what was at stake in these sorts of relationships, what material gets
passed back and forth when authority is asserted, when is--when it is
submitted.  And actually, one could probably analyze the evolution of
the concerto as a very interesting way of thinking about the
relationship between the solo and the communal.
<p>
There's also an aspect of culture which reinforces the public
claims on the private.  That is, there is a sort of retribution taken,
and we know this in the form of many sorts of tragedies--literary
tragedies, novelistic tragedies--where the price must be paid for the
violation of the public realm.
<p>
And you're right, one can select any number of examples.  I
mentioned <u>Anna Karenina</u> earlier. <u>The Mayor of Casterbridge</u>;
in the 20th
century, the dystopian novels, like <u>Brave New World</u> and
<u>1984</u>,
represent the public completely overwhelming the private.  And, in
fact, I guess, one of the final turns, if I'm remembering
correctly, in <u>1984</u> is, one knows that the public has won when the
private betrays itself to the public. I think at the very end,
there is an act of private betrayal that becomes a sign of the
victory of the public.
<p>
So I would say that culture in this broadest sense is about
the relationship between the public and the private, possibly because
it still somehow bears in it the aura of the sacred, transcending any
secular Caesarean boundaries.  And shifts in culture can either--can
seem to cause tremors in public-private relations and they also
reflect them.  And this is very hard to separate.  But if culture is
skewed towards--as
I've argued, towards private preoccupations, then art becomes weighed
down with confession and self-display, and politics can turn into gossip.
If culture is skewed toward the public
realm, then art can veer toward bombast or jingoism and politics can
turn into ideology.  And obviously, we now, in contemporary society,
have quite a bit of both.  Private life is politicized.  Public life
is rife with private passions.  And culture, which even despite its
sort of hint of the sacral, can become mass entertainment.  So what is
to be done?  This is one of the questions I was interested in hearing
about at these meetings.
<p>
WIEBE:  Thank you.
<p>
RICHARD WEISBERG:  It's not just to ingratiate myself potentially
with an audience that are largely not lawyers that I suggest drawing
on my legal and literary background as subtitle for my remarks today,
and that's "the first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers."  Because
I want to suggest that an institution that perhaps we haven't looked
at carefully enough, shares some of the blame for an unease that
many of us feel in developments in public discourse lately is the law.
<p>
On the other hand, I want to suggest with a certain irony that if we
look to traditional models of legal thinking, including constitutional
models connected to the framing generation and the First Amendment, we
may be able to improve the situation that most of us here are trying
to work on.  My own trajectory into this topic began, like the
Commission's, before anybody had heard of Monica Lewinsky, when I was
applying for a series of grants to research the topic, up from the
privatization of our public discourse.  Then Monica came along, and I
wrote a piece that you have in your voluminous materials called
Monica's Stars and Stripes.  That was kind of a funny piece that was
written out in the Hamptons on July 4th.  The issues have gotten
considerably more serious.  They were always serious, but what's
happening either today or tomorrow or Monday tells us that we are in a
grave constitutional crisis, very, very complex, and one that
implicates, I think, just about every issue that we're trying to
discuss at these meetings.
<p>
To show that I don't think that my subtitle is a fair appraisal,
however, of what our profession offers, I also wanted to, in a sense,
dedicate the more formal part of my remarks to Leon Higginbotham, who
I believe was on the Commission, and whose last public
performance before his tragic death a couple of days ago was before
the House Judiciary Committee, in which he expressed in his inimitable
way, full of both passion and reason, his incredulity that a
President's refusal to confess to a private impropriety for which
nothing in the American system of jurisprudence had given him warning
that it might be investigated, could rise to the level of high crimes
and misdemeanors.  But in thinking through -- over this period and up
through Higginbotham's remarks and others that I followed from my
colleagues in the law and from other professions, it began to occur to
me that what needed to be discussed was the very difficult question of
truth.  Where does truth fit in here?  Not necessarily epistemological
or moral or theological conceptions of truth, although I think they're
all related and I think my colleagues have already, in some respects,
hit on this, but a model of truth telling in American civic discourse.
<p>
And I want to just briefly outline what I consider to be a dichotomy
that has arisen, I think fairly recently, but probably it's cyclical
in nature, between what I call the quest for literal truth,
regardless of subject matter, and an older model of public discourse
which I call civic truth-speaking.  And I'll be contrasting this model
of literal truth-seeking with civic truth-speaking in the 10 or 12
minutes left to me.
<p>
It does seem to me that the quest for literal truth, whatever the
subject matter of that quest, seems to be a non-starter for American
public discourse, although I'm starting my remarks with this.  We are
not so much in a period, it seems to me, of special incivility.  In
fact, incivility has a revered place in our discourse.  We are in a
period of mass passivity, of almost complete astonishment at the
subject matter of current political discourse.  The idea has not
caught on with the general public, although it seems to have
married such disparate types as Kenneth Starr and the elite media,
that whatever someone decides to look into, whatever the goal of the
inquiry, uncovering and publicizing its literal truth is somehow
automatically a public good.  And I say this with--very much with
deference to Robert and many others who recognize that the
introduction of character--and I'm really not discussing that
centrally today, but I know we have that in mind--the introduction of
the discussion, the character of our public leaders, is not
always baleful and may very well, as you've suggested, have a positive
effect on the discourse, although I'd like to discuss it a little more
with you, particularly given your hypotheticals about gambling and
drinking.
<p>
One might, for example, suggest that--supposing instead of looking
into either the sexual habits of our leaders or, let's say, gambling
or drinking, if that should arise, supposing there were an inquiry
that just arose into, for example, the religious beliefs and practices
of our leaders.  This is typically a very private realm.
You've referred to it, though.  It definitely it has a public
aspect in our culture.  We expect our presidents to go to church every
Sunday, typically.  We have had very difficult discussions of the
connection between religious faith and high political office.  And
those certainly have not been totally quieted.
<p>
But supposing someone just decided that he would inquire into the
religious practice of a leader and discovered certain hypocrisies or
certain inconsistencies.  And it undoubtedly wouldn't be hard to do,
any more so than if one looked into the sexual peccadillos of
certain individuals, maybe all individuals, it wouldn't be hard to
find something.  Well, all of a sudden, that's in the middle of public
discourse.  That's not necessarily a good.  And the literal
truth-seeking that would follow in that direction, which may lead to
some lying, prevarication, frustration, obfuscation--particularly if a
lawyer is doing all of those things, it can sometimes be done very
artfully--isn't necessarily something that automatically is I would
say even blameworthy, much less rises to the level where we are right
now in terms of high crimes and misdemeanors.
<p>
What we do know is that literal truth-seeking in the present
environment has not captured the imagination of the American public,
and we have lost to American discourse a good majority of the citizens
in this country.  And I think that that may have less to do with
incivility or with other factors--and there are many that are
involved--than with a kind of, `What's this all about?  Why are we
spending so much time on this?  This can't be right.  This isn't what
we should be discussing as a polity.' I feel that lawyers have a
responsibility, as everyone does within his or her own field, to
assert competing notions of public discourse.  And fortunately for
constitutional lawyers--and there are a few in our midst here, and
there won't be complete agreement as to the account I'm about to give,
but there might be substantial agreement--there's already, at the
heart of our republic, a tradition of public participation and
discourse that maintains a certain private space and directs citizens
not towards literal truth but instead towards what I want to call
provisionally civic truth.
<p>
Civic truth can be and has been defined throughout our history as a
process, increasingly inclusive of all citizens, and that--that little
subordinate clause--people on this commission and people in our polity
have had to work on to become included.  So it's just a subordinate
clause that covers an enormous amount of work.  But I believe the
process has become increasingly inclusive.  And the process is
designed to reach the truth, a process dignified by the mutual choices
we make as to what constitute important public issues.  Part of the
process of public conversation in this country is a decision made by
individuals involved in the conversation as to what counts as
important public issues.  These issues are never fixed, but
Americans seem to have a pretty good idea that they involve our public
responsibilities at home and abroad.  In its paradigm, civic truths
involve constant debate, constant conversation.
<p>
The model is one of civic truth-speaking more even than civic
truth-seeking.  Isn't so much that we ever feel--and this is very much
in the tradition, as others will speak about and have written about so
well for the two days that bring us together here--very much in the
liberal tradition, beginning with Milton, John Stuart Mill, Holmes,
the notion that it's a multiplicity of voices.  Well, what happens, as
in the current environment, when those voices are quieted, not through
any, I think, tyranny or any deliberate impulse on the part of leaders
or others to quiet voices, although there may be a little bit of that
in a strange way, but just because the subject matter that has arisen
strikes people really as being not worth a
candle?
<p>
The literal truth seekers differ from the civic truth speakers in
almost every relevant respect, it seems to me.  The source of their
legitimacy, for example -- and Edward has asked already a little bit
about --what are the sources for claims of important public
discourse?  Where do we find the roots of what someone might say is
important compared to what isn't important?  And I think there are
such sources, there are such roots.  The focus of the
conversation--the sense each side has a public and private space.
<p>
For the literal truth-seeker, public and private subject matters are
increasingly conflated, while conversely -- and I think this is
important, I can't do much with it, but others have, I think,
already here, or will continue to do this. While the subject matters
between public and private are increasingly conflated, an increasing
distinction is drawn between the speakers themselves.  That is, the
status of individuals who are deemed worthy of commenting on these
issues is bifurcated.  That is, there are celebrities, there are
gurus, there are people--pundits, there are people in the business of
commenting on these things, and then there's the rest of the
population.
<p>
I think this is ironic and, of course, I'm overstating it because we
do have the Internet.  We do have--and have to be thinking about a
kind of process of democratization.  I don't think we know very much
about what's going on all over the Net--that would seem to speak
against what I just said, yet I think you might think
through that model, generally speaking, of a conflation of public and
private subject matter contrasted with what I feel to be an
increasing bifurcation of those who are permitted to speak, those who
are listened to and all of the rest of the American population.  This
is not constructive for, I think, American notions of civic discourse.
<p>
The literal truth-seeker needs to unpack the presumptively false
public statements of anyone claiming to lead or even to spark a
debate on a key issue.  And this, I think, is very destructive.
You get the feeling that we've moved to the point where
confessional talk is acceptable and, in fact, it's almost the key
moment of any inquiry, is to get somebody to confess to something, and
its usually some private human failing.  Or from a private person,
it's the blazoning forth, as others have discusses on television, of
their own private worlds or, in private conversation, that moment when
people start to talk about their use of Viagra or other
purely private confessional moments.  We have this in
both spheres.
<p>
Public pronouncements of positive policy leadership are distrusted.
The idea is, as you look at someone, maybe making some good points, we
think in the current environment, or we tend to, `Well, what really
makes that person tick?' Certainly not what he or she is saying.
There's something underneath that that has to be gotten to before we
really can credit, much less follow, the pronouncements of that public
person.  That, I think, is a baleful outgrowth of what I call the
tendency towards literal truth-seeking.
<p>
I think that the civic truth speaker is really interested in the ideas
that are being generated.  They don't have to be purely rational.
They can be -- like Higginbotham -- they can be a combination of
narrative, of emotion.  I don't see any distinction between narrative
and rational, logical discourse.  Rhetoric is good rhetoric.  There's
always a combination of both.  But there is some faith projected
towards the statement made and its potential validity.  We don't
necessarily accept it.  In fact, we're supposed to debate it.  We're
supposed to criticize it.  We're supposed to find the holes in it.
But we're not constantly looking through to see what the private
individual, who is making this statement, in fact, is like -- as though
that were the most important end result of our reception of that
individual's remarks.
<p>
I just want to turn -- because I only have a minute or two left--to
some topics that really already have been taken up by my colleagues.
I think that another baleful result of what I call literal
truth-seeking is a result on culture.  And as we increasingly dominate
our public conversation with what have traditionally been considered
private matters, we are
not only projecting a model of fairly trivial but true confessional
discourse in our public discourse, in our public domain; we are also
taking from culture precisely those elements that I think were
paradigmatically theirs -- that is, explorations of what is much more
difficult to understand, much more complex, much more fearful--human
sexuality--matters that, indeed, have been masterfully handled
traditionally through the medium of cultural discourse.
<p>
I saw Tom Wolfe, who I like very much, on the air the other day about
his new novel, and he introduced it at a journalism school.  And it's
not uncommon of excellent, recent novelists who adopt a model really
of journalism, or in the case of E.L.  Doctorow--who lives out near me
in the Hamptons; is also on the Commission--the choice of historical
subjects, not that these are insignificant cultural artifacts and
modes of expression, but it is significant that the search for the
imaginative individual world is very often mediated on the stage these
days, and even in our best narrative through something else, something
historical, something journalistic, something, so to speak, that's
true.
<p>
What is the model that--in closing, that I think we can actually look
to?  Well, literal truth-seeking and a literal faith in language to
convey ideas is not something that I think the framing generation
believed in.  They really had in mind a constructed conversation of as
much civic participation as possible.  I know there'd be a little bit
of bickering, maybe, about this point, both historically and
otherwise, and there is even in the materials for the next panel.  But
I know that--from Federalist 37 that the framers did not believe in
the notion of a literally graspable language that we could rely on as
we go about our business of seeking the truth.  They said about the
debates on the ratification of the Constitution and how difficult it
was for each side to make their point--and I'll close on this--they
said the following about literalism.  `The use of words is to express
ideas.  Perspicuity, therefore, requires not only that the idea should
be distinctly formed but that they should be expressed by words
distinctly and exclusively appropriate to them.  But no language is so
copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea or so
correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas.'
<p>
I don't know if they had in mind the word `is,' but this is a
very important model.  And here comes the metaphor.  `Hence, it
must happen that however accurately objects may be discriminated in
themselves and however accurately the discrimination may be
considered, the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the
inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered.  And this
unavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less, according to the
complexity and novelty of the objects defined.' And they close as
follows, in typical late 18th century neo-classical style.  `When the
Almighty himself condescends to address mankind in their own language,
his meaning, luminous as it must be, is rendered dim and doubtful by
the cloudy medium through which it is communicated.'
<p>
Words are all that we have in public discourse.  We should relish the
fact that it is an imprecise medium that opens up the opinions of many
to the answers, to the sympathies or to the antipathies of others.
And this is how I think we move ahead in our public discourse.  Thank
you.
<p>
SAMUEL POPKIN:  I guess it falls to me to say some of the
good things about the current scandal and what we've learned in the
last year about public and private and the way things work in the age
of the Internet and where we're going as a polity.  And I
suppose it's appropriate to quote former governor of Louisiana Edwin
Edwards, who said, "The voters will forgive anything I do in my private
life as long as they don't find me with a live boy or a dead girl."
Every time you get--I've, in the past, been fortunate to study Bob
Wiebe's work -- because the turn of the century and the expansion of the
railroads and the telephone was a time when people had a lot of the
same fears they do now about how fast things were changing and
how everything was coarsening.
<p>
Every time you have a new media system, the fears become
overwhelming about how things will work out. I'm a
pollster, I confess, and voting studies really started out of concerns
about what radio would do to overwhelm us with Big
Brother.  And it's ironic that now, in the age of the
scandal, those of us who grew up violently criticizing the
shallowness of the 30-minute news broadcasts of the '70s and '80s are
longing for the days when 80 percent of the public watched a national
news show vs.  the 40 percent that regularly do so today as opposed to
all the other media.  But relevant to the discussion of public and
private, something we've seen that we didn't know about the public
during the year of the Monica is the extent to which people can
distinguish between political character and personal character.  This
is something I've always worried about.
<p>
Long before I ever heard of Bill Clinton or Gennifer Flowers, I wrote
in <u>The Reasoning Voter</u> that my biggest concern was the way in
which,
in the United States, people projected from the good character of
a person to the fact that he would be a good president.  And I was
concerned as a pollster for Jimmy Carter, with how many people said,
`Well, he's a good person, so he'll be a good president.' And
that scared me tremendously.  And I suppose if as
a Jew/secular, that the most rapidly growing part of the
population is not the fundamentalists but the 20 percent of us who are
ex-religious or non-Christian in some way.
<p>
Something that I find very encouraging for the future is that people
know the difference between a president and a role model.  So I don't
have to worry when Kenneth Starr becomes president or somebody Kenneth
Starr likes that I'll have to tell my kids not to think of them as a
role model. We've learned the difference between a
political leader and a role model.  And, in fact, at any one time
in this year, we have a situation where half the people in the country
have thought of the president as an excellent president and a bad
person or a bad person morally.  And they're able to hold these at the
same time and to make also, I think, the very important distinction
between sin and crime or similarly, the public and the
private.
<p>
Constant over this last year, from the beginning to the end,
whether the news was vivid and garish or rumors that we imagined the
content, two-thirds of the public have said this is a private
issue, not a public issue.  And there's even further distinctions that
people have made.  Several polls have asked people for which
occupations do you think adultery should render a person unfit to hold
the job, and at one extent, only 15 percent to 18 percent of the
people in this country think that if you're adulterous, you can't
serve as a CEO of a major corporation.  At the other extent, 70
percent of the people in this country think that if you're adulterous,
you should not be a rabbi or a minister.  So people clearly ma -- I
don't know if you'll be relieved or sad to find out that for
academics, it's only 25 percent to 30 percent.  You'll have to decide
whether that's good news or bad news.  And, interestingly, when asked
about the future and say, `How do we prevent scandals like this from,
you know, dominating our life in the future?' and offered the choice
between having better, purer, more upright candidates and having a
press that ignores private life, by over two to one, people say, `Have
a press that ignores private life.  Don't try and find a politics
of virtue for the political realm.' And I find that `don't ask,
don't tell' very encouraging.
<p>
And another important thing we've learned this year and we--this is
one we didn't know about, and it's been written about--John
Zowler here at UCLA wrote a wonderful piece 'The Contribution
of Monica Lewinsky to Political Science,' about some of the
findings that people have had to acknowledge.  One very important one
that we saw with the recent election, is that there is a very big
difference between issues that you like to talk about and issues that
you think are important--and having nothing but a constant Letterman,
Leno, barrage of cigar jokes, Linda Tripp jokes.  My favorite was on
Halloween when they said, `Lots of people have Bill and Monica masks.
You don't need to worry about them.  The people you need to worry
about are the ones with the Linda Tripp masks.  They go to the bedroom
window.'
<p>
Now this, again, says something about notions of privacy
and public.  And people talk about the Lewinsky thing probably
100 times as much as the other issues, but when people went to
vote, very clearly, exit polls and all those other forms of looking at
what people were thinking about, they thought much more about
education, Social Security and the standbys.  And, in fact,
where the Republican Party got in so much trouble was that the
emphasis on the scandal to satisfy their sense of principles and
showing us that they would ignore polls--and I wished they'd picked a
different time to do it, but one of the things that came out
very clearly was that people think that when you talk about scandal or
you talk about somebody's shortcomings, it's a smoke
screen for not talking about issues.
<p>
Now I was originally asked to be here to be in Andy Kohut's circuit,
because given the pecking order in Washington, I can leave town for a
half a day, Andy can't leave town for an hour this week.  And Andy--I
was pleased to work with Andy on some very important work on studying
distrust.  Ever since the famous 'malaise' speech and Jimmy
Carter's communing with Christopher Lasch and other distinguished
thinkers to think about what we could do about the growing distrust of
government, there's been concern.  One of the easy answers
for anything is, either people don't vote because they don't trust
government or people don't vote because we have Tweedledum and
Tweedledee parties with no differences between them.  And I've worked
with Andy on a lot of work, at polls and done research of my own, and
I can say both of these analyses of why people don't vote are empty.
They've become ritualistic explanations.
<p>
The simple fact is, levels of distrust of government are
much higher in Europe than they are in the US, and voting rates are
higher in Europe than they are in the US.  The big difference in--is
that, in fact, in this country, we have so many elections so much of
the time, and the number of choices confuses many people.  What we
have that only Switzerland and Japan have, of all the modern
industrial democracies, is a turnout gradient where the highly
educated vote much more than the lower educated.  The fact is,
it's not people who are looking at the political parties and rejecting
them or who don't trust government who don't vote; it's the people who
can't figure out the complexities of the federal division of power system.
So you get the same kinds of turnout differences between the highly
educated and the less educated here that you've had in Japan and
Switzerland, the other two complicated systems.
<p>
In fact, the top seventh of this country in education, the 15 percent
of Americans with advanced degrees, produce more votes on Election Day
than the third of Americans who have not finished high school.  That
means, by the way, that this commission can have an enormous power
whether or not it ever reaches the rest of the country.  One of
the --when I read the commission
documents, I see that we talk about overcoming divisions of race and
class and gender, the dirty word `religion' isn't mentioned in the
documents.  I referred to it earlier.  One out of five Americans
has nothing to do with churches.  They are not even a Christmas
and Easter Christian.  You know, they have nothing to do with
Christianity.  They're secular or they're a very small minority
religion, like Judaism or Buddhism.  That group, by the way, which
has, you know, enormous overlap with the educated class, surprise,
surprise, is the group, just for the record, that if they didn't vote,
there would never be a Democratic president in the country, should
such mundane partisan matters be of interest to you.
<p>
Let me say one last thing about trust and turnout.
Whereas social trust has little or nothing to do with who votes or how
turnout goes up and down over time, the feelings of trust in
government and trust in people around us have a lot to do with the
policy choices we make when we do vote.  When social trust is high,
people are less nervous about immigration, foreign trade,
foreign aid or involvement in the world.  When social trust is low,
people are much more negative and concerned about people away from
their group.  It's when people feel the distrust around them.  If you
want to get people more involved and engaged in the world, get the
squeegee people off the streets.  Really follow the 'broken windows,'
Giuliani approach because the one thing we know about social
trust is that having dangerous places that you go by every day
predicts very well over time how much trust or distrust there is in
the society.  And that those kinds of trusts have a lot to do not
with whether you participate but whether you want a government based
on trust or a government of a police state based on high levels of
distrust.  It's not whether you participate but whether you want us to
be erecting barriers or putting down barriers between our kind and the
rest of the world that trust affects.  I'll stop there.
<p>
WIEBE:  Thanks, all four of you.  And now it's yours.  I think we might be
well-served if we ask questions
rather than made speeches.  Not very civil of me after having made a
short speech.  But I think if we ask questions, we can probably
elicit the best from our panel.  So if there are people who have
things on their mind--questions on their mind.
<p>
Yes, Kathleen.
<p>
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON:  I wonder about the use of the--the phrase
`literal truth'
in an environment in which Clinton's defense is that he told the
literal truth and wonder if there isn't a better word for `literal' to
capture your meaning.
<p>
POPKIN:  Can I say one sentence about that?  If Bill Clinton
gets away--get-- does very well with the public because they can
distinguish between the public and the private, one fact that kills
him over and over is that nobody in the public, outside of the
lawyering class, believes there is anything different between lying
and perjury.  Nobody in America will believe in their gut that there
should be a difference between them.
<p>
WEISBERG:  I wonder if I could take a shot at that, and it's a
very good comment.  The phrase `literal truth seeker' and
`civic truth speaker'--they are provisional phrases, but I think
there's a real difference between literalism as it's commonly
understood, and maybe here a religious model might be important to
use.  That is, that there is a use of language that, in an unmediated
way, gets through to the listener.  And what Clinton admittedly--a
brand of literalism is really arguing, which is--I would argue
more of a deconstructive, heavily contextualized notion of the
fluidity of language.  Now it comes out as--and it's been used, I
guess, with success by the Republicans on the committee, it can
be attacked as a form of literalism or, what's even worse, legalism,
even though most of them are lawyers and they're using language in
very similar ways, too.  So I appreciate your suggestion.
I think it'll take a little more work, but we still might wind
up defining it better with that adjective.
<p>
WIEBE:  I would like to ask the panel where they find leverage
for change.  I--I hear a good deal about each person's sense of
distress in what he finds and very little encouraging the
commission--at least by implication, encourage the commission to
believe that we might be able to find some levers to change these
deeply cultural flaws that you've examined.
<p>
FRANZEN:  I'm not so sure I think that things are so broken.
I gue...
<p>
WIEBE:  Just on the streets of New York.
<p>
FRANZEN:  Streets of New York--well, we all, in New York,
have mixed feelings about the mayor, but when I was doing this piece
in October, I was returning at seven in the evening every night
throughGrand Central, which is newly renovated, and
the extraordinary beauty of a city that works,
especially growing up in the suburbs, I just--I dreamed of a city.
And that city exists and it works pretty well, whatever--I mean, you
know, I don't like the attitude of the cops, but, um -- so --this is
quickly to clarify that one can sort of voice distress, but it's--you have
to
put it in context, it's a pretty great country.  And...
<p>
Dr. WIEBE:  Good;  anybody else with levers in mind
if--or the lack of need for them?  Yes.
<p>
WEISBERG:  I think that our law of libel is another part of my
project this year, oand I won't bore you, although, I
think fortunately, most of you will be familiar with at least the
first case that I'll mention, and that's New York Times vs.  Sullivan,
which I think is one of the two or three great cases out of the
Supreme Court in the 20th century, which held that, essentially,
someone criticizing government can be sued by that government official
only with the greatest difficulty.  It was a wonderful decision
drawing on the very tradition of civic discourse that I was alluding
to today.  And the encouraging of discussions of government on
the broadest level, even when, literally, erroneous and even when
defamatory, would be protected.
<p>
But in answer to your question, it seems to me that rapidly, after
Times vs.  Sullivan, the Supreme Court went off in areas that, in my
view, are directly responsible for the relatively impoverished
discourse we see today.  They expanded the rule to celebrities, public
figures, so that somehow, public figures and celebrities and talk
about them was deemed as important as talk about our governments--talk
about government leaders.  I liked the decision when it first came
out.  Most  people did.  Now I'm not so sure it was such a good
move.
<p>
And Goetz, 10 years after Times vs. Sullivan, which I think
completely overturned the civic lesson of Times by dividing us into
public and private people and creating a disincentive for public--for
a private person to speak out about public issues because when that
happens, you risk becoming a public figure who has the difficulties of
proving reputational harm if, indeed, someone chooses to say something
against you--a very, very bad, in my opinion, decision.
<p>
So one of the--I don't if the commission wants to get into all of
this, but I think in addition to the disciplines that already have
been brought to bear here, perhaps there could be some focus--I think
that maybe there already has--on work involving very influential
decisions by the Supreme Court, which I think do have an effect on the
way people converse in the country.
<p>
ROTHSTEIN:  I guess I would come at this question maybe
from--trying to think about in what ways we can create or constitute a
public right now.  And I think there's a problem.
I--take as one example the creation of the euro in Europe,
which is very interesting sort of phenomenon, because now, for the
first time, you have a -- I think for the first time, you have an
attempt to create a different kind of public, first by changing the
financial apparatus rather than by doing anything as far as the people
is concerned; that is, you create a public by somehow having
their interactions centralized.  I'm very curious as to
what's happened, but I think what--what's going to end up
happening -- what's happened already is very peculiar, because
what you have is, in the design of the currency itself, which
won't be out for another three years--well, this is also interesting,
because electronic currency transactions are going to start in a few
weeks in the--with the euro, but the actual currency won't exist for a
few years.  So it's complete inversion of the way in which currency
and transactions have existed before.
<p>
But the actual physical design of this money is that it--on
bills, I believe--if I'm remembering correctly-- the buildings on
the design are abstract renditions of buildings that don't really
exist but that mark certain-- the development of European
architecture.  So you'll have something from the gothic--a gothic
cathedral that doesn't exist, maybe. I'm guessing--something in
a classical style--the non-existent public buildings that are
going to be on the back of these bills.
<p>
On the coins--there's been a lot of discussion over how -- I just did
a piece on this recently, so this is in my mind, but it
seems sort of germaine.  Half of--one side of the coin is going
to be the same throughout Europe and the other side of the coin is
going to be differing--is going to differ from country to country.
But since the Euro is going to circulate all over Europe, everybody's
going to have coins with a little bit of everything on them.  Now
this is a sort of--it seems to me, looking at this, it's such
an artificial sort of creation of the public.  It may, over time, end
up proving that economic transactions create a public where
there is none.  I don't know, but it's sort of interesting that this
question of how to create a public is being enacted now in
another realm that we wouldn't think of.  Well, I
have other examples, but that'll do.
<p>
FRANZEN:  I have no idea where the leverage might come from,
but I think there is a hunger for that sense of ceremony and that
sense of -- I think -- speaking of New York, Giuliani's
success has a lot to do with the -- almost global distress over the
lack of a safe public space.  And the popularity of museums like
this--museums in general, of coffee bars, bookstores, it all
speaks to there being a hunger and a feeling that things have gone too
far in the other direction.  But, again, that's no suggestion of
leverage.
<p>
WIEBE:  The commission's code word this time around and
for previous times, too, is `conversation.' Sometimes they talk about
it as exchange or discussion or debate or interaction, but it has to
do with words.  It has to do with talking with one another.  Are those
things you're talking about as possible levers?  Do you think that
this will encourage conversation, this will encourage the kind
of--it's the wrong word perhaps--literal public exchanges that lead to
policy outcomes or decisions in public life?  If we have enough euros
in circulation, we will--it will lead to conversation?  Enough
bookstores, and we will learn to converse?  I sense a gap
between--there's nothing wrong, obviously, with what you said, but a
gap between those things you see as levers and the agenda
that's immediately before the commission.
<p>
POPKIN:  One obvious source of leverage--and I don't
know if it's a good source or a bad source--are all the groups of
people who never meet very often, who talk with each other in --  I
guess chat rooms and news groups.  I mean, there's an enormous number
of kinds, and it's clearly a very positive thing when it's applied to
diseases.  The number of people who get help with an oncological
problem...
<p>
Unidentified Man:  Yes, absolutely true.
<p>
POPKIN:  ...or an Alzheimer's problem...
<p>
Unidentified Man:  Right.
<p>
POPKIN:  ...in the family is e--is extraordinary.
<p>
Unidentified Man:  Right.  Right.  Support group.  Yeah.
<p>
POPKIN:  It's--and it's certainly changed the entire
practice of medicine in this country that patients very
often--incredibly often know more than the doctors because they've
been able to specialize for a week in a particular branch of a
particular virus.  But the question is, how does it change our notions
of representation that the people we're closest to politically aren't
part of any geographic place we live?  Is this just another interest
group?  Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
<p>
Unidentified Man:  Good.
<p>
WIEBE:  Well--yes, Jim.
<p>
JAMES FISHKIN:  Yeah, I have a question for Sam Popkin, since he's here.
Sam--I'm over here, Sam.  Thank you.  The--because I'd like him to
bring his very influential work on cues and euristics from "The
Reasoning Voter" that he alluded to in--in this discussion.  Sam
became -- there's a famous example at the beginning of
his book of President Ford campaigning in the primary in San Antonio
choking on a tamale.  And...
<p>
Mr. POPKIN:  Which he forgot to unhusk.
<p>
JIM:  He forgot to unhusk, thank you, yes.  And so--then Sam concludes
from the fact that--that--or, Sam says that--that Mexican-American
voters in Texas should conclude from the fact that he didn't know to
unshuck the tamale that he knew very little about their interests and,
therefore, they could make a voting decision about that with what Sam
calls low information rationality.  Now Sam has become something of a
poster child for the proposition, and I don't think he quite endorses
this proposition, but it's relevant to the work of the
commission--that low-information rationality is all that voters need
and that--therefore, and his name has been invoked in--in discussions
about whether we need a more deliberative democracy, a more thoughtful
democracy, citizens being more informed--his name is constantly
invoked, whenever I discuss this, as, `Well, Popkin says
low-information rationality is good enough.  Why do we need to go
to a lot of trouble to get more informed citizens?'
<p>
Now I've got a two-part question.  One part...
<p>
(laughter)
<p>
POPKIN:  I--I'm sorry, but I thought you'd already asked it.
<p>
(laughter)
<p>
FISHKIN:  That's part of my question, but I want to connect it
to this discussion today just for a second in the sense that we have a
tabloid news agenda which is a machinery for creating cues, in your
sense.  These cues--you know, Gary Hart sleeping with Donna Rice was a
cue, you know?  But the Republicans thought Clinton lying was going to
be a cue.  It didn't quite work that way.  Somehow, the public came to
an informed--or, came to a different judgment then or they picked a
different cue.  I'm not sure.  But the general danger that
I'm worried about is that given the tabloid character of our news
agenda, if public opinion works to some degree to the way that you
outlined, and I'm sure that it does work to some degree in the way
that you--that heuristics do work to some extent, then we've got a
process.
<p>
Unidentified Man:  They've got that on camera.
<p>
JIM:  Yeah.  Then we've got a process whereby the tabloid news agenda
will--will be throwing off these cues, many of which are completely
irrelevant to the real problems facing the country.  And if citizens
do make their decisions based upon just these little snippets of
impressions and sound bites, low-information rationality will
confirm--move changes in public opinion will have this interaction
between private life creating on s--creating sensational cues and we'll
never get a really functioning public discourse.  Now that's not a
criticism of your work; it's an endorsement of the fact that your work is
at least partly right -- But it is also partly wrong.  And the...
<p>
(laughter)
<p>
POPKIN:  I'm not going to ask him to repeat the question, I promise.
<p>
(laughter)
<p>
WIEBE:  The question is:  'Do you agree?'

<p>
POPKIN:  Thank you, Jim.  As Mark Twain would say...Um.  Ok There's two
little bits in there that are very, very important for the Commission.
One of them is that everything we know about voters is that they've been
overwhelmed by what's been thrown at them for at least fifty years -- and
we're only worrying about it now.  But the average person who isn't paying
much attention -- and there's a sort of constant thrity minutes of news
that people seem to have been putting in since World War II, and it's
maybe a little more on the Net, maybe it's a little on the radio, but it's
about thirty minutes a day of what's happened in the world, to Baby
Jessica down the well, or, you know, what's going on in Washington, and
of
of the things that is just as important today as it's always been to the
voters, and it's relevant to the
commission.  It's not what they know as much as it is who they know.
A lot of what goes on, whether it's deciding that this was or was not
a good time to bomb Iraq, is what the icons say.  You know, they
have to try-- they wheel out Kissinger and Eagleburger
and Kirkpatrick and Vance and Schwarzkopf, and people sort
of sense they're all on this together or they're divided; it's
politics or it's national interest, and they figure something out.
And a lot of this is understanding where the icons come from.
<p>
The other part of it is that even though there is a national
conversation, and it goes from Don Imus to Walter Cronkite, and
there's the high track and the low track and people are very good at
playing on the low track and then thinking about the high track when
it comes time to vote.
<p>
WIEBE:  Yes, Mari.
<p>
MARI FITZDUFF:  I was very struck by what is an obvious truism,
but until you say it perhaps one doesn't realize it, that we like to
talk about things, and--but they're often different to the things that
actually are important, the sort of mental chocolate that smooths our
conversations.
<p>
POPKIN:  That's a great phrase.  Is that new?
<p>
Ms. FITZDUFF:  Feel free.  And as a European, I must say, coming to
this part of the world one is struck by the amount of time given to
the conversation over impeachment/non-impeachment vs., presumably, the
consideration that was given to sending 200 cruise missiles to Baghdad
last night and the night before.  So what I want to put to the panel
is, given also that you've stated--and I must say, I was very
struck by the assessment that perhaps the Penn Commission doesn't
need to talk very widely because, in fact, there are very few who
influence the important decisions--how important is it that, in a
sense, I think what I heard you say--those who go to vote are
essentially those who are already in possession of much of the
knowledge and power, given the class system and the way that
votes.  I think you've far less voting here percentagewise
than we would have in Europe on many issues, because, you say, the
confusion of your system.
<p>
What I want to know is, how important is it that we widened the debate
about important issues?  Are we wasting our time?  Do we want to widen
the debate to include more, out of--because of a sense that this is how
democracy should work?  Or do we want to widen it from a pragmatic
base that if people don't talk about why we should bomb Iraq, then, in
fact, we get decisions that blow up in our face?  So how important is
it that we widen the inclusion within the debate on public issues?
<p>
POPKIN:  Can I--can I take a crack, very quick?  You know,
before I was invited here I knew about the commission, and I'll be
very honest.  I thought this was just the water buffalo commission.
And I--I--I just assumed that that's the whole point of this.  And, in
fact, when I looked at the material...
<p>
JAMIESON:  What a cynic.
<p>
POPKIN:  I'm sorr--yeah, I mean...
<p>
JAMIESON:  (unintelligible)
<p>
POPKIN:  OK, no more.  That's it for honesty.  That's it for
honesty.  In fact, when I looked at the material, I
saw a lot of very good material, and I actually took a day or two to
read a lot of the dialogue, and thought it was
extremely vvaluable.  And the fact that there's an education
gradient does not mean that people have to think about how to put
the pieces below the national level together for
the new situation.  I think that there's a lot that could be done
here with the commission, and I started out rather cynical about it,
to be honest.  And I'd like to think it was reading the material, not
being invited, that changed my mind.
<p>
FITZDUFF:  But could I just ask the--any other person on
the panel to comment on the value of it?  I mean, what is the value of
people sitting around their dining tables talking about whether Iraq
should be bombed or not, as opposed to whether Bob--you know, Bill
Clinton did this?
<p>
POPKIN:  Well, you know, every place in the question--in the
country, you know, instead of saying `Close, but no cigar,' they're
talking about "Wag the Dog," and there's a very healthy discussion,
which it would have been nice to have at the time of the Gulf of
Tonkin and the Cuban missile crisis, about how much is this serious
vs.  how much is this cynical.  And, you know, there are times when
high-minded leaders complain that there's not enough trust in
government because they're not letting us bomb or they're not letting
us do this or do that, but in fact, right now people are asking the
questions about Iraq and whether it's necessary or not or whether it's
crying wolf.
<p>
WEISBERG:  I would--can I just...
<p>
WIEBE:  Sure, you can.
<p>
WEISBERG:  I mean, I think your question is just of capital
importance, and I think without any doubt it's extraordinarily
important for both of the reasons that you suggested, one pragmatic
and the other just in terms of how we develop discourse in this
country, that the broadest base of people in the country are
discussing serious issues.  And I think, although I agree andI
can't disagree with a pollster on the polls, and I'm somewhat
encouraged about the fact that when people who are otherwise silent in
the process go into the polling booth, they apparently are thinking
through important issues.  I just think that indicates that, if there
were a little bit more top-down in our own discussions of what
constitute important issues, we would immediately get a resonance
within individuals who I think, frankly, are perfectly capable
of understanding our federalist system.
<p>
I totally resist the conclusion that people are not voting in this
country as much as they do in Europe because our system is more
complex.  We have figures from--I think it's the next panel, although
they're conflicting--but at some point in the 19th--throughout the
19th century--I think I'm right, and there are all kinds of
explanations for why that happened -- 80 or 90 percent of the
people were going to the polls, though another person in the next
panel says that it was 20 percent.  So I'm a little confused by these
figures.
<p>
We had a town hall meeting the other day.  A Connecticut congressman
had a town hall meeting on tof--of--of empathetic of Kenneth Starr.  I
don't share that at all.  I
think his views have--are really aberrational.  His view of what
constitutes a legal process is continental in nature.  It's
inquisitorial.  It has very little to do with what most American
lawyers would understand as a process of investigation.  It is literal
truth-seeking.
<p>
And you brought in fundamentalism; I just don't think that a
majority of Americans hold those beliefs.  I think it's about 30
percent at any time.  Yet--and I think this could only have happened
because, apparently, the elite media-- and the
distinction in status between them, I think, is less than it used to
be -- yhe elite media decided that it was powerless to do anything
but--not only to report this; I mean at the very beginnings, at the
origins--but to foreground it--foreground it.  Page-one news, a lot of
other stuff getting pushed to the back of the paper.
<p>
Well, if everybody in the--in the society from the top down feels like
they have no control over what's going on, all we'll be interested in
looking at are the polls, the figures that tell us what our sense
of collective passivity and powerlessness is wreaking at any given
time.  And I think we can all do a lot better than that.
<p>
WIEBE:  One more question in the rear.
<p>
KENNETH REARDON:  Getting to your point, Bob, about where we find
leverage points, has the commission--or does it plan to -- sort of look
at local experiences that run counter to this trend?  I'd like to
suggest that Chicago, during the Harold Washington administration, was
a place and it was a time when the public commons was
reconstituted and expanded and extended to people in a place where,
quote, unquote, "the machine had had its day forever." In East St.
Louis, where I'm currently working, I think there's a similar process
going on.
<p>
WIEBE:  Eighty-four percent turnout in the Harold
Washington re-election.
<p>
REARDON:  And I think those exceptions to the rule are
interesting.   Bill White from Cornell would always s--recommend
to us to not just look at where the bulk of the observations are, but
those outlying observations which can give us some sense of what are
the necessary requirements, preconditions, processes, participants,
etc.  Because I believe if we can reconstitute the commons in Chicago,
under very, very difficult circumstances when the economy was much
less robust, and we're doing it in East St.  Louis, I think there's a
possibility and lessons to be drawn that the commission should take as
part of its research agenda, doing those cases and pulling out common
themes to provide some policy recommendations.
<p>
WIEBE:  On that positive note, ladies and gentlemen, thank
you very much.  Thank you.
