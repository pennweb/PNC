On Thursday, December 17th, the meetings took place at the architecturally
significant Getty Center.  Among the sessions that day were a discussion
of the cultural context of public discourse, the conduct of public

Participants for the sessions on Thursday included author Jonathan
Franzen, author Samuel Popkin, Edward Rothstein, cultural critic for the
New York Times, Professor Richard Weisberg, Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva
University, Dr.  Barry Munitz, President of the Getty Trust.

On Friday the 18th, the Commission turned its attention to building
discourse and community outside of the U.S. with examinations of recent
developments in South Africa, Northern Ireland, Israel, and Eastern Europe
featuring a presentation by Mr. Alex Boraine, Vice Chair of South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  Also participating were Mr. Robin
Wilson of Northern Ireland's Democratic Dialogue, and Professor G.M.
Tamas, the E.L.Wiegand Distiguished Visiting Professor at Georgetown
