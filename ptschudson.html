American social critics have worried about the decline, absence, or
insufficiency of leadership for a long time. In the l830s, many mourned
the passing of the founding generation and doubted that we should ever see
their like again. In l888, the British ambassador, James Bryce, published
his anatomy of American politics, with its famous chapter, "Why Great Men
Are Not Chosen Presidents." In France and Italy, he observed,
"half-revolutionary conditions have made public life exciting and
accessible," in Germany a strong civil service cultivated fine statecraft,
and in England, an aristocratic tradition drew men of wealth and leisure
to politics. Recruitment to American public life was not enhanced by any
of these factors but ensnared in the corruptions of party politics.
<p>
     Nearly a century later, in the wake of Watergate, "TRB" complained of
a "leadership shortage" and political theorist Benjamin Barber pointed to
an erosion of leadership -- and the conditions for leadership (a point to
which I shall return) dating to l945. A succession of what were widely
perceived as failed presidencies -- Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter,
together with a seemingly endless spate of political scandals, led to an
outpouring of concern about political leadership in the l980s. <p>
     It is hard to avoid concluding that this country was very fortunate
in its founding generation, and that indeed there was an abundance of
leadership at the founding of a quality that has rarely been equalled
anywhere in the history of the world. With a beginning like that, it would
be hard for any subsequent generation to measure up. But that
extraordinary cohort aside, there has not been any obvious rise or fall of
leadership capacities. If leaders seem to flounder particularly in our own
era (but I am not sure that they do, they may just flounder in different
ways), it has less to do with individual incapacity than with conditions
that make the exercise of leadership especially difficult. That is the
argument I would like to propose here. I think there are at least four
inter-related factors that make leadership especially difficult in the
United States for us today and at the same time make the difficulties of
leadership unusually visible.

<p>
<br><center><b>l. The vulnerability of public figures to
publicity.</b></center>
<p>
     This is a point no one neglects: that a combination of an aggressive
news media, government prosecutors and inspectors newly created or newly
empowered by government ethics legislation, increasingly restrictive
ethics laws for public officials and others, increasing numbers of
whistle-blowers in government (and in corporations) encouraged by norms of
open-ness, honesty, and freedom of information, and increasing numbers of
private watchdog organizations on the left, the right, and the "good
government" center all have contributed to what Suzanne Garment calls "a
self-reinforcing scandal machine." (1) Garment, a political scientist and
former Wall Street Journal correspondent, wrote an indictment of the
"scandal machine" during the Bush administration, a time at which liberals
were not particularly interested in what she had to say. They may be
listening now, and certainly her blistering attack on the independent
counsel law  ("...that jewel in the post-Watergate crown, has become more
trouble, more expense, and more danger than it is worth....The office has
a vast capacity for making big scandals out of smaller ones, and this is
something we no longer need") is echoed in liberal circles today. (2)
<p>
     These developments in the intersection of government, legislation,
and media have increased the personal risks and hazards for someone who
dares embark on a political career. The scandal machinery has also
contributed to a general public cynicism about politics which is, in
Garment's words, "a corruption even more dangerous than stealing money
from the public till." She argues that "a prosecutorial class with no
sympathy for human frailties can be a much greater danger to a democracy
than the simple peddling of influence." (3) On the other hand, recall
where the scandal machinery came from: from the rise of investigative
reporting when government was epitomized by Lyndon Johnson's lies to the
American public about Vietnam and Richard Nixon's contempt for the media
and the democratic process; from the rise of public interest organizations
dedicated to the protection of individual rights against governmental
arrogance and intransigence on voting rights for African-Americans, equal
employment opportunity for women, access to welfare for the poor, and
consumer rights against corporations. These reforms have had some
unintended and unfortunate consequences, but let's not forget the
significant shortcomings of the political system they sought to repair.
<p>
     All of the remarks are focused on formal political leadership, but
leadership in other fields has suffered from similar developments. A good
case is medicine where, for the same 30-year period, historian David J.
Rothman argues that the main development in medical practice is that "the
discretion that the profession once enjoyed has been increasingly
circumscribed, with an almost bewildering number of parties and procedures
participating in medical decision making." (4)
     Rothman cites a large number of contributing factors, from popular
resentment over the rapid rise in physicians' income after World War II,
to highly publicized scandals from l966 on over medical research conducted
without the informed consent of subjects to technological innovations that
contributed to the intensification of ethical quandaries over
extraordinary life-support measures at both the beginning and end of human
life. Most of all, in Rothman's analysis, after World War II physicians
became more connected to hospitals and hospitals less connected to
religious, ethnic, and neighborhood communities; the "professional
isolation and exclusivity" of doctors greatly increased. The symbolic
measure of this isolation was the rapid decline of the house call, which
represented less than one percent of doctor-patient contacts by the early
l960s. Then, after the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in the l960s,
government became the primary purchaser of medical services and newly
scrutinized the self-regulation of the medical profession -- often finding
that organized medicine operated as a self-protective guild more than a
self-policing profession.
<p>
     At the same time, as part of the rights revolution spawned by the
civil rights movement, "patients' rights" became an activist watchword and
by l972 the American Hospital Association adopted a Patient Bill of
Rights. Dramatic changes in medical practice ensued -- in l960 a minority
of physicians informed patients when they had cancer; by l980, informing
the cancer patient was the rule. A rights-orientation had entered medical
practice and, with it, both an increase in bureaucratic and legal controls
over medical decision-making and a growing climate of distrust. (5)
<p>
     It cannot be said of the hospital today as historian Charles
Rosenberg wrote of its nineteenth century predecessor that "boundaries
between hospital and home were...indistinct" or that the hospital
superintendent "would see every patient every day, that he would know all
their names and be aware of their personal situations, just as he knew the
cook and laundress and coachman, all of course resident in the
hospital." (6) Of course, the early nineteenth century hospital provided
little in the way of effective therapy and its paternalism provided only
"ambiguous benefits." (7) The pre-World War II hospital was utterly
dominated by physicians and a professionally modulated paternalism.
Contemporary medical practice suffers from a newly intensified
vulnerability to the market, but also from a newly institutionalized
accountability to the individual patient, community and media review of
the ethics of practice, and governmental oversight. Leadership in medicine
is confined more than ever -- and for some very good reasons -- by the
requirement that it must listen to, please, or placate a wider range of
publics than ever before.

<p>
<br>

<center><b>2. The lack of common national purpose.</b></center>
<p>
     Political theorist Benjamin Barber argued in l975 that the short
supply of leadership has to do most directly with the absence of consensus
on national purpose. "For the past thirty years we have witnessed a
gradual but sure erosion of America's common purpose and national
consensus. There are today no leaders, only heads of factions; there is no
leadership of ideas, only a competition of ideologies; there is no
consensus, only an unstable balance of opposing interests." (8) This
strikes me as rhetorical, the sort of thing that might have been written
(and probably was) in any decade of our history. But Barber's general
point is well taken: leaders do not exist in a vacuum; in a democracy,
they personify and articulate group purposes. They lead by listening, they
initiate by responding, they inspire by their sensitivity to the public.
If groups have no coherent or identifiable purposes, the possibility of
leadership is denied.
<p>
     Today, when a wider array of stakeholders than ever before now play
legitimate roles in decision-making -- where the very term "stakeholder"
has a currency as never before, where there is difficulty in presuming
consensus because more and more people want to be consulted, lack of
common purpose is as much a strength of present culture as a defect. No
doubt the flourishing of "identity politics" poses new dangers to the
commonweal, but it also represents a genuinely affirmative new cultural
recognition of elements of the American mosaic that had essentially no
place in public discourse a generation ago: evangelical Christians, gays
and lesbians, Latinos, Asians and other new immigrant groups. Most
importantly, astonishingly, and troublingly of all for reigning
preconceptions about the character of American society, African-Americans
and women have achieved civil rights and political power. It is just
thirty years since enforcement of the Civil Rights Acts of l964 and l965
began to change the politics of race in this country, and not yet thirty
years since an organized women's movement began to transform relations
between men and women at home, in the workplace, and in the legislatures.
All of this contributes to a lack of common national purpose that makes
leadership difficult. This does not imply that we should want to recover
the common national purpose of the l930s, made possible by a great
depression, or of the l940s, made possible by a world war, or of the
l950s, made possible by the complacency of old-boy parties and community
elites.
    <p>
<br>
<center><b>3. Perennial democratic ambivalence about leadership increased
by
a set of traumatic shocks to faith in institutions.</b></center>
<p>
     The founding fathers distrusted government only slightly less than
they feared anarchy. They approved a Constitution that they believed in
only because it sought to blend a necessary level of energy in government
with a large number of checks upon it, checks internal to the federal
government in the separation of powers, checks written into the Bill of
Rights, and checks in a federal system that continued to locate most
political power in the separate states. Their distrust in government would
soon be coupled with a distrust of the people who dared aspire to run it;
the vote-seeking politician has never enjoyed a high reputation in
America. Even in the heyday of the American political party in the
nineteenth century, an anti-party mentality inherited from the founders
could not be expunged.
<p>
     A perennial distrust of politicians and government was exacerbated by
John F. Kennedy's assassination -- and the assassinations of Robert
Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. to follow. The President's
assassination, as Suzanne Garment observes, "played a large role in
arranging the discontents of those years into a pattern of systematic
suspicion about established institutions." (9) We should not overestimate
the importance of a single event to explain broad social and cultural
changes; at the same time, we should not let the uncongeniality of such
explanation to the social scientific mind blind us to its importance. The
nation was truly traumatized November 22, l963. Something that could not
happen here happened here, and no ethics law, no good will, no
investigative reporting, and no political reforms could ever put this
humpty dumpty together again.
<p>
     The specific traumatic events of the l960s helped torpedo public
confidence in government. Confidence levels, as measured by opinion polls,
declined rapidly between l964 and l974 and have by no means regained the
levels of the early l960s. In l964, 75 percent of Americans trusted the
federal government to do the right thing most of the time -- compared to
l5 percent in l995. But a general deterioration of traditional cultural
authority was also underway. Confidence in universities droped from 6l
percent to 30 percent, 55 percent to 2l percent for major corporations, 72
percent to 29 percent for medicine, and 29 percent to l4 percent for
journalism. (10)Deference declined as norms of participation, of sunshine
decision-making, of explicit and well defended individual rights were all
reaffirmed and taken with new seriousness. I do not think students or
even, in most cases, faculties participated in choosing college presidents
before the l960s; now the diverse stakeholders in a college or university
are routinely consulted and often have formal voting rights in
presidential selection. College presidents may be formally responsible to
a board of trustees but they are also accountable on a day-to-day basis to
every other constituency in the academic community, as the various
stakeholders are only too willing to remind them.
<p>
<br>
<center><b>4. The decentralization of power and the decomposition of the
leader.</b></center>
<p>
     Leaders have fewer autonomous options and less power than ever: this
is true of committee chairs in Congress, university presidents after the
Free Speech Movement, CEOs after the Chrysler bailout, the press after
Vietnam and Watergate, physicians and biomedical researchers after
Medicare, Medicaid, Tuskegee, and Karen Quinlan, and teachers and
principals after <u>Tinker v. United States </u>and the Americans With
Individual Disabilities Act. In Congress and in the federal
administration, leaders have larger staffs than ever, with consequently
more impersonal relationships between staff members and legislator or
secretary. This makes for declining staff loyalty; coupled with enhanced
opportunities for employees to go public to the news media. The new social
relations of politics are compost heaps for scandal-making. (11)
<p>
     At the same time, the authority structure in Congress has been
flattened. Internal reforms in the l960s weakened committee chairs,
created a proliferating array of subcommittees, and helped empower
freshman legislators relative to veterans. What has been seen as a "new
politician" style in which representatives emphasize constituent-services
more than policy leadership has helped incumbents create safer seats and
has increased their independence from the pressure of the White House or
party leadership in the Congress. (12) If that makes for individuals with
greater job security, it also gives them less reason for cooperation, or
even civility, with their colleagues -- let alone with the executive
branch.

<p>
<br>
<center><b>Conclusions</b></center>
<p>
     It would seem, at first glance, that it is better for journalists to
be probing and critical than not; that it is better for students, the
disabled, ethnic minorities, medical patients, and others to have
identifiable rights than not; that it is better that government officials
be held accountable for infractions of the law or public moral codes than
not; that it is better that the various stake-holders to vital political
and ethical decisions have a voice in those decisions than that the
decisions be made by paternalistic authorities behind closed doors. It
therefore would seem, at first glance, that the American political and
cultural world has seen remarkable progress in the past thirty to forty
years. <p>
     In my own view, all this is so. The social changes of the past two
generations have been extraordinary. At the same time, irony is part of
the human experience, and it should not be surprising that progress exacts
a price. In the case of the flattening and democratizing of cultural
authority in our day, part of the price has been to thwart public
leadership, to gridlock public action, and to muddle public conversation.
My own sense is that whatever solutions we may contemplate for making
leadership more possible (and followership more respectable) should show a
measure of patience with the novelty of the present conditions for
leading.
