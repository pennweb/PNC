The December 1997 plenary meeting of the Penn National Commission on
Society, Culture and Community built upon the <a
href=pubagendadec96.html>first meeting</a> of December, 1996
and the <a href=pubagenda6-97.html>second meeting</a> of June, 1997.  

This meeting was focused upon public behavior and the responsibility
of institutions.  Four invited speakers led sessions which addressed
the important institutions of professional sports, colleges and 
universities, government, and the military.

<p>

<ul><li>Judith Rodin, Chair of the Commission and President of the
University of Pennsylvania, <a href=lapchickintro.html>welcomed</a> the

values with the competitive ethos of athletics -- on the behavior of
athletes, sports fans, and the larger society.

discourse.

<p><li>Bill Bradley, Former United States Senator (NJ).  In this

development of a "robust and diverse public discourse."
